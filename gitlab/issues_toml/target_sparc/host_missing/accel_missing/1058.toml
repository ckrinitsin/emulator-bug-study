description = """The NetBSD appears to boot to the login prompt successfully, but when the login prompt appears, the system doesn't appear to recognize keyboard input and so I cannot login (I can't seem to boot into single user mode for the same reason). I can see the characters being typed on the terminal, but pressing the Enter key to submit input results in nothing.

I've confirmed that this is an issue with NetBSD because I also attempted to spin up a Solaris 8 VM and a Solaris 2.6 VM with the `-nographic` flag turned on, and I was able to log in and interact with both of those virtual machines."""
reproduce = """1. Use RHEL 8.6 as the base OS (**Update:** I've discovered that this error occurs under a different host OS too (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS in my case)
2. Start the NetBSD VM running the command as specified above"""
