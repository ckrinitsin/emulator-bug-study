description = """Experimenting with SPARC emulation, I noticed that the results of the UltraSparc fmul8x16 instruction don't appear to match the behaviour of real silicon (aka it doesn't appear to work at all -- in the test program, the result seems to be always 0).  Other VIS instructions I tried seem to be OK (I have not tried all of them).

The same problem is observed both in 64-bit (qemu-sparc64) and 32-bit (qemu-sparc32plus) applications."""
reproduce = """1. Compile the attached test program (which exhaustively tests all possible combinations of 16-bit and 8-bit inputs) with gcc:
   ```
   sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -static -Os -mcpu=ultrasparc -mvis -o test_fmul8x16 test_fmul8x16.c
   ```
2. Run it in qemu-sparc64:
   ```
   qemu-sparc64 -cpu 'TI UltraSparc II' ./test_fmul8x16
   ```
3. Observe almost all tests fail.

   Running the exact same compiled binary on a real UltraSparc II CPU gives all pass results."""
