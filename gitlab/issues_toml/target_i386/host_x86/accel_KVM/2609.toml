description = """When starting the installation of Windows XP  when using a virtioblk device you immediately get a bluescreen: `STOP: 0x000000A5 (0x00000002, 0x8A1A6008, 0xE1018808, 0x8A1B7F00)`. I think this happens even before it loads the SATA drivers that are slipstreamed in the ISO.

After a lot of Googling about this error 0x000000A5 I found some posts suggesting that changing the machine type from `q35` to `pc-q35-2.10` solves the issue. And it worked. Anything above 2.10 (for example 2.11) and the bluescreens return.

So I always used this solution, but in QEMU 9.1.0 it warns that `pc-q35-2.10` will be removed soon. This would mean there is no way anymore to install XP to a SATA disk unattendly."""
