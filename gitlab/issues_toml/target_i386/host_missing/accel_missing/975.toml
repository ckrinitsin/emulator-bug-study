```

The first attempt at `lxc snapshot v1 --stateful` caused this in the `lxc info v1 --show-log` log output:

```
qemu-system-x86_64: qemu_savevm_state_complete_precopy_non_iterable: bdrv_inactivate_all() failed (-1)
```

The second attempt caused this:

```
qemu-system-x86_64: ../block.c:6757: bdrv_inactivate_recurse: Assertion `!(bs->open_flags & BDRV_O_INACTIVE)' failed.
```

Which crashed QEMU completely and caused the VM to die.
Nothing relevant showed up in dmesg, so this wasn't caused by an obvious seccomp or apparmor policy issue."""
