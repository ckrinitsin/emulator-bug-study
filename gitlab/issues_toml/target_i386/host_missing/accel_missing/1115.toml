description = """When trying to boot an MBR Windows guest with SeaBios, it is stuck at the blue Windows boot logo, before the loading circle.
Changing the vGPU doesn't help, 0% cpu load just frozen. Even if I boot a WinPE iso, the same happens.
Even after 30 minutes, the same.
Rebooted host multiple times.
Since SeaBios is the default in qemu and virt-manager I imagine many VMs are installed as MBR and thus will be stuck.
To boot the VM I have to:
- switch to UEFI (TianoCore)
- boot WinPE iso
- use proprietary software to convert the Windows disk from MBR to GPT
Then it boots just fine but I imagine not many users will be able to do this."""
