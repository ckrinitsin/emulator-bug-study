3. Wait until image is loaded, connect via vnc or provide login/password in stdio
4. Initiate shutdown with `sudo shutdown -P now`
5. See that VM indefinitely shutdowns
6. Kill VM from host system with kill -9 <qemu-system-x86_64-process-pid>
7. Recompile qemu with -O0
8. Repeat steps 2-4
9. See that vm successfully stopped, and qemu process exited with code 0"""

Probably there is some compiler optimisation which prevents qemu threads from receive shutdown signal or appropriate notification from another threads.

The compiler version with which qemu is built:
```bash
% cc --version
Apple clang version 14.0.3 (clang-1403.0.22.14.1)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin22.4.0
Thread model: posix
