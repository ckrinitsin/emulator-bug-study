description = """If we want to create a gic with supported irq number 992, we need to set the `num-irq` property to 992 + 32 while 32 is the extra SGI number. But there is a problem, when QEMU initialize GICv3, it will check the variable `num_irq <= 1020 && (num_irq & 32) == 0`, which will lead to error abort. So there is no way to bypass the ```num_irq <= 1020``` check and we cannot use irq number bigger than 992 while in ARM GIC specification, irq number < 1020 should all be aviliable to use."""
