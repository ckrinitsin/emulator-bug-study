description = """In U-Boot CI, we started to update from v8.2.0 to v9.2.3 and found that the vexpress_ca9x4 platform was now failing one of the CI tests. I have reconfirmed the problem on top of tree QEMU, and bisected the failure to commit [59754f85("target/arm: Do memory type alignment check when translation disabled
")](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/59754f85ed35cbd5f4bf2663ca2136c78d5b2413). I have also re-verified the test is fine on a physical platform with a Cortex-A9 that is as follows (per the RM):
```
