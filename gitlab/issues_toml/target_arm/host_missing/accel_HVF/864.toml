description = """HVF's virtual counter diverges from `CLOCK_VIRTUAL` when the host sleeps and causes the inconsistency between Linux's system counter and everything else.

HVF's virtual counter apparently relies on something similar to `mach_absolute_time`, which stops when the host sleeps and resumes after it wakes up. However, `CLOCK_VIRTUAL` is implemented with `mach_continuous_time`, which continues even while the host sleeps. Linux uses the virtual counter as the source of the system counter and sees inconsistencies between the system counter and the other devices."""
reproduce = """1. Launch Fedora.
2. Compare the time shown at the top of the guest display and one at the top of the host display. The difference should be less than 2 minutes.
3. Let the host sleep for 3 minutes.
4. Compare the times again. The difference is now greater than 2 minutes."""
additional = """Here are solutions I've came up with so far. There are trade-offs but any of them should be better than the current situation. I'm happy to implement one if the maintainers have decided which one is the best or figure out a superior alternative.
- Implement `cpus_get_virtual_clock` of `AccelOpsClass` with `mach_absolute_time`. It would make HVF inconsistent with the other accelerators. Linux also expects the virtual clock is "continuous" and it leaves the divergence from the real time.
- Request XNU `HOST_NOTIFY_CALENDAR_CHANGE` to update the virtual clock with the continuous time. The interface is undocumented.
- Use `IORegisterForSystemPower` to update the virtual clock with the continuous time. It is undocumented that the interface handles every cases where `mach_absolute_time` and `mach_continuous_time`, but it actually does if I read XNU's source code correctly."""
