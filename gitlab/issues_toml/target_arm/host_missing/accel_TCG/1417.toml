description = """After upgrading to QEMU v7.2.0 from v7.1.0, when hitting an instruction breakpoint on a memory address that is translated by 2 stages of translation, and is not already cached in the TLB, QEMU fails the assertion at target/arm/ptw.c:301 (`assert(fi->type != ARMFault_None);`).

I believe this was introduced in f3639a64f602ea5c1436eb9c9b89f42028e3a4a8 (@rth7680), since in that commit the failure check for the return value of `get_phys_addr_lpae()` changed from checking for true (meaning failure) to checking for false (which actually means success)."""
