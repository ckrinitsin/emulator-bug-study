additional = """Old userspace (eg Debian jessie, Ubuntu xenial) does not work within qemu 8.1-rc2 aarch64 linux-user emulation, since commit 59b6b42cd3446862567637f3a7ab31d69c9bef51 .  My guess is that old userspace isn't prepared for recent CPU features, but it still smells strange.

Not all programs segfaults. dash works, ls or bash does not.

A chroot is easier in this case, since many old programs don't run inside current environment, like asserting while reading locale-specific information.  To run debootstrap and to enter the resulting chroot, a working qemu-aarch64 binfmt_misc setup is needed.

Reverting the mentioned commit makes everything work again."""
