reproduce = """1. build QEMU with assertions enabled (e.g., `configure --enable-debug-tcg`).

This issue happens because for ld1sb, nregs=0 in `sve.decode`:
```
# SVE contiguous load (scalar plus scalar)
LD_zprr         1010010 .... ..... 010 ... ..... .....    @rprr_load_dt nreg=0 
```
As a result, in do_mem_zpa is called with n_reg=0, which becomes mte_n inside do_mem_zpa.
Since mte_n==0, and mte_active, then 
```c
desc = FIELD_DP32(desc, MTEDESC, SIZEM1, (mte_n << msz) - 1);
```
sets (0) - 1 == -1 to the field, which also sets the upper bits of `desc`.
The `desc` with upper bits set to 1 is used to call:
```c
desc = simd_desc(vsz, vsz, zt | desc);
```
Inside `simd_desc`, the last parameter is named `data` and it fails the assertion:
```c
tcg_debug_assert(data == sextract32(data, 0, SIMD_DATA_BITS))
```
