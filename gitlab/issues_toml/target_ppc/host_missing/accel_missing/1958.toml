description = """When executing PPC instruction "msgsnd r3. with r3 = 0x08000001" an DOORBELL CRITICAL exception is raised on core number 1. But this exception is masked by MSR\\[EE\\] bit, the MSR\\[EE\\] should be set to 1 in core1 to get this exception. But the NXP E500MCRM.pdf reference manual indicates that MSR\\[CE\\] is the mask bit for DOORBELL_CRITICAL Exception."""
