description = """The problem is fairly nondescript, but it seems to be a chipset regression that popped up between QEMU 8 and QEMU 9. I had a Windows NT 4 VM that I tried booting in the latest QEMU update after a while of not using it, and it just flat-out refused to do that, outputting the ``INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE`` error. Any attempt to boot from the hard drive or reinstall the OS from the CD image would return the same bluescreen, and would show the very message shown in the title in the process log."""

5. Launch the installer by running ``cd:\\mips\\setupldr``."""
