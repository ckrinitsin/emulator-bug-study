additional = """I have a patch for this that I will be submitting to trivial-patches. This is not enough to emulate Octeon specific binaries alone. For small binaries mapping the `CVMSEG_LM = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF8000 - 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF9FFF` to empty RAM and using this patch is enough. There are additional support issues for `N32` binaries that will require a separate issue.
