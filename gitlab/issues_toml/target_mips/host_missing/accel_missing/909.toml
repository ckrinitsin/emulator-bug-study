description = """**Note: Before trying to reproduce this issue, have a look at issue 843 - the binfmt-misc magic for n32 needs to be fixed.**

Trying to chroot into a mips n32 installation fails with 
```
/bin/bash: error while loading shared libraries: /lib32/libc.so.6: cannot read file data
```
however, bash, libc.so.6, and qemu all exist and have the proper abi

The problem occurs for both big and little endian N32 ABI. O32 and N64 work fine. The same N32 binaries also work fine on native hardware."""
