```
[FATAL tini (1)] PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER is unavailable on this platform. Are you using Linux >= 3.4?

The issue has been observed by multiple people on Apple silicon Macs, e.g. in these issues:
https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6620#issuecomment-1694380189
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator/issues/1735"""
