description = """This issue is **not caused by my OS**, as it runs perfectly under VMware and other emulators.

However, when using QEMU, the emulator sometimes randomly **crashes or aborts** during boot or early execution. The crash is **inconsistent** â€” sometimes it runs, sometimes it fails immediately.

QEMU fails with an **assertion failure** in `qemu_mutex_lock_iothread_impl`"""
