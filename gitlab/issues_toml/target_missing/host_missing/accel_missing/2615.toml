reproduce = """1.The QEMU process sends a `CMD_GET_TPMESTABLISHED` control command to the swtpm.
2.If the swtpm is not currently active (`tpm_running` is false), it responds to the QEMU process with an err_not_running message, which has a fixed size of 4 bytes.
(Reference: https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm/blob/master/src/swtpm/ctrlchannel.c#L938)
3. However, the QEMU process expects to receive a valid response (ptm_est est) of 8 bytes. Consequently, the QEMU process will be blocked in the recv_msg function if the response does not match the expected format."""
additional = """After analysing the source codes in `tpm_emulator.c`, we found that qemu does not process the unexpected ctrol command response from the swtpm correctly (e.g. `CMD_GET_TPMESTABLISHED`).
