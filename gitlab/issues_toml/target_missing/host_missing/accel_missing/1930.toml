description = """We have cross compiled a simple hello world program for QNX SDP 7.1.0 on Ubuntu Focal x86_64. Running the binary using qemu-aarch64 results in segmentation fault error.

```
   $ qemu-aarch64 -L /home/vsts/qnx710/target/qnx7/aarch64le ./hello-world
   qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
   Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

We also tried Ubuntu Jammy which has qemu-aarch64 v6.2.0 but got the same error.
Can you tell us how we can emulate the binary using QEMU emulator that is built for QNX on x86_64 platform? Any help would be much appreciated."""
reproduce = """1. Download QNX SDP from QNX software center https://www.qnx.com/download/group.html?programid=29178.
2. Write a simple hello world program.

```
     #include <stdio.h>
     
     int main(void) {
         return printf("Hello World!");
     }
```

3. Source QNX SDP to set some environment variables.

   `$ source ./qnx710/qnxsdp-env.sh`

4. Compile using the QNX compiler.

   `$ qcc -Vgcc_ntoaarch64le -o hello-world hello-world.c`

5. Running the binary as it is results to:

```
   $ ./hello-world
   aarch64-binfmt-P: Could not open '/usr/lib/ldqnx-64.so.2': No such file or directory
```

5. Running using QEMU emulator results to segmentation fault.

```
   $ qemu-aarch64 -L /home/vsts/qnx710/target/qnx7/aarch64le ./hello-world
   qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped  
   Segmentation fault (core dumped)
