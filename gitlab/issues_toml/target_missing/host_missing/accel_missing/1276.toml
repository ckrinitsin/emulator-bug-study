Blurry display https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67585967/197484538-fde750aa-8982-4ac2-9d83-3861f6411a31.png

Display with 1.00 scale https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67585967/197484417-afd1d1c5-5ea1-46ce-82c5-fa8d9b2df459.png

It was suggested in the SDL issue (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/6438#issuecomment-1289513402) that it's caused by the `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI` not being set. However, after setting that flag, the display is sharp again but it's not scaled properly (boxed) https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/6438#issuecomment-1291663284, no idea what other changes need to be made."""
