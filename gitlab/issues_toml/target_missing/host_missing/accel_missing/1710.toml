This is what I come with myself:

`meson.build`:
```meson

qemu_src = get_option('qemu_path')
if qemu_src == ''
  qemu_src = '../..'
endif

incdir = include_directories(qemu_include)

plugins = [
  'execlog',
  'hotblocks',
  'hotpages',
  'howvec',
  'lockstep',
  'hwprofile',
  'cache',
  'drcov',
]

th = dependency('threads', required: true)
glib = dependency('glib-2.0', required: true)

foreach p: plugins
  library(p, p + '.c',
    include_directories: incdir,
    dependencies: [th, glib],
    override_options: ['b_lundef=false']
  )
endforeach
```

`meson_options.txt`:
```
option('qemu_path', type : 'string', value : '', description : 'Full path to the QEMU sources to build the plugin for')
