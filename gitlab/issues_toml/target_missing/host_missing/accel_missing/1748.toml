in fact, set discard="unmap" or not seems has `little impact` on the final result.
reproducible shell script.
```sh
#! /bin/sh

for i in {1..1000}; do
    for j in {1..27}; do
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test-$j bs=1M count=1 &
    done
    sync
    sleep 10
    rm -f /mnt/test-*   
    fstrim /mnt
done
```
MOUNT the device and run this script, problem happens about 30 minutes.

final result looks like:
