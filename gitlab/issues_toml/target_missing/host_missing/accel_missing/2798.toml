description = """I used to mount VDI with qemu-nbd and it worked, I could mount/unmount many times. Since VDI was 400 GB, I converted to Split2G VMDK.
In addition to file.vmdk, there are file-s001.vmdk, file-s002.vmdk..file-s201.vmdk 
With that, I can mount, but disconnect does not work. Tried also with `blockdev`, did not help, not sure if that is needed.
I know that with LV deactivation of volume group is needed before disconnect. Not aware if there is equivalent with Split VMDK.
Cannot say if issue in qemu-nbd or qemu vmdk driver.
Experienced in qemu 6.2.0 and also when upgraded to 9.0.2. May try later with master that seems to build 9.2.50."""
reproduce = """1. sudo modprobe nbd max_part=4 && sudo qemu-nbd -f vmdk -c /dev/nbd1 file.vmdk && sudo mount /dev/nbd1p1 /mnt/vmdk
2. sudo umount -l /mnt/vmdk && sleep 2 && sudo blockdev --flushbufs /dev/nbd1  && sleep 2 && sudo qemu-nbd -dv /dev/nbd1 
3. lsblk # see still nbd1"""
