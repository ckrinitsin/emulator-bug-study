```

It seems that `./configure` mistaken my dynamic library of bzip2 as able to compile under static compilation."""
reproduce = """1. `./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --static` with bzip2 only dynamicly installed and static library not installed
2. see output

You can see
```
    snappy support                               : NO
    bzip2 support                                : YES
    lzfse support                                : NO
```

which is wrong. Additionally, the compilation fails because the system only have bzip2 dynamicly but not staticly."""
