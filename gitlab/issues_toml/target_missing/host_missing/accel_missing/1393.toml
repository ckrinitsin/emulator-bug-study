description = """Section 5.10.2 of the AC97 specification (https://hands.com/~lkcl/ac97_r23.pdf)
shows the feasibility to support for rates other than 48kHZ. Specifically,
AC97_PCM_Front_DAC_Rate (reg 2Ch) should be from 8kHZ to 48kHZ.


An adversary can leverage this to crash QEMU.

A nornal 48kHZ setting is like this.

```
ac97_realize
  open_voice
    as->freq = 0xbb80 # 0xbb80=48000
    AUD_open_out
      audio_pcm_create_voice_pair_out (sw is NULL)
        audio_pcm_sw_init_out
          sw->info.freq = as->freq (in audio_pcm_init_info())
          sw->ratio = ((int64_t) sw->hw->info.freq << 32) / sw->info.freq
          samples = ((int64_t) sw->HWBUF->size << 32) / sw->ratio (in audio_pcm_sw_alloc_resources_out())
```

A non-48kHZ setting is like this. Since `as->freq` is too small, `sw->ratio` is
too large. Finally, `samples` is zero, failing the audio_calloc() in
audio_pcm_sw_alloc_resources_out().

```
nam_writew
  open_voice
    as->freq = 0x6
    AUD_open_out
      audio_pcm_sw_init_out (sw is not NULL)
        sw->info.freq = as->freq (in audio_pcm_init_info())
        sw->ratio = ((int64_t) sw->hw->info.freq << 32) / sw->info.freq
        samples = ((int64_t) sw->HWBUF->size << 32) / sw->ratio (in audio_pcm_sw_alloc_resources_out())
        audio_calloc(.., samples, ) (in audio_pcm_sw_alloc_resources_out())
```"""

patch so that the warning about the invalid freq will be gone."""
