description = """I can't get USB passthrough to work sufficiently well with wifi modems such as the RTL8187L or Atheros AR 9271.

I only use the VM as a router since the host OS doesn't have drivers for any external wifi modems. This is a setup I've used flawlessly many times in the past with other VMs on x86 platforms for many years, but with ARM it's been one fail after another. Parallels does work with the exact same host and guest, but fails in the networking area (plus it's expensive and overkill for something this simple). I mention this because I know the guest drivers work 100% with a different VM."""
reproduce = """1. Run any Linux on QEMU on any Apple Silicon mac
2. Attempt to use a Atheros AR 9271 USB device
3. Various fails including 
      a) USB device not showing up (lsusb)
      b) device shows up and Linux attempts to attach driver, but fails (lsmod shows driver loaded but no interface listed on iwconfig)
      c) interface shows up (never got the Atheros this far, but RealTek does) but the interface is slow, corrupts data, etc. 
      d) after re-attaching several times it will eventually stop attaching at all requiring a MacOS system reboot, which is really annoying for my workflow.

It's basically non-functional for me. Atheros is 100% non-functional and RealTek 10% works (well enough to *sometimes* connect to the AP, but usually craps the bed if you try to do anything as simple as run a dhcp client to fetch the IP).

If anyone knows of any other Linux ARM on Mac ARM vm solutions that allow USB passthrough please let me know. Unfortunately, VirtualBox os currently not one of them."""
