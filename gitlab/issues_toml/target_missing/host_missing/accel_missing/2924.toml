description = """When attached to qemu-x84_64's gdbserver via gdb, it is not possible to interrupt the binary being emulated. Usually, Ctrl-C will interrupt a running binary from gdb and I believe (though have not tested) it works in qemu-system.

First Ctrl-C will do nothing and second will prompt to stop debugging.

Stop debugging it? (y or n)
