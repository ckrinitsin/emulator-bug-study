description = """The riscv64-debian-cross-container job is allowed to fail and has been failing for some time. If it fails all the time then running it is a waste of electricity and the test should be disabled. Or maybe someone familiar with the test can rectify things and get it passing again. Either way, it's time for someone familiar with the test to review it.

Here it a recent CI failure:
