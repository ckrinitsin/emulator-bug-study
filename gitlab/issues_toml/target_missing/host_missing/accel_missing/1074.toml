The issue was not visible on earlier versions, but I don't know which one exactly was it.\\
I can only say, it was still working in April and it was possible that I was using Fedora 36 Beta.

Copying the file instead of using a symlink can be used as a workaround.

The binary should print some debug stuff, like avaliable memory regions and end with an infinite halt-loop."""
