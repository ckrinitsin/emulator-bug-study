commit 64f75f57f9d2c8c12ac6d9355fa5d3a2af5879ca

    net: Reinstate '-net nic, model=help' output as documented in man page
    
    While refactoring the NIC initialization code, I broke '-net nic,model=help'
    which no longer outputs a list of available NIC models.
    
    Fixes: 2cdeca04adab ("net: report list of available models according to platform")
