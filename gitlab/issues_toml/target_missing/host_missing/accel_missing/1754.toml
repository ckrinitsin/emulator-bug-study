qemu-system-aarch64: Invalid SD card size: 29.7 GiB
SD card size has to be a power of 2, e.g. 32 GiB.
You can resize disk images with 'qemu-img resize <imagefile> <new-size>'
(note that this will lose data if you make the image smaller than it currently is).

2. Attempt to start a guest OS with the SD card attached. See the command above.
3. You will get an error saying that the card size is not a power of two."""
