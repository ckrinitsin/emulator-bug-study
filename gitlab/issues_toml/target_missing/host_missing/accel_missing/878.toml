```

The issue is that the PCI bridge `0000:3a:02.0`, is used by "pcieport" kernel driver and not "vfio-pci".
After manually unbinding the PCI bridge from it's driver and binding it to vfio-pci qemu successfully attaches it to the VM.

I saw online that qemu is suposed to automaticly unbind devices from the host, make them available to the VM and restore them to their previous state once the VM is shutdown. 
This is not happening here."""

additional = """After reading [kernel vfio doc](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/vfio.html#vfio-usage-example), I can see that `ls -l /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:3b:00.0/iommu_group/devices` was supposed to list the PCI bridge, but it is not the case for me.

I could only notice the presence of the bridge by looking in the `/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:3b:00.0` symlink.

Maybe qemu misses it because of that ?"""
