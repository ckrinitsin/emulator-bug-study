description = """Beginning with QEMU 9.1.1, SPICE is unable to route audio from the guest to host. This affects `virt-viewer` as well as `Looking Glass`. Reverting packages to 9.1.0 restores functionality.

I've confirmed https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/6d03242a7e47815ed56687ecd13f683d8da3f2fe caused the regression, applying reverse patch to 9.1.1 resolves the issue"""
