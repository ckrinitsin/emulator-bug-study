description = """After running the command above, clicking on "Try Ubuntu" and adjusting the guest display resolution in GNOME to the native resolution, pressing ctrl+alt+f yields a "fullscreen" that only covers the QEMU window but not the entire host screen. This is not the case when switching to fullscreen while the boot screen is active or running `qemu-system-x86_64 -display gtk,full-screen=on`. 

The problem also occurs when replacing `-device qxl-vga` by `-device VGA,vgamem_mb=64`. The problem however does not occur when using `-device virtio-vga` instead of `-device qxl-vga` or `-display sdl` instead of `-display gtk`."""

5. Press ctrl+alt+f"""
