additional = """The problem can be worked around by changing the line

```

to

```
subprojects="keycodemapdb libvfio-user berkeley-softfloat-3 berkeley-testfloat-3 dtc"
```

in `archive-source.sh`.

Additionally, https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/W32#Docker_based_cross_builds is outdated.
```
make docker-test-mingw@fedora V=1 DEBUG=1 J=4
```
should be
```
make docker-test-mingw@fedora-win64-cross V=1 DEBUG=1 J=4
```

Additionally, i would suggest to create and enter build directory before calling configure and also add the make commands as shown in the "Steps to reproduce" section of this ticket."""
