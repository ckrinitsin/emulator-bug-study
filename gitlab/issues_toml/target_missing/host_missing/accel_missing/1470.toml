description = """I've been using the "GD5434 v1.25f, 1280x1024x64K Smlfnt" driver (from sp2904.exe, https://archive.org/download/Windows-3.1-WING-doom inside cirrus.zip) with Fedora's qemu build for years, which is the best version of that driver that I could find, and which works quite nicely apart from a font problem right after startup, and is a lot faster than the standard (patched) SVGA driver. Opening and closing File Manager will get rid of the font corruption. After an upgrade to Fedora 37, I noticed that the mouse cursor was not displayed anymore, which I bisected to this git commit: cb8962c146"""
