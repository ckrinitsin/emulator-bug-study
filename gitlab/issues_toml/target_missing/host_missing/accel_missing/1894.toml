description = """OpenCore wants me to use `AppleALC`, but to use _that_, I need the layout ID of the motherboard or something and I'm not sure how I'd do that since it's a QEMU VM. All I want to do is have some audio :(

So, how can I emulate audio with AppleALC + OpenCore/how can I get a layout ID that'll give me audio on a QEMU VM? Do note that I am using UTM (https://getutm.app/) (UTM uses QEMU and is basically a QEMU frontend)."""
reproduce = """1. Set up OpenCore and install Mac OS X 10.7
2. Copy across a .mp3 file
3. iTunes fails to play it due to no audio drivers/audio outputs"""
