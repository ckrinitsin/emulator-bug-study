I'll try not to waste your time and read as much as I can about your guidelines.
Would you advise me against trying to do this?
I'd like to know how hard you think this will be.

DISCLAIMER : I am still very much a newbie in embedded systems, I'm only in the first year of my master's degree in embedded systems."""
