description = """The main problem: while tracing relative events input_event_rel all mouse events are positive and seems to be the absolute x and y mouse position. When that happens ps2 sends a +x -y of a full 127 count."""
reproduce = """1. Trace input_event_rel
2. Observe that when moving the mouse the trace always shows positive values, that doesn't depend on what direction you move the mouse
3. Observe that the xrel and yrel is more like absolute positions"""
additional = """I noticed searching on sdl2 docs and some issues related to SDL2 mouse events that when you do not specify SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_MODE_WARP weird things happens, i tried adding SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_MODE_WARP, "1"); at the end of the sdl2 init function and the mouse events started to show normal values. I'm not sure if that's the correct way to solve the bug, but it seems to be."""
