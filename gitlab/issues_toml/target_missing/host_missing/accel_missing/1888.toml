description = """Since QEMU 7.2.0 when using `megasas` device the guest kernel is unable to I/O with the device (Input/output error) also producing errors messages in `dmesg` like these:
```
[   18.739344] critical target error, dev sda, sector 0 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x0 phys_seg 1 prio class 2
[   18.739925] Buffer I/O error on dev sda, logical block 0, async page read
[   18.740374] Dev sda: unable to read RDB block 0
```

Relevant options are: `-device megasas -blockdev driver=null-co,read-zeroes=on,node-name=null -device scsi-hd,drive=null` then in guest `modprobe megaraid-sas`. With qcow2 images - errors are the same.

I also tested that the same commands produce no errors on QEMU 6.0.0 - 7.1.0."""
