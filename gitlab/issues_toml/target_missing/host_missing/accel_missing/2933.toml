OpenCore config (not changed before update, so above suspicion):

Full OS X folder (without Installer.dmg):

How I've done Installer.dmg:
1. Go [here](https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2021/macos/031-0627-20210614-90D11F33-1A65-42DD-BBEA-E1D9F43A6B3F/InstallMacOSX.dmg)
2. `xar -xf` to .pkg
3. Show package contents to extracted .pkg
4. Here it is: InstallESD.dmg, which I've renamed to Installer.dmg"""
