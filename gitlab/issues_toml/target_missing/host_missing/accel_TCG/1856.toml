description = """I recorded bin file using **_rr=record_** command line. But it got stuck when replaying this record bin file. The icount number would never change after stucking if I typed _**info replay**_ with qmp command line.

I found that the following instructions should be a sequence of consecutive hardware interrupts after stucking once checking the trace log of 
both replay and record log using _**-d in_asm,int**_."""
