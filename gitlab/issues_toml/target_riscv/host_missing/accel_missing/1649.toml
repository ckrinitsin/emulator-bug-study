reproduce = """1. Create a test.s file and put these 4 lines of assembly into the file
2. In terminal, run: "riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ttext 0x80000000 -c test.s -o test", "riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy test -S -O binary test", and "qemu-system-riscv64 test -s -S"
3. In another terminal window, run [riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb -ex "target remote localhost:1234" -ex "layout asm"]. Keep running si command in gdb until you are at 0x80000000 where you shall see the first instruction as shown in line (1). Then keep going till you have stepped over the instruction shown in line (3). Now, run "p $mtvec" in gdb, you shall see its value being 0.
4. Redo the above steps without line (1), you shall see mtvec loaded successfully with the correct value."""
