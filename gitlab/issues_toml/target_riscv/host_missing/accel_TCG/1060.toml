reproduce = """1. Assemble and link `mtval-illegal.elf`. The code simply sets up a trap handler and generates an illegal instruction exception

2. Start QEMU with:

  ```
  qemu-system-riscv64 -cpu rv64,h=off -bios mtval-illegal.elf -nographic -icount shift=0 -s -S
  ```

3. Attach with GDB:

  ```
  gdb mtval-illegal.elf

  # Within GDB
  target extended-remote :1234
  break trap
  disp $mtval

  # Keep single stepping until breakpoint
  stepi
  ```

4. When control flow reaches `trap`, `mtval` is written with `0` instead of the encoding of `csrw time, x0` (`0xc0101073`)"""
additional = """Writing `0` to `mtval` on a illegal instruction trap is allowed by the specs, but since the [changelog of QEMU 7.0][changelog] says it should be supported, I would consider it a bug.

[changelog]: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/7.0#RISC-V

I encountered this when trying to figure out why my program worked with QEMU 6 but breaks with QEMU 7. It's more complicated, but in that case I managed to get `mtval` written with neither `0` nor the actual illegal instruction, but a different illegal instruction. I will try gathering up all the dependencies and write down the steps to reproduce if needed and if I find the time."""
