description = """This is RHEV with Tb's of VMs which need to be repaired due to a datacenter-wide (the real datacenter) power outage.

Each of these VMs are on individual LVs but qemu-img check fails to perform repairs:

Running qemu-img check or info on the LV (/dev/dm-*) works well but repairs cannot be completed:
