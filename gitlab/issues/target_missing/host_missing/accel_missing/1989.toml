    ui/console: allow to override the default VC

    If a display is backed by a specialized VC, allow to override the
    default "vc:80Cx24C".

    As suggested by Paolo, if the display doesn't implement a VC (get_vc()
    returns NULL), use a fallback that will use a muxed console on stdio.

    This changes the behaviour of "qemu -display none", to create a muxed
    serial/monitor by default (on TTY & not daemonized).
