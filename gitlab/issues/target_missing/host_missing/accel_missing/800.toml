reproduce = """1. Launch a QEMU virtual machine with `-usb -device usb-mtp,rootdir=/tmp,readonly=false` using any QEMU version above 6.0.0
2. Mount the MTP device using something:
   ```
   mkdir mtpDevice && jmtpfs mtpDevice
   ```
3. Try to write to the mtp device:
   ```
   touch mtpDevice/test
   ```
4. Observe that you will get an input/output error when trying to write to the device, like this:
   ```
   vm-test-run-mtp> client: must succeed: /nix/store/xmib7222ybr72iyycra4w386s8p1k4av-jmtpfsTest.sh >&2
