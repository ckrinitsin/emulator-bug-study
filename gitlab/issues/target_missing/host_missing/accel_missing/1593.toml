description = """When using `-netdev hostfwd=`..., qemu SLIRP uses `INADDR_ANY` instead of any bind address provided by the user. As a result, even if the user specifies to listen only on localhost (e.g. `-netdev user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:22-:22`), qemu will listen on `*.*`. This is a potential security issue (as it may unexpectedly expose the guest to internet or local network traffic)."""

Rather than hardcoding `INADDR_ANY`, qemu should respect the user-defined bind address."""
