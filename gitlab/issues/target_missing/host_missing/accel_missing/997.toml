- Works as expected without the iothread
- No issue with virtio-blk + iothread
- Same behavior regardless of io=threads/native/io_uring
- Same behavior with default vs increased queue count
- The issue is triggered when the guest OS initializes the virtio driver"""
reproduce = """1. Add virtio-scsi controller with iothread
2. Boot VM
3. Check per-thread CPU usage such as in htop"""
