description = """Hello everybody,
recently i have updated my environment from QEMU 7.1 (Build based from Upstream Code) to QEMU 7.2 (Build based from Upstream Code).
Since the patching went very well, i noticed that Live Migrations are not possible anymore.
It looks like that the Migration Process itself is running fine, but at the moment where QEMU wants to get the VM back live on the destination node, it crashes with the following error:

```
internal error: qemu unexpectedly closed the monitor: 2024-03-06T16:05:46.118520Z qemu-system-x86_64: get_pci_config_device: Bad config data: i=0x34 read: c8 device: dc cmask: ff wmask: 0 w1cmask:0

2024-03-06T16:05:46.120947Z qemu-system-x86_64: load of migration failed: Invalid argument
```

If i would stop/start the instance in question, live migration is back working.
This let me think that this might be an issue caused by the VM emulation process isn't running with the latest source of QEMU 7.2?

Could someone please help me to figure out how i could resolve this issue to unblock the live migration capability without restarting all of my instances?"""
reproduce = """1. Prepare to Test Systems
 - SOURCE      = Install with QEMU 7.1
 - DESTINATION = Install with QEMU 7.2
2. Start an example VM instance on the SOURCE
3. Update QEMU to 7.2 on the SOURCE
4. Start Live Migration from SOURCE to DESTINATION.
5. Error should be raised like mentioned above"""
