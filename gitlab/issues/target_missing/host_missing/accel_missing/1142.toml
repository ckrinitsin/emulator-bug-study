description = """When booting the QEMU with the 'kernel-hashes:true' property set for 'sev-guest' confidential virtualization, the contents of the `-kernel` file are measured by the firmware.

A remote tenant can then validate the measurement against its expected contents to see if the boot was trustworthy.

With the pc-q35-7.1 machine type the measurement always fails to validate against expected state.

Making the following code change

    hw/i386: pass RNG seed via setup_data entry
```

intentionally modifies the contents of the kernel image before passing it to the firmware, to inject a random seed. This will ensure the boot measuremnts are different every time.

This RNG seed functionality must NOT be used when AMD SEV is active."""
