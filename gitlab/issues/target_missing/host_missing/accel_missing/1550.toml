additional = """If vmport=off is **not** passed, at some point during startup (before graphical login manager appears) the guest switches to use vmmouse from PS/2 mouse. There it also requests usage of absolute input coordinates (VMMOUSE_REQUEST_ABSOLUTE). This code path works normal. Therefore the culprit might be in the guest.

Another way to reproduce the issue is to use -accel whpx under Windows host (no need to pass vmport=off there). It can be observed that the same guest doesn't attempt to switch to vmmouse there, just like passing vmport=off under Linux.

The problem does not exist on Linux host when -accel tcg is used in which case the guest doesn't attempt to switch to vmmouse."""
