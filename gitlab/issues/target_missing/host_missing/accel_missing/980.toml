description = """I am currently trying to use binary emulation to run a dynamically-linked executable C program that was written and compiled on a Solaris 8 VM. However, when I do so, I immediately get a bus error, and I'm not sure what the cause is. Below I'll delineate all of the steps I took to recreate this."""
reproduce = """1. Start Solaris 8 VM (this was done via QEMU, actually, and there are no issues here)
2. Write a simple `.c` program.
3. Compile that program with `/usr/local/bin/gcc`. The name of the program is `binary_emulation`.
4. Test program on the VM to ensure functionality.
5. Stop VM.
6. Mount `.qcow2` on the Linux host so I can easily extract files from it.
7. Copy the entire `/` directory off to `~/binary_emulation/target`
8. Copy `binary_emulation` to a separate directory.
9. `cd` to `.../qemu/build`
10. Run `./qemu-sparc -L ~/binary_emulation/target ~/binary_emulation/binary_emulation`"""
