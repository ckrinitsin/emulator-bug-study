reproduce = """1.install a windows guest with 128GB of memory and start it.

2.When the machine is stable, the VM internal memory usage is low,but is very high on host of qemu progress.

3.on host,use "free -g" to query,the memory used is also very high

4.when migrate or dormancy,it can recovery,but I want to know is there any way to trigger the host to reclaim virtual machine memory?
