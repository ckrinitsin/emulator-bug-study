additional = """This only occurs when wayland fractional scaling is enabled, not when text is scaled. Since GNOME/mutter accomplishes fractional scaling by upscaling, I think the VM is being told its window has a higher resolution than it actually has, so it is rendering the VM at a higher resolution, which is then displayed at the display's real resolution.

In the screenshot below, my resolution is 2256 x 1504 and I have set fractional scaling to 125%. It is worth noting (2256 / 1.25) / 3606 is approximately 0.5.

I apologize if the report is unsatisfactory. I will provide more detail if instructed. I tried reporting to GNOME Boxes and Virt-manager, which both use QEMU, but it seems the problem is upstream."""
