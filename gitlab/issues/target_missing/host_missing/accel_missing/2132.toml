description = """I wanted to give the Windows environment direct access to some of the physical USB ports on my pc. So I mapped a selection of ports to Windows via the associated hub. Windows correctly recognizes the hub. Also, when devices are plugged into or removed from the associated ports, Windows recognizes the connection of a new device or its removal. However, regardless of the device, Windows reports:
"USB device not recognized.
The last USB device you connected to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it.""""
reproduce = """1. Add one of the hosts USB hubs to a Windows VM as a USB Host Device.
2. Verify that Windows recognizes the host hub in device manager.
3. Try plugging in a USB device into one of the corresponding physical ports."""
