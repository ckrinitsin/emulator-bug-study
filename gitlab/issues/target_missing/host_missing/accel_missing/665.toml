    hw/block/nvme: support multiple namespaces

    This adds support for multiple namespaces by introducing a new 'nvme-ns'
    device model. The nvme device creates a bus named from the device name
    ('id'). The nvme-ns devices then connect to this and registers
    themselves with the nvme device.

    This changes how an nvme device is created. Example with two namespaces:

      -drive file=nvme0n1.img,if=none,id=disk1
      -drive file=nvme0n2.img,if=none,id=disk2
      -device nvme,serial=deadbeef,id=nvme0
      -device nvme-ns,drive=disk1,bus=nvme0,nsid=1
      -device nvme-ns,drive=disk2,bus=nvme0,nsid=2

    The drive property is kept on the nvme device to keep the change
    backward compatible, but the property is now optional. Specifying a
    drive for the nvme device will always create the namespace with nsid 1.

Using `-device nvme-ns` as shown above doesn't help either."""
