description = """Hello and thank you for your work on QEMU!

Using the NVMe driver with my Seagate FireCuda 530 2TB M.2 works fine until I encounter this problem, which is reliably reproducible for me.

When I suspend the guest and then suspend (s2idle) my host all is well until I resume the guest (manually with `virsh dompmwakeup $VMNAME`, after the host has resumed). Although the guest resumes and is interactive, it seems that anything involving filesystem operations hang forever and do not return.

Suspending and resuming the Linux guest seems to work perfectly if I don't suspend/resume the host.

Ultimately what I'm wanting to do is share the drive between VMs with qemu-storage-daemon. I can reproduce the problem in that scenario in much the same way. Using PCI passthrough with the same VM and device works fine and doesn't exhibit this problem.

Hopefully that's clear enough - let me know if there's anything else I can provide."""
reproduce = """1. Create a VM with a dedicated NVMe disk.
2. Boot an ISO and install to the disk.
3. Verify that suspend and resume works when not suspending the host.
4. Suspend the guest.
5. Suspend the host.
6. Wake the host.
7. Wake the guest.
8. Try just about anything that isn't likely already cached somewhere: `du -s /etc`."""
