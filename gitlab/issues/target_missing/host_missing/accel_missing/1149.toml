Would be nice to make it more generic, probably to call just `MAN_MICRON` and set octal mode like quad mode in other flash implementations - via the configuration register flags, especially since they could be enabled and disabled on the fly.

Also the 256 configuration registers: https://github.com/Xilinx/qemu/commit/9b2fe1e36bfd8849bb3538161279cdff6efea325
