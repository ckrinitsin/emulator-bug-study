If I outcomment the following lines in meson.build:
```
    #if get_option('wrap_mode') == 'nodownload'
    #  fdt_opt = 'system'
    #endif
```
Then the above command line works (with --disable-download)"""
additional = """The case is where one wants to ensure that configure does not try to access
network while doing its job. And in a system where dtc/libfdt is not available,
(or is too old, line in Centos/RHEL 7) one has dowloaded the files already in
subprojects/dtc/.

The meson.build clearly sets (as of 2024-03-05) expectation that dtc/libfdt/
has to come from 'system' if 'wrap_mode' is set to 'nodownload'.

Without this check it it works nicely -- and if subprojects/dtc/ was not populated,
the error message is 

```
Library fdt found: NO

../meson.build:3187:18: ERROR: Automatic wrap-based subproject downloading is disabled

A full log can be found at /home/too/vc/ext/qemu/build/meson-logs/meson-log.txt

ERROR: meson setup failed
```

So -- to me -- that looks like it could be a suitable solution to this problem."""
