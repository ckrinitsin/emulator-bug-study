The problem occurse when trying to run qemu from wsl. If I run qemu from a windows command line everything works as expected. 
If I run the os calling qemu (installed on windows) from wsl it fails with 

```

I also found an old bug report that seemed to be the same issue in the old issue tracker: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1893807"""
