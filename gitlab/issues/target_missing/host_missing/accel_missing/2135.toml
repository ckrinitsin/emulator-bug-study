description = """Could not boot MPS3-AN547 machine with images larger than 512KiB. 

I've tried to move part of the symbols to other memory area, but the memories were discontinuous and this resulted in a large image which covers the reserved area in-between and wouldn't boot. I'm looking for advice on how to put more code in bootram. 

I've also noticed the 8MB QSPI rom area, but AN547 does not have the remapping capability as AN524 and cannot use that as bootram. What is the best way to solve this?"""
