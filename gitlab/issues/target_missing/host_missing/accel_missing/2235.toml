description = """Hiren's Bootcd PE LiveCD not booting up in windows qemu.  
PE stands for pre-execution environment which is like a minimal boot environment like windows-recovery.  
The ram drive it makes is about 3.5 GiB.  
Being able to boot something like Hiren BootCD PE is like a simple test of qemu.   

I've tried many things, but I can't figure out if it's because I can't get the arguments right or if it is because of something else.
 
So far, using windows-qemu, I have not tried to boot a win10-guest-OS on win10 host-OS."""
reproduce = """1. Try to start qemu as per command. Try figure out what the right arguments/options are.

The live cd boot process is as follows
1. First the livecd bootloader loads files from the cdrom and unpacks them into a ramdrive
   During this phase, in the taskmgr it can be seen that the memory of the qemu process grows to about 1.5 GiB
2. Then the boot process should transfer to the unpacked OS in the ramdrive.  
   In the center of the screen, if one is doing efi-boot, then one can see the tianocore logo, else if one is doing legacy boot, then one can see the windows logo.  
   The windows loading animation, dots in circle, does not start. In some boot attempts, it seems to have put only 1 dot, in other boot attempts nothing at all.  
   Even after the expansion phase, the qemu process in the taskmgr shows a 11% use (which 1 cpu in a hyperthreading i7 quadcore cpu).  
   This means emulator is doing something. But, despite waiting for a long time, nothing seems to happen in the guest-display-window.
