additional = """The state of an output is controlled by the [enabled_output_bitmask](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/include/hw/virtio/virtio-gpu.h#L158) which is initialized to `1` at [device realization](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/hw/display/virtio-gpu-base.c#L204), thus VNC0 is always enabled.

Other devices will set this parameter during inititliazation by calling [dpy_set_ui_info](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/ui/console.c#L754) which schedules a call to [virtio_gpu_ui_info](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/hw/display/virtio-gpu-base.c#L89). However VNC calls this function only when handling [VNC_MSG_CLIENT_SET_DESKTOP_SIZE](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/ui/vnc.c#L2607) client command.\\
If the client does not support this command or never changes the size of the default window, the respective display will remain disabled."""
