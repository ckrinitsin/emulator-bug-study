additional = """Windows allows COM ports numbered 10 and higher to be prefixed with a `\\\\.\\` escape as in `\\\\.\\COM17`. Such COM port assignments are not uncommon when a plurality of USB serial adapters.
Equally problematic are virtual COM port designations such as `\\\\.\\CNCA8` created by the Windows 10x64 driver package known as `com0com`: https://pete.akeo.ie/2011/07/com0com-signed-drivers.html

Upon checking the source pulled from the Github mirror an initial fix was to simply modify /chardev/char.c, but this appears insufficient. Sadly.

Please ask if more information is required. I am actively working on extending an existing QEMU machine emulation. A patch to fix this problem is below. Please comment if applicable.
