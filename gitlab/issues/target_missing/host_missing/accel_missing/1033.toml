This is the same error as reported in bug 965109, but I'm running the most recent version of qemu - I built it from the git repo, so it should include the fix for 965109."""

additional = """- Not sure what other information I can provide to be helpful.
- The command line listed above is what I gather from ps; it's how qemu-arm-static is called by schroot. I've not been able to figure out _how_ schroot calls qemu-arm-static, I only know it does.
- I compiled qemu from source using my own user id, and ran into an issue with make install, so I manually used install to deploy the executable to /usr/local/bin... And then had to symlink that to /usr/bin as schroot apparently hardcodes the location of qemu-arm-static (at least it did not pick up the version I'd placed in /usr/local/bin)."""
