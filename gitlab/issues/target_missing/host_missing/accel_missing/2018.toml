> QEMU would not start when trying to create two UFS host controllers and a UFS logical unit for each with the following options:
> 
> -device ufs,id=bus0 \\
> -device ufs-lu,drive=drive1,bus=bus0,lun=0 \\
> -device ufs,id=bus1 \\
> -device ufs-lu,drive=drive2,bus=bus1,lun=0 \\
> 
> This is because the same ID string ("0:0:0/scsi-disk") is generated
> for both UFS logical units.
> 
> To fix this issue, prepend the parent pci device's path to make
> the ID string unique.
> ("0000:00:03.0/0:0:0/scsi-disk" and "0000:00:04.0/0:0:0/scsi-disk")"""
