Screen resolution is fixed by 800x600.
Driver is installed, but seems to have a problem (Attention sign. Warning, Error: digital signatur could not be checked -- at least there is no how to to make the existing signature work).
Latest available VirtIO-drivers where used as available from https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso 

Older available drivers did not work too as expected. Same problem. Could not check older Windows 10 versions, because of lack of older install media."""
