description = """Script "configure" uses "pkg-config" directly, at line 2420: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/f9f0e6173e1d570847930abfe2b4560c7b6a964a/configure#L2420

Because of it, GLIB_VERSION in "config-host.mak" can be taken from host system, under some circumstances (if PKG_CONFIG_PATH is not defined).

In case of cross-compilation, "**$pkg_config**" should be used instead of "pkg-config", to use pkg-config from cross-compilation toolchain and to take GLIB_VERSION of cross-compiled glib (as it is **correctly used at line 1476**: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/f9f0e6173e1d570847930abfe2b4560c7b6a964a/configure#L1476 )."""
reproduce = """1. Do not define PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable, use PKG_CONFIG variable instead.
2. Try to ./configure with cross-compiled glib.
3. GLIB_VERSION in config-host.mak will be from host glib."""

P.s. Sorry for posting the patch here, GitLab requires signing with a key to push the commit, it's too complicated to post 2-bytes fix."""
