description = """Before I installed the .exe from iso `virtio-win-0.1.271.iso`, I had value 5 in registry key `HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\QEMU Guest Agent VSS Provider\\VssOption`.
After the driver update by the .exe, the value was set to 1.

This registry key shouldn't change in driver update, as its value was manually set to 5 and it is important to preserve MSSQL backups in Proxmox.
