description = """Segmentation fault in the TCG thread.
The issue occurs in the generated code when branching to (helper)lookup_tb_ptr (see op longs).
It seems that the generated instruction don't load the upper32 of the address of lookup_tb_ptr in the register before branching to it. According to LLDB, the program tries to access 0x1cffe060 while the right address 0x7ff71cffe060 (see debugger logs)."""

`t2 = t1 & ~(0xffffUL << s1);`. 
The fix would be `t2 = t1 & ~(0xffffULL << s1);`
