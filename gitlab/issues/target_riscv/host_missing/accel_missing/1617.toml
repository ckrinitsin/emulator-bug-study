reproduce = """1. Enable IRQs globally (mstatus, vsstatus)
2. Set hstatus.VGEIN to a legal value
3. Write -1 to mie
4. Write -1 to hvip

I included a binary that should be able to reproduce the issue.

I use a vectored setup for mtvec and as soon as the VSEIP bit in hvip has been set the machine jumps to mtvec.vsei.
To confirm that I actually went to mtvec and not somewhere with a faulty print I also performed an ecall and that was reported as an M mode ecall."""
