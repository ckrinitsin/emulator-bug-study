description = """It looks as if some of the timer register offsets here are incorrect:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/hw/timer/ibex_timer.c?ref_type=heads#L37

Compare with:

https://opentitan.org/book/hw/ip/rv_timer/doc/registers.html

I suspect they're out of date. The documentation link on line 7 is not working anymore - the current documentation URL for Opentitan is the one just given.

It might also make sense to rename this file `opentitan_timer.c`, instead of  `ibex_timer.c`. The timer is an Opentitan hardware IP block, rather than a feature of the Ibex CPU."""
