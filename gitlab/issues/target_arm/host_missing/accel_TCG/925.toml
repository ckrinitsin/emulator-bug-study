additional = """A quick look at the implementation of the SVE2 load/store host memory access functions I've noticed that the `TLB_MMIO` flag is ignored in `sve_probe_page`, which means that users use the (null) host address as if it was pointing to real memory. This function (or the ones above it) should (probably) throw the appropriate external data abort, otherwise this needs to be instrumented to support reading from MMIO mapped devices.
