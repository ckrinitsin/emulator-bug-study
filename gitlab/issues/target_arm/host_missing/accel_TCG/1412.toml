description = """After upgrading to QEMU v7.2.0 from v7.1.0, when executing any SVE ldff1* instructions with a faulting address, QEMU crashes due to a null pointer dereference at target/arm/sve_helper.c:5364

I believe this was introduced in b8967ddf393aaf35fdbc07b4cb538a40f8b6fe37 (@rth7680), since in that commit `full` is dereferenced before the `flags & TLB_INVALID_MASK` check at line 5369, and full is set to null by `probe_access_full` when `TLB_INVALID_MASK` is given."""
