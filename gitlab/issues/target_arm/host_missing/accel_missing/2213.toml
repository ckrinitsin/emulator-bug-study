additional = """The problem does *not* occur if using modern virtio devices (which automatically happens for -M s390-ccw-virtio-2.7 and newer) or if using virtio-input devices with the same transport (e.g. two PCI devices instead of one PCI and one CCW).

Also note that the problem only occurs since QEMU 8.1 since older versions did not check for duplicate SaveStateEntries (see commit caa91b3c44cdb2d2921e25 )."""
