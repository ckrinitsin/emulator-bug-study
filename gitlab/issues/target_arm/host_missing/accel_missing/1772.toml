The current implementation in qemu behaves as though there are 16MPU regions when it really only has 8, as describes as `MPU_NS` and `MPU_S` core configuration parameters in the SSE-200's [Techincal Reference Manual](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101104/0200/functional-description/cpu-elements/cortex-m33-configurations?lang=en)."""

2. fix `boards/arm/mps2_an521/mps2_an521.dts` to set `arm,num-mpu-regions`  to the appropriate value of 8.
