This is a screenshot from QEMU 8.0.0, but updating to QEMU 8.2.0 does not resolve the problem.

I have discussed this with Lauterbach Trace32 support with these results:
- Trace32 uses RSP protocol `p` packets to read some registers, including SP_EL1. GDB seems to use `g` packet.
- QEMU responds to `p` packet with an invalid value, which causes Trace32 to display invalid value.

Some related RSP protocol logs from Trace32.

Different part of RSP protocol log:
```
Sending packet: $p20#d2 ...
receiving packet: ec00004000000000
```
So it looks like Trace32 can receive different values that zero as response to `p` packet."""
