description = """I have a windows vm executed via libvirt, I run it on a physical drive passing it into the guest. when I pass it via sata pt and try to install windows 11 on it, the install fails with error 0x80070001. I had an installation there which resulted with periodic bosd when sata pt was used.
if I pass the /dev node, I don't get the errors but the performance is horrible due to high hdd usage
I've tested the same setup with ubuntu, doing read and write to the device of multiple GB (200GB~), no issue at all.
I've opened an issue at virtio-win and it was closed claiming it is a sata pt issue after trying latest virtio-win."""
