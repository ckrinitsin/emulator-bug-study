description = """Since qemu 8.2, using TCG acceleration in combination with EDK2-OVMF UEFI Secure Boot firmware hangs on boot. qemu freezes and keeps a full CPU core busy at 100% while it hangs. The issue does not occur when using KVM acceleration. It also does not occur when not using EDK2-OVMF UEFI firmware. It also does not occur when using the non secure boot EDK2-OVMF UEFI firmware."""
