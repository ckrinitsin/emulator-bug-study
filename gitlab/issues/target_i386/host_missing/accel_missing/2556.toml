description = """When reducing the memory using ballooning, the shutdown takes very long. One may even assume it crashed, but it will eventually power off."""
reproduce = """1. wait until Windows has booted
2. reduce the balloon by multiple GB via monitor: `balloon 8192` _(8 GB balloon, memory size is 24 GB)_
3. Shut down (or reboot) Windows

The system shows the boot screen at shutdown for a long time.

It's about 10 seconds extra time per reduced balloon size. So when resizing the balloon from 24 GB to 8 GB, that's 16 GB.  
So the shutdown needs: 16 * 10 = 160 seconds = **about 3 minutes**"""
