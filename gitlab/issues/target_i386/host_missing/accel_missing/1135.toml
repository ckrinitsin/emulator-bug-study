description = """Breakpoint at 0x85d4, this is the entrypoint of this Multiboot loader.
According to the Multiboot specification, the EAX register should be a pointer to the Multiboot information block. When I am testing, it is 0x9500. However, when dumping the memory using `dump binary memory`, nearby memory areas are all zeros.

When dumping some bigger memory aeras, I found that the module hasbeen loaded to the memory successfully, altough MBI was broken."""
