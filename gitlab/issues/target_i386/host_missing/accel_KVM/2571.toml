    i386: Add support for SUCCOR feature
    
    Add cpuid bit definition for the SUCCOR feature. This cpuid bit is required to
    be exposed to guests to allow them to handle machine check exceptions on AMD
    hosts.
```
Everything still seems to work so possibly not a bug. But the errors are still very disconcerting. Any thoughts?"""
