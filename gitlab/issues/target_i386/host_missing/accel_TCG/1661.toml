description = """The Geode LX family of CPUs were used in early generations of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) systems (XO 1.0).

They are _basically_ i686-compatible but they lack the 'long-nop' (0x0f 0x1f) instruction available on many other i686-class devices.

Since i686 is a reasonably common baseline for toolchains and the software that is distributed using those toolchains, it would be convenient to be able to use QEMU to test boundary compatibility cases for this CPU."""
