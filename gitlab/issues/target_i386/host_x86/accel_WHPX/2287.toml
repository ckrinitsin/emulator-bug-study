   With all guestos-win98-drivers installed the win98 seems to work satisfactorily.  
   Using vga driver from https://github.com/JHRobotics/vmdisp9x/releases   
2. now change processor to ```-cpu core2duo```, it boots . This does not seem to matter, bug exists even with qemu64
3. now change accel to ```-machine type=pc,accel=whpx ```, qemu crashes partway into boot before bringing up desktop.   
   with or without ```kernel-irqchip=off``` does not matter   
   with or without cpu arguments ```,hv-relaxed,hv-vapic,hv-spinlocks=0x1fff,hv-time``` also does not matter
4. Setting back to ```-machine type=pc,accel=tcg -cpu core2duo``` restores bootable win98se."""

- The part of the OS bootsequence, which includes the Win98/DOS boot menu, scandisk, etc. works fine. Its possible to boot to DOS mode and run DOS commands. The crash happens when into the win.com Win98SE boot sequence just before it can bring up the GUI desktop.  
- qemu crashes even if in the win98/DOS bootmenu, selection is made to boot into ```safe-mode```, which is supposed to boot a vanilla 16-color VGA desktop loading minimal drivers. As before, crash happens before GUI desktop is loaded.
