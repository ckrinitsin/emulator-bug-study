description = """Since the update there is a massive CPU load and this affects the CPU load of the router.
The VMs are partially for about 3min sporadically not accessible.
The VMs themselves were not adjusted and I have in the console.

Using the VMM, I was able to see the message recorded below.

`watchdog:_ BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 21s! [swapper/0:0]`

I will also add some data like a XML file of a VM."""

Unfortunately I can't revert to the old QEMU version in the router OS but in the current state all my VM are not really 100% usable anymore.

I would be very grateful if you could take a look at my case.

many thanks in advance.
