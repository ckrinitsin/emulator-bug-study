from my email  to qemu-ppc list:

SPR 304 was already in target/ppc/cpu_init.c

but sadly after adding those it still dies early :(

I looked at

IBM PowerPC 970FX RISC Microprocessor 11.6 SCOM Facility

but whole thing a bit more complex than pair of regs.

====

11.6.1 Processor Core SCOM SPR Access Each processor (core) has two special purpose registers (SPRs) used to access the SCOM interface: SCOMC and SCOMD. SCOMC and SCOMD are both 64-bit read/write SPRs and are used for SCOM Control and SCOM Data respectively. The interface is implemented as a direct connection to the parallel-to-serial converter, which handles the arbitration between the core and service processor. 

11.6.2 Operating System Protocol to Access SCOM SPRs In the PowerPC 970FX, SCOMC and SCOMD are complete operations. They do not require a software protocol in order to function properly except to disable external (asynchronous) interrupts. Software must check the error bits after performing an SCOMC to ensure that the command successfully completed. Table 11-14 Operating System Code to Access SCOM outlines a general software protocol for using these registers.
