description = """When debugging in MacsBug, tracing/stepping over any branches (e.g. blt, bgt) will land on the instruction immediately passed the expected address. It appears that branches will execute the target instruction then single step to the next instruction in one go, instead of single stepping to the target instruction.

For example, if a blt should land on 13371234, stepping over the branch will land on 13371238. The instruction at 13371234 still executes, but this is not the behaviour on a baremetal Mac OS system."""
