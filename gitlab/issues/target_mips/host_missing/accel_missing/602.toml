description = """In translated IP_RECVERR (and IPV6_RECVERR) control messages, the `ee_errno` is not translated, so host errnos are observed on guests.  E.g., `ECONNREFUSED` is 111 on x86_64 host, but expected to be 146 in MIPS ABI."""

The fix is something like:

```
__put_user(host_to_target_errno(errh->ee.ee_errno), &target_errh->ee.ee_errno);
