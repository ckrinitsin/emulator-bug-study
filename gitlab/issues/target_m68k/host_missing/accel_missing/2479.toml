If this procedure is done with an older version of gdbserver (such as 7.12) then I can connect normally. However, if a breakpoint is placed anywhere in the program and if it is reached at any point during execution and if after it is reached the 'continue' command is entered, then the error message below is displayed by the gdbserver:

```
linux-low.c:2627: A problem internal to GDBserver has been detected.
int maybe_hw_step(thread_info*): Assertion `has_reinsert_breakpoints (thread)' failed.

I think it's working on real hardware."""
