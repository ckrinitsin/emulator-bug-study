description = """If interrupt is raised after instruction that can skip following instruction (for example `CPSE`), and skip condition is active, instead of correct vector, one after it is executed. 

This can happen only if CPSE instruction is at the end of translation block. Usually it is somewhere inside block and very rare arrangement of code is required to get into that error."""
reproduce = """Real world scenario is waiting in busy loop for `std::atomic<bool>` set by interrupt, in bigger application, with optimized code and rare chance of code arrangement. Effect usually is landing in `__bad_interrupt` and reset, but can also be executing other interrupt handler.

Synthetic example is:

1. There must be instruction that can skip following instruction (for example `CPSE`), with always-active condition for skip
2. It must be placed in way, that it will be at the end of translation block.

\tExample (addresses matter):
```
     ff8:\t81 e0       \tldi\tr24, 0x01\t; 1
     ffa:\t88 13       \tcpse\tr24, r24
     ffc:\t01 c0       \trjmp\t.+2      \t; 0x1000
     ffe:\t80 e0       \tldi\tr24, 0x00\t; 0
    1000:\t00 00       \tnop
```

3. It should be busy-looped to raise chances of encountering that code
4. Any external interrupt should be generated
\t- the simplest is UART RX on stdin raised by key presses

Fully working example attached, with ELF file, annotated C code, ASM dump, and Makefile that allows compiling and running this scenario (but I don't guarantee that self-compiling would always generate this error - it can move code a bit). 

(please adjust paths to GCC and QEMU in Makefile before using)

[avr-irq-fail.zip](/uploads/b702104098a31754d544d6ae6e60e074/avr-irq-fail.zip)

Running by command:

    ./qemu-system-avr -machine arduino-uno -nographic -monitor null -serial stdio -bios fail.elf

And then press any key until error happens.

It is largely machine independent, I originally encountered that on custom Atmega644 machine."""
