qemu got sigabrt when using vpp in guest and dpdk for qemu
Description of problem:
When set the interface up in vpp, the qemu process is crashed with signal sigabrt. 

After some debug, i have identified that the problem lies in the following function.

```c
static int setup_routing_entry(struct kvm *kvm,
			       struct kvm_irq_routing_table *rt,
			       struct kvm_kernel_irq_routing_entry *e,
			       const struct kvm_irq_routing_entry *ue)
{
	struct kvm_kernel_irq_routing_entry *ei;
	int r;
	u32 gsi = array_index_nospec(ue->gsi, KVM_MAX_IRQ_ROUTES);

	/*
	 * Do not allow GSI to be mapped to the same irqchip more than once.
	 * Allow only one to one mapping between GSI and non-irqchip routing.
	 */
	hlist_for_each_entry(ei, &rt->map[gsi], link)
		if (ei->type != KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP ||
		    ue->type != KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP ||
		    ue->u.irqchip.irqchip == ei->irqchip.irqchip)
			return -EINVAL;

```

I added some debug printk like following

```c
        hlist_for_each_entry(ei, &rt->map[gsi], link)
                if (ei->type != KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP ||
                    ue->type != KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP ||
                    ue->u.irqchip.irqchip == ei->irqchip.irqchip){
                        printk("ei->type: %u, KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP: %u, ue->type: %u, ue->u.irqchip.irqchip: %u , ei->irqchip.irqchip: %u",  ei->type, KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP , ue->type, ue->u.irqchip.irqchip , ei->irqchip.irqchip);
                        return -EINVAL;
        }
```

Then i got following in dmesg

```
[Thu Nov 23 09:29:10 2023] ei->type: 2, KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP: 1, ue->type: 1, ue->u.irqchip.irqchip: 2 , ei->irqchip.irqchip: 4276097024
[Thu Nov 23 09:29:10 2023] ei->type: 2, KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP: 1, ue->type: 1, ue->u.irqchip.irqchip: 2 , ei->irqchip.irqchip: 4276097024
```
Steps to reproduce:
This is a kube-ovn + dpdk env, not easy to reproduce now..
