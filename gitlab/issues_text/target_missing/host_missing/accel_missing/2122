qemu-user-static segfault running ldconfig on host x86_64 with client arm64
Description of problem:
qemu segfault
Steps to reproduce:
1. download ubuntu jammy arm64 rootfs (I assume any will do)
2. mount it (with /proc from host so apt is happy)
3. execute an apt uninstall that triggers libc-bin processing
