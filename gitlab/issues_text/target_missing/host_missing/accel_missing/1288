GPU passing through guest crashes
Description of problem:
First and foremost, I don't know if this is a QEMU, KVM or GPU driver issue.
I began emailing libvirt project and they advised me to contact you, then KVM and then GPU driver developer(NVIDIA).
Host is crashing from time to time. I have guest's kernel dumps(~2GB each).
Steps to reproduce:
Unfortunately, I don't have steps to reproduce.
Additional information:
I'm aware I'm not running the latest qmeu version but I'm willing to install developer version and try to reproduce or test patch if developer requires it.
