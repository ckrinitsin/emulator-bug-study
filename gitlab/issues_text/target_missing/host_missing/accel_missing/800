Cannot write to MTP Devices in Qemu 6.0.0+
Description of problem:
QEMU versions above 6.0.0 are no longer able to write to MTP devices, the kernel prints a warning which is unique to versions above 6.0.0:
```
usb-mtp: file monitoring init failed: File monitoring not available on this platform is just warning
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch a QEMU virtual machine with `-usb -device usb-mtp,rootdir=/tmp,readonly=false` using any QEMU version above 6.0.0
2. Mount the MTP device using something:
   ```
   mkdir mtpDevice && jmtpfs mtpDevice
   ```
3. Try to write to the mtp device:
   ```
   touch mtpDevice/test
   ```
4. Observe that you will get an input/output error when trying to write to the device, like this:
   ```
   vm-test-run-mtp> client: must succeed: /nix/store/xmib7222ybr72iyycra4w386s8p1k4av-jmtpfsTest.sh >&2
   vm-test-run-mtp> client # Device 0 (VID=46f4 and PID=0004) is a QEMU Virtual MTP.
   vm-test-run-mtp> client # qemu-system-x86_64: usb-mtp: file monitoring init failed: File monitoring not available on this platform
   vm-test-run-mtp> client # /nix/store/xmib7222ybr72iyycra4w386s8p1k4av-jmtpfsTest.sh: line 4: phone/tmp/testFile: Input/output error
   ```
