Network failed in qemu-7.2.0
Description of problem:
After I created and installed Ubuntu 20.04 img in qemu virtual machine from Ubuntu 20.04 iso, I found that the network could not work normally, the network settings wasn't right yet.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download the source code of qemu-7.2.0 using command "wget https://download.qemu.org/qemu-7.2.0.tar.xz";
2. Untar using command "tar Jxvf qemu-7.2.0.tar.xz";
3. Configure with command "./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu" under root of qemu source code;
4. Build with command "make";
5. Install with command "make install" or "sudo make install";
5. Create image with command "qemu-img create -f qcow2 Ubuntu2004.img 40G";
5. Launch and install guest with ubuntu 20.04 iso using command "qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 8G -smp 4 -boot once=d -cdrom ../iso_images/Ubuntu-20.04.5-desktop-amd.iso -drive file=./Ubuntu2004.img -device ac97";
6. After system installed, launch guest with command "qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 8G -smp 4 -drive file=./Ubuntu2004.img -device ac97"
Additional information:
1. When I used qemu version 7.1.0, that is qemu-7.1.0, and go through the same steps above, then the network worked normally, and the network setting was right.
2. Windows images from Windows iso(s) had the same phenomenon.
