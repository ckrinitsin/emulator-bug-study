video memory option not working with Mac OS or Windows guest
Description of problem:
The vgamem_mb option tells the guest how much video memory it has access to. When I used this command '-device VGA,vgamem_mb=128', I expect the guest to report there is 128 MB of video memory. What actually happens is the guest does not seem to know how much video memory is actually available.
Steps to reproduce:
**Mac OS guest:**
1. Run a Mac OS guest with this command: -device VGA,vgamem_mb=128
2. In Mac OS X open the System Information application -> /Applications/Utilities/System Information. 
3. Click on "Graphics/Displays".
4. Look at the 'VRAM (Total)' field.
The field only shows 3 MB of video ram.

**Windows guest:**
1. Run a Windows (Windows XP in my case) guest with this command: -device VGA,vgamem_mb=128
2. Click on Start->Run.
3. Enter 'dxdiag'.
4. Push the OK button.
5. Click on the Display tap in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.
6. Look at the Approv. Total Memory field.
The field should say 128 MB but actually says N/A.
