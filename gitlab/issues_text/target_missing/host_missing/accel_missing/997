Iothread is stuck at 100% CPU usage with virtio-scsi on QEMU 7.0.0
Description of problem:
Starting with QEMU 7.0.0, the iothread associated attached to a virtio-scsi controller is stuck at 100% CPU usage. Bisected to: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/826cc32423db2a99d184dbf4f507c737d7e7a4ae

- Works as expected without the iothread
- No issue with virtio-blk + iothread
- Same behavior regardless of io=threads/native/io_uring
- Same behavior with default vs increased queue count
- The issue is triggered when the guest OS initializes the virtio driver
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add virtio-scsi controller with iothread
2. Boot VM
3. Check per-thread CPU usage such as in htop
