Passing `-M microvm` and `-smbios type=11...` results in smbios args being silently dropped
Description of problem:
(reporting as requested by `danpb` on IRC)

Using the `-machine microvm` flag with the `smbios type=11...` argument results in the smbios options being silently discarded, because the microvm target doesn't seem to support the smbios feature.

danpb on IRC suggested that passing those two incompatible flags should result in an error.
