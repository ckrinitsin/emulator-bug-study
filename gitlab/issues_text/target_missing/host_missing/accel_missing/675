Attaching WinDbg to a Windows guest on Windows host causes hang
Description of problem:
Attempting to attach WinDbg to a Windows guest on a Windows host causes qemu to lockup while using real serial ports. This has been an issue for some time (years if I'm remembering correctly) I just haven't reported it.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Enable debug in Windows guest
2. Create a DB9 between 2 COM ports
3. Power guest
4. Attach WinDbg to 2nd COM port not in use by the guest
