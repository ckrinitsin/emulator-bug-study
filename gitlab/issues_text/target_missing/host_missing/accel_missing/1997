Disk corruption on ARM64 (Apple Silicon) Linux VMs
Description of problem:
aarch64 Linux VMs will encounter disk corruption if they're set up with a filesystem that will notice it when it happens, e.g. BTRFS.  This seems to be across the board with products, including Apple Hypervisor Framework, or just QEMU, so it very well might be an aarch64 Linux bug.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install an aarch64 Linux VM using BTRFS as the root filesystem.  ZFS might recognize silent corruption readily as well.
2. Run `stress-ng --iomix 4`
3. Check your `dmesg` and/or `btrfs check --force <device>` to check for filesystem corruption.
Additional information:
This is discussed in two other tickets, but I'm hoping to get more attention to the problem here.

I can't seem to figure out how to upload images, but you can probably get to the image that I'm trying to share somehow...
