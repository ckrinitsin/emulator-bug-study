qemu have  the way to change the windows sid?
Description of problem:
I want to change the guest of windows sid after clone guest, have  the way to change it before new guest start? "virt-sysprep" Seems impossible to do it. Although it can be done manually as follow:

[change sid in windows system](https://www.heelpbook.net/2019/microsoft-changing-sid-of-cloned-vms/)

query windows sid:
cmd: whoami /user


step:
1.clone a new windows guest vm_new

2.change the sid of vm_new  (step2 I don't know how to do that)

3.start vm_new

4.query the vm_new's sid is change
