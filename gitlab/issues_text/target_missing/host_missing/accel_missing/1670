Cannot statically build x86_64-softmmu with Darwin(Intel)
Description of problem:
I am using `Podman` and currently,`Podman` uses qemu on macOS. The `Podman` team has adopted a scheme to dynamically compile `qemu` (https://github.com/containers/podman-machine-qemu). However, I am currently trying to use static compilation for both amd64 and arm64 targets.

I have searched many articles online, most of which are about static compilation on Linux. Very few articles mention static compilation on macOS, and some mention that `softmmu` does not support static compilation. However, I have not found any concrete evidence to support this claim.

I also want to ask another question: Does `qemu` support static compilation on macOS?
