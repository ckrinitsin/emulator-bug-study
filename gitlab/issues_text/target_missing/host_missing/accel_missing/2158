Qemu will not release mouse even after using the release mouse keybind
Description of problem:
There wasn't a crash but this is an annoying problem. The mouse does not release when the VM sizes the window larger because, as far as I know, qemu moves the window and relies on the user to click to release the mouse.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open qemu 
2. Try to release the mouse using the keybind shown.
3. It move the window and won't release.
Additional information:
In case it's really needed, I am using a custom QEMU VM Manager called "QEMU Manager".
