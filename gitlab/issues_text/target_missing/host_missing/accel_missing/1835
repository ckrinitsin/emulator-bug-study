IPv4 guest/outbound port forwarding not working
Description of problem:
Python http server running on the host can receive the first http request from guest and provides correct response, but the resent request gets stuck. Package couldn't be seen in `tcpdump` running on host.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Build libslirp, I am using HEAD @ master.
1. Build your QEMU with user network enabled to use slirp (`./configure -target-list=x86_64-softmmu --enable-slirp`).
1. Ran a Python server on host listening to port `6655` (`python3 -m http.server --bind :: 6655`).
1. Boot your QEMU with aforementioned QEMU command line, I am forwarding a server address to host's local address `guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.100:6657-tcp:127.0.0.1:6655`. For image, I am using a ordinary Fedora 38 workstation live cdrom.
1. In your guest OS (emulated enviroment), open a terminal and run `curl http://10.0.2.100:6657`, this sends a http get to the 
slirp outbound forwarding server. You should see the Python http server gets the request and provides correct response `::ffff:127.0.0.1 - - [17/Aug/2023 18:24:34] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -`, nothing but just `ls` the directory.
5. Repeat step 4, you will see the `curl` command gets stuck.
Additional information:
I've added a .pacp capturing line in QEMU command line and investigated it via Wireshark, noticed the slirp gets the http get, but after that being stuck in some place, I saw the guest sending keep alive request to slirp, so I think this could be something in the QEMU side.
