Trying to use EGA or VGA functions from QBASIC doesn't work
Description of problem:
QBASIC can't start any graphics mode beyond CGA

Some other programs that default to EGA crash trying to start graphics; none that I've tried can start EGA at all; believe to be the same bug; will file separately if it turns out to not be
Steps to reproduce:
1. Boot
2. Start QBASIC
3. Run a program consisting of only "SCREEN 12" for VGA or "SCREEN 9" for EGA
4. Get error message "Illegal Function Call"
