WerFault.exe – Application Error. The memory could not be read in Win7 i386
Description of problem:
WerFault Application Errors always occur when I open IE or even control panel. It's OK on QEMU 7.2 & 8.0 version according to my debug experience about qemu-system-i386 flavor in the last few months.
Steps to reproduce:
1. pulling _tag: v8.2.0_ code 
2. emulating Windows 7 OS on aarch64 Host with TCG acceleration mechanism
3. just opening IE for maybe two or three times after the virtual machine has started
Additional information:
The error is displayed by Chinese. It says _WerFault.exe – Application Error. The instruction at 0x779f77b2 referenced memory at 0x6d0f6d20. The memory could not be read._ in English
