x86 BLSI and BLSR semantic bug
Description of problem:
The result of instruction BLSI and BLSR is different from the CPU. The value of CF is different.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile this code
```
void main() {
    asm("blsi rax, rbx");
}
```
2. Execute and compare the result with the CPU. The value of `CF` is exactly the opposite. This problem happens with BLSR, too.
