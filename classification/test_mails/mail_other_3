This fix is fine for me...at least from SDM, HTT depends on topology and
it should exist when user sets "-smp 4".

I haven't found any other thread :-).

By the way, just curious, in what cases do you need to disbale the HT
flag? "-smp 4" means 4 cores with 1 thread per core, and is it not
enough?

As for the “-ht” behavior, I'm also unsure whether this should be fixed
or not - one possible consideration is whether “-ht” would be useful.
