Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is running an ARM binary with QEMU and getting an illegal instruction error, but when debugging with GDB, it exits normally. The ELF file is for ARM, so QEMU is emulating the ARM CPU.

First, the error message "uncaught target signal 4 (Illegal instruction)" suggests that the CPU is trying to execute an instruction it doesn't recognize or isn't allowed. But when using GDB remote debugging, it works. That's odd. Why would debugging change the behavior?

Possible reasons: maybe the binary uses some CPU features that aren't properly emulated in QEMU 4.0.0. For example, certain ARM instructions or coprocessor operations. If the binary is using a VFP (Vector Floating Point) instruction but QEMU's emulation for that is missing or broken in version 4.0.0, that could cause an illegal instruction. However, the user mentioned the Flags in the ELF include soft-float ABI, so maybe the binary is supposed to use software floating point instead of hardware. If QEMU's ARM emulator is trying to handle VFP instructions but the binary isn't expecting it, maybe that's a conflict.

Wait, the Flags field says "Version5 EABI, soft-float ABI". ARM EABI with soft-float means the code shouldn't use VFP instructions. If the binary is compiled with soft-float, but QEMU is trying to execute VFP instructions, that would be invalid. But why would that happen? Maybe the binary has some code that's supposed to be handled by the soft-float emulator, but QEMU's emulation isn't handling that correctly. Or perhaps there's a mismatch in how QEMU is translating the instructions.

Another angle: when running under GDB, the execution is single-stepped or handled differently. Maybe the illegal instruction is triggered only when running normally, but under GDB, the program might be exiting before hitting that instruction. Or GDB might be intercepting the signal and allowing the program to exit normally. For example, if the program has a bug where it jumps to an invalid address, but during debugging, the GDB might catch that and handle it, whereas QEMU without GDB would crash.

But the user says that when remote debugging with GDB, the program exited normally. That suggests that the illegal instruction isn't present when GDB is attached. How could that be? Maybe the presence of GDB changes the execution path. For example, maybe the program checks if it's being debugged and skips the problematic code. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe QEMU's just-in-time compiler (TCG) has a bug in version 4.0.0 when handling certain ARM instructions, leading to an illegal instruction. When running under GDB, perhaps the execution is done via the interpreter mode instead of TCG, avoiding the bug. But QEMU typically uses TCG for emulation, and GDB would step through the translated code. Hmm.

Another thought: the binary might be using a specific instruction that's not supported in QEMU 4.0.0's ARM emulation. For example, a newer ARM instruction that wasn't emulated correctly in that version. If the user's QEMU is outdated, maybe upgrading would fix it. But the user is asking about classifying the bug, not solving it.

The problem seems to be related to the execution of an instruction that QEMU can't handle, hence the illegal instruction error. Since the same binary works under GDB, maybe the way QEMU is emulating the CPU is different. But the core issue is an illegal instruction, which points to an instruction-related problem. The category options are instruction, syscall, or runtime. Since it's about an illegal instruction during execution, the category is "instruction".
