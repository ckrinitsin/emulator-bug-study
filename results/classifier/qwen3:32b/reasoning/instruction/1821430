Okay, let's see. The user is reporting that qemu-user-arm version 4.0.0-rc0 is crashing with a SIGILL on certain instructions. They provided two examples where the illegal instruction is related to VFP (like vseleq.f64 and vrintm.f64). The same binaries work with version 3.1.0, so this is a regression.

The key here is that the problem is happening because QEMU is encountering an illegal instruction when running the ARM binary. The user is using QEMU for cross-compilation, specifically with a wrapper. The error messages from GDB show that the PC (program counter) is pointing to these VFP instructions, which QEMU might not be emulating correctly in the newer version. 

Since the issue is directly related to the execution of specific ARM instructions (VFP instructions in this case) and QEMU's handling of them, this falls under the 'instruction' category. The problem isn't with a system call (syscall) or some other runtime error like memory issues, but specifically with how QEMU emulates certain instructions. The fact that it's a regression suggests that there's a bug in the instruction emulation code in QEMU 4.0.0-rc0 compared to the previous version. 

Therefore, the correct category for this bug report is 'instruction'.
