Okay, let's see. The user is having an issue where qemu-x86_64 crashes with an "Illegal Instruction" error when running SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks, specifically Perlbench. They provided some logs from using the -d in_asm flag.

Looking at the additional information, the crash happens after executing a series of x86_64 instructions. The key line is the "qemu: uncaught target signal 4 (Illegal instruction) - core dumped". Signal 4 is SIGILL, which is indeed related to an illegal instruction. The instructions listed before the crash include standard x86-64 operations like movq and jmp. The last instruction before the crash is "62 .byte 0x62". Wait, 0x62 is the hex value for 'b' in ASCII. That's odd because 0x62 isn't a valid x86 instruction. That byte might be part of some data or maybe an error in the binary.

But why is QEMU encountering an illegal instruction here? The user is running compiled SPEC benchmarks, so maybe the code generated by the compiler includes an invalid instruction. However, the problem occurs under QEMU but not on native hardware? Or perhaps QEMU is misconfiguring or missing support for certain instructions. Wait, the user is running on different machines, but two out of three still crash. So maybe the issue isn't the host machine's CPU but QEMU itself. If the compiled Perlbench includes instructions that QEMU can't emulate, that would cause an illegal instruction. For example, if the code uses AVX or some other extension not properly handled by QEMU's emulation, but in this case, the instruction is just 0x62, which isn't a standard instruction. 

Another angle: the binary might be corrupted or compiled with incorrect flags. However, the user says they compiled it as a basic Perlbench binary, but maybe the compiler optimization flags are causing issues. But the problem is consistent across different machines, suggesting the issue is in QEMU's handling of the instruction. Alternatively, the user might be running a 32-bit binary on a QEMU that's expecting 64-bit, but the error is about an illegal instruction, not a segmentation fault or something else. 

The key here is the presence of an invalid instruction (0x62) that QEMU doesn't recognize. So this would fall under the 'instruction' category because the problem is that QEMU is encountering an instruction it can't execute, leading to a crash. The 'instruction' category is for when the bug is due to a faulty instruction being processed by QEMU. The 'runtime' category is for other runtime errors, and 'syscall' is for system call issues. Since the error is directly about an illegal instruction, the correct category is 'instruction'.
