Okay, let's tackle this bug report classification. The user is saying that QEMU 3.0.0 doesn't support the lxvwsx instruction for POWER9, leading to an illegal instruction error. They mention that when they work around it by using two separate instructions, everything works.

First, I need to figure out which category this falls into: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The problem is specifically about an instruction not being supported. The lxvwsx is a PowerPC vector instruction. QEMU's emulator for the CPU should handle these instructions. Since the issue is that the instruction isn't implemented, causing a crash, that's an instruction-level problem. The user even checked with objdump and saw the instruction is present in the binary. So QEMU's emulation of that particular instruction is missing. 

Syscall would be if there was an issue with system calls, like incorrect handling of open(), read(), etc. Runtime errors could be things like memory management issues, threading problems, etc., but here it's a specific instruction not being emulated. Therefore, the category should be "instruction".
