Okay, I need to figure out what category this bug report falls into. The options are instruction, syscall, or runtime. Let me read through the problem description again.

The issue is about QEMU binaries on macOS not having an embedded property list (plist). The user explains that macOS apps usually use an Info.plist file inside the app bundle, but for command line tools, you can embed it using the linker with the -sectcreate option. The problem is that without this embedded plist, certain system features won't work correctly, like the bundle identifier. The solution is to create a plist file and tell the linker to embed it.

So, the bug is that the QEMU binaries are missing this embedded plist. The user is suggesting that the build process for QEMU isn't including this step. The categories given are instruction, syscall, or runtime. 

An instruction error would be if there's a mistake in how the code is written or compiled. A syscall error is about system calls failing. Runtime errors occur during execution. 

In this case, the problem is during the linking phase. The linker isn't being instructed to include the plist file. The issue is in the build process, specifically the linking command. So, the error is in the way the executable is being built, not in the code's runtime behavior or system calls. Therefore, this seems like an instruction issue because the correct linker flag isn't being used. The category should be "instruction".
