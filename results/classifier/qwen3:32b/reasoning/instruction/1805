Okay, let's see. The user is talking about a CI job in QEMU called build-user-hexagon that's not actually testing the Hexagon architecture. The problem seems to be with the compiler that's being used. From the logs, the C compiler is reported as 'cc' which is GCC 10.2.1, but they expected a Hexagon cross-compiler.

Looking into the Dockerfile for the hexagon-cross container, they installed a toolchain under /opt and added it to the PATH. However, the toolchain only has 'clang' and not 'cc'. The issue here is that when the configure script looks for 'cc', it's finding the native x86_64 GCC instead of the cross-compiler. The user tried setting CC=clang but Meson then assumes it's a native compiler, leading to an error because it can't run the compiled binaries.

The root cause seems to be that the Hexagon container isn't set up correctly compared to other cross-compiler containers. The toolchain binaries aren't named with the target triplet (like hexagon-unknown-linux-musl-clang), which is necessary for cross-compilation. Previously, this was done, but a commit switched to a pre-built toolchain without maintaining that naming. Also, the environment variable QEMU_CONFIGURE_OPTS isn't set with the cross-prefix, which is needed to tell the build system to use the cross-compiler.

The user is pointing out that the CI job isn't actually building for Hexagon because the setup is incorrect. The main problem is the misconfiguration in the toolchain setup within the Docker container. Since this is about the setup of the build environment and the correct tools being used during the configuration and build process, it's not an error during runtime or a syscall issue. It's about the instructions or setup steps that are incorrect in the CI job.

So the category here should be 'instruction' because the bug report is about a faulty instruction in setting up the cross-compiler environment for Hexagon in the CI job. The problem arises from how the toolchain is installed and referenced in the Dockerfile, leading to the wrong compiler being used during the build process.
