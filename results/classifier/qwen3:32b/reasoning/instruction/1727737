Okay, let's see. The user is reporting that a GCC sanitizer test stalls when run under QEMU starting from version 2.8, whereas it worked in 2.7. The key part here is that the problem began with QEMU 2.8 and onwards, and they provided a test case that works in 2.7 but not in later versions.

The user mentioned using qemu-arm and provided a disassembly line where it stalls: 0x40b6eb44: e08f4004 add r4, pc, r4. The instruction here is an ARM ADD instruction. The question is to classify this bug into one of the categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime.

Looking at the problem, the test stalls at a specific instruction. The fact that it works in 2.7 but not in 2.8 suggests that there might be a change in how that particular instruction is emulated in QEMU. The instruction in question is an ARM add instruction where the PC (program counter) is used as an operand. In ARM architecture, when using PC in data processing instructions, it refers to the address of the current instruction plus 8 (since ARM instructions are 32-bit and the PC is two instructions ahead). If QEMU's emulation of this instruction is incorrect, it could lead to the program stalling or incorrect execution.

The stall is happening during the execution of a specific instruction, which points to an issue with the instruction emulation. Since the problem is tied to a specific version change (2.7 to 2.8), it's likely that a change in the ARM instruction handling was introduced. The user's use of "-d in_asm" shows that the problem is at the instruction level. Therefore, the classification should be "instruction".
