Okay, let's see. The user is reporting that AVX/AVX2 isn't correctly detected in user mode. The categories are instruction, syscall, or runtime.

First, AVX and AVX2 are instruction sets. So if the issue is about not detecting these instructions properly, it's probably related to the instructions themselves. The problem is in user mode, which might relate to how the emulator handles those instructions. Since the category 'instruction' is for a faulty instruction described in the report, this seems like it fits. The detection issue would be due to incorrect handling of the AVX/AVX2 instructions. It's not a syscall error, and runtime is for other runtime errors. So the answer should be instruction.
