Okay, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user provided several code examples that compile with gcc and run on a real machine, but when run under QEMU using qemu-x86_64, they cause an illegal instruction error. 

First, I need to understand why QEMU is reporting an illegal instruction. The code uses inline assembly with instructions like psignb, psignd, psignw, etc. These are part of the SSE instruction set, maybe? Wait, psign is part of SSE3, if I recall correctly. So if QEMU's emulator doesn't support those specific instructions, it would throw an illegal instruction error. 

The user's QEMU version is 2.7.0. Maybe that version of QEMU doesn't emulate certain CPU instructions that are required for these operations. The real machine can execute them because the actual CPU supports them, but QEMU's emulation is missing those instructions.

Looking at the categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Since the problem is that QEMU doesn't recognize or handle specific CPU instructions correctly, this seems like an instruction-related issue. The illegal instruction is being caught by QEMU because it can't emulate that particular instruction. The other possibility is a runtime error, but runtime usually refers to things like memory issues or program flow errors. Since the error is about an instruction not being recognized, the category should be "instruction".
