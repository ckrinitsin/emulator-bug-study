Okay, let's see. The user is reporting a bug related to QEMU's handling of the AArch64 instruction set. Specifically, when using the blr instruction with x30 (LR) as the operand, the result is incorrect. The problem is that the "bad" executable, which uses blr x30, doesn't print "func" as expected, but works on the actual device. The "good" executable uses blr x9 and works correctly.

The ARMv8 manual says there's no restriction on using x30 with blr. So, the issue must be in QEMU's emulation of that instruction. The instruction blr is a branch with link, which is used for calling subroutines. The x30 register is the link register (LR), which usually holds the return address. But using blr x30 would mean branching to the address stored in LR, which is a valid operation. However, QEMU might be mishandling this case, perhaps not preserving the LR correctly when it's used as both the target and the source of the branch.

This seems to be an error in how QEMU executes the instruction, which would fall under the "instruction" category. The problem isn't a system call (so not syscall), nor is it a general runtime error (so not runtime). The core issue is that the specific instruction is being processed incorrectly by QEMU's emulator. Therefore, the correct category is "instruction".
