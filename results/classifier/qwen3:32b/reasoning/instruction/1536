Okay, let's see. The user is reporting that certain test programs using specific instructions like vextractbm, vextracthm, etc., fail on qemu-ppc64 but not on qemu-ppc64le. The problem is related to QEMU, so I need to figure out which category it falls into: instruction, syscall, or runtime.

First, the issue is with specific assembly instructions. The test programs use these vector extract instructions, and they fail when run under QEMU for PPC64 big-endian. Since the problem doesn't occur on the little-endian version (qemu-ppc64le), it might be that QEMU's emulation of these particular instructions is incorrect for the big-endian mode. 

The categories given are instruction, syscall, or runtime. Since the problem is directly related to the execution of specific CPU instructions and their correct emulation by QEMU, this would fall under the 'instruction' category. It's not a syscall issue because it's about instruction execution, not system calls. It's also not a general runtime error but specifically about the correctness of the instruction emulation. So the answer should be 'instruction'.
