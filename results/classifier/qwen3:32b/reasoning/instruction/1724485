Okay, let's see. The user is reporting an invalid assertion in the arm_read_memory_func function. The assertion is checking if the endianness is little, but they're using armeb-linux, which is big-endian. The problem occurs when glibc's _dl_new_object calls strlen, which is in thumb2 mode. This leads to print_insn_arm calling arm_read_memory_func with length 2 and certain flags, causing the assert to fail.

So the assertion is expecting little-endian, but in this case, it's big-endian (BFD_ENDIAN_BIG maybe?), hence the assert is false. The user says removing the assert allows execution to continue, but with the assert, QEMU stalls. 

The question is whether the assert should be removed or how to fix the stall. The categories are instruction, syscall, or runtime. 

The issue seems to be related to how the instruction is being read. The arm_read_memory_func is part of the code that reads memory for instruction decoding. The assertion is checking endianness, which is part of handling how instructions are read. Since the problem arises during instruction decoding (thumb2 mode, specific CPU flags), this seems to be an issue with the instruction handling. The assert is invalid because in some cases (like big-endian ARM with thumb2), the endianness might not be little, but the code expects it. Therefore, this is an instruction-related bug.
