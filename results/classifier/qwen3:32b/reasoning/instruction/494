Okay, let's tackle this bug report classification. The user says that CMake crashes on qemu-alpha-user with an "Illegal Instruction". The possible categories are instruction, syscall, or runtime.

First, "Illegal Instruction" typically means the CPU encountered an instruction it doesn't recognize or can't execute. Since QEMU is emulating a CPU (in this case, Alpha), this could be due to QEMU not correctly handling a specific instruction that CMake is trying to execute. That points towards the 'instruction' category. 

Syscall errors usually involve system calls failing, which isn't mentioned here. Runtime errors are more general, but the specific mention of Illegal Instruction relates to the instruction set emulation. So, the most fitting category is 'instruction'.
