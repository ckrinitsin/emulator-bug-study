Okay, let's see. The user provided a bug report about an "invalid opcode" error related to "vzeroupper" on Fedora 36. The crash stack and disassembly show that the error occurs in the function sha512_block_data_order_avx2 from libgnutls.so.30. The specific instruction causing the problem is vzeroupper.

First, I need to classify this bug into one of the three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The description mentions an invalid opcode, which directly relates to an instruction. The vzeroupper instruction is an x86 AVX instruction. If the CPU doesn't support AVX, executing this instruction would cause an illegal instruction error (SIGILL). 

Looking at the disassembly, the error is at the vzeroupper line. This suggests that the program is trying to execute an instruction that the CPU doesn't recognize. The categories include "instruction" for cases where a faulty instruction is the cause. Since the problem is the use of an instruction (vzeroupper) that isn't supported by the current processor, this fits the "instruction" category. 

The other categories don't seem to fit here. There's no mention of a syscall failing, so "syscall" isn't right. "Runtime" is for other runtime errors, but this is specifically about an invalid instruction opcode, which is more about the instruction set compatibility. Therefore, the correct classification should be "instruction".
