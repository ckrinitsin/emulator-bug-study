Okay, let's see. The user is reporting a SIGILL error when the "stck" instruction is executed under qemu-s390x in user mode. The same instruction works in system mode. The problem is reproducible with both Debian's version and the latest upstream master. The issue causes a crash in ssh-keygen, which uses "stck" for randomness. The minimal example provided compiles and crashes in user mode but works in system mode. The log shows the instruction is being traced.

So, the key points here are that the bug is related to a specific instruction ("stck") not being handled correctly in user mode. The instruction works in system mode, so maybe user mode lacks the emulation for this instruction. Since "stck" is a S/390x instruction equivalent to x86's rdtsc, it's possible that QEMU's user mode doesn't properly emulate this instruction, leading to an illegal instruction signal. The fact that it's handled in system mode suggests that the system mode has the necessary emulation, but user mode doesn't. Therefore, this is an instruction-related bug in QEMU's user mode emulation. The category should be "instruction".
