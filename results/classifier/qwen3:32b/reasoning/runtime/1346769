Okay, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user is talking about running 32-bit binaries under a 64-bit QEMU and having an issue with AddressSanitizer (Asan) not finding the stack boundaries. The problem seems to be related to the /proc/self/maps not having the stack record. 

Looking at the code snippet provided, there's a conditional in QEMU's linux-user/syscall.c that only adds the stack entry to the /proc/self/maps for specific architectures (ARM, M68K, UNICORE32). The user is wondering why those targets are the only ones included. Since Asan relies on this stack entry to determine stack boundaries, its absence for other architectures would cause the runtime error described.

The error occurs because during initialization, Asan can't find the stack boundaries in /proc/self/maps. This is a runtime issue because it's happening when the program is executed, specifically when Asan is trying to set up its checks. The problem isn't with a syscall itself, but rather how QEMU emulates the /proc/self/maps file, which affects runtime behavior. It's not about a faulty instruction either. So the category should be "runtime".
