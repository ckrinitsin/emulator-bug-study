Okay, let's see. The user is reporting an issue with QEMU's alpha target not supporting TCG plugin register tracking because there's no XML file. The problem is that the register list is built from XML, and since alpha is old, there's no XML, so register tracking isn't working. They suggest synthesizing an XML to fix it.

I need to classify this into one of the categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. 

First, instruction-related bugs usually involve incorrect or faulty CPU instructions. This doesn't seem to be about a specific instruction being wrong. The issue is about missing register tracking due to missing XML data. 

Syscall errors are about system calls, which are interactions between the program and the OS. This bug isn't related to system calls either. 

Runtime errors are other issues that occur during execution. Since the problem is that the plugin can't track registers because the necessary data (XML) isn't present, leading to a functionality issue when running the plugin, this seems like a runtime problem. The absence of the XML causes the plugin to not function correctly during execution. 

So the category should be runtime.
