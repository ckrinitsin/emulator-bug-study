Okay, let's see. The user is trying to run a Debian package for Parity on an ARM system using qemu-x86_64. The error they get is "setup_rt_frame: not implemented" followed by a segmentation fault. 

First, I need to figure out what "setup_rt_frame" refers to. I remember that in QEMU, when emulating signals or handling exceptions, there's some setup involved for the signal frame. The function setup_rt_frame is part of the code that handles real-time signals in Linux user mode emulation.

The error message says it's not implemented. That suggests that QEMU's user-mode emulation for x86_64 on ARM doesn't have the necessary code to handle the setup of the real-time signal frame. This would be a problem in how QEMU is handling the signal delivery, which is a runtime aspect. 

Since the error is about a missing implementation in QEMU's runtime handling of signals, this isn't a syscall error per se. The segmentation fault is a symptom of the deeper issue, which is that the setup_rt_frame function isn't implemented. Therefore, this falls under runtime errors in QEMU.
