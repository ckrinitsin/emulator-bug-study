Okay, let's see. The user is using QEMU on a Raspberry Pi 4 with ESXi, running a CentOS VM and a Docker container with Debian and qemu-i386. The error message is about receiving a signal outside the vCPU context, with varying pc addresses.

First, I need to classify this bug into instruction, syscall, or runtime. The error message mentions "handle_cpu_signal" and "signal outside vCPU context". Signals in Unix-like systems are used for handling asynchronous events, like interrupts. When QEMU runs, it manages virtual CPUs, and if a signal is received when it's not in the vCPU context, that's a runtime issue. The pc (program counter) values are different each time, which might indicate where the signal was caught, but the core problem is about signal handling during execution. Since it's about the runtime handling of signals in the context of the CPU emulation, it's not an instruction error or syscall error. So the category should be runtime.
