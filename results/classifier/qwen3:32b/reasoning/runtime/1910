Okay, let's see. The user is reporting an issue with signal handlers in x86_64 userspace where the stack is misaligned, causing crashes due to `movaps` instructions. They mentioned that QEMU is involved, and provided some code snippets from the Linux kernel's signal handling.

The problem seems to be related to stack alignment when a signal handler is invoked. The x86_64 ABI requires that the stack is 16-byte aligned at function entry. The user points out that QEMU's signal handling isn't maintaining this alignment correctly. The kernel code they referenced shows how the stack pointer is adjusted before transferring control to the signal handler. The issue might be that QEMU isn't adhering to the required alignment, leading to misaligned stack addresses when the handler runs, which causes the `movaps` instruction (which requires 16-byte alignment) to crash.

The categories given are instruction, syscall, or runtime. Since the problem is about incorrect stack alignment when executing a signal handler, which is part of the program's runtime environment, it's likely a runtime issue. The faulty instruction (`movaps`) is a symptom, but the root cause is the misalignment due to how the signal handler is set up. The kernel's signal handling code is responsible for setting up the stack correctly, and if QEMU's implementation isn't doing that properly, it's a runtime error in how the environment is managed, not a direct syscall or an incorrect instruction itself. So the category should be runtime.
