Okay, let's see. The user provided a bug report related to QEMU and wants me to classify it into one of the three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime.

The problem discussed is about checking page crossings in the use_goto_tb() function. The bug report mentions that some targets like hppa have a fix, but others don't. The proposed solution involves fixing linux-user/mmap.c to handle invalidations, which could improve performance by up to 6.93%. 

Hmm. The key here is to figure out what category this falls into. The instruction category is for faulty instructions. The syscall category is about syscall errors. Runtime errors are other issues happening during runtime.

The issue here seems to be related to how page crossings are handled in the use_goto_tb() function. This function is part of the code generation or execution process. The problem isn't about a specific instruction being wrong, nor is it directly about a syscall. It's more about the runtime behavior of the code when it comes to handling memory pages and invalidations. The fix involves ensuring proper invalidations in mmap.c, which deals with memory management, so it's a runtime issue because it affects how the program runs and manages memory during execution. 

Therefore, the category should be 'runtime'.
