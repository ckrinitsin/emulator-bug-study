Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is saying that their code works on actual PPC64LE hardware with GCC 10, but when run under QEMU (versions 4.2 and 5.0), it fails silently without any errors like illegal instructions. The issue is that the computed value doesn't match the expected one, leading to an abort.

Hmm. The problem isn't about illegal instructions, so it's probably not an instruction emulation issue. If QEMU was missing an instruction, you'd expect an illegal instruction error. Since it's running without errors but producing different results, maybe there's something about the runtime environment.

Wait, maybe it's related to system calls? But the user didn't mention any syscalls specifically. The problem is in the computed value, which could be due to differences in how QEMU handles certain operations compared to real hardware. However, the category options are instruction, syscall, or runtime.

Runtime errors could include things like timing issues, differences in CPU behavior, endianness, or other architectural nuances. Since the code is compiled for PPC64LE and runs on both real hardware and QEMU, but behaves differently, it's possible that QEMU isn't accurately emulating some aspect of the hardware's runtime behavior. For example, maybe some CPU flags, specific instruction behaviors that aren't covered by just the instruction set, or even differences in how certain registers are handled. Since the user mentions that the same binary works on real hardware but not QEMU, and there's no illegal instruction error, it's likely that QEMU's emulation of the runtime environment is the culprit. So the category would be 'runtime'.
