Okay, let's see. The user is encountering a "qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped" issue when using Docker images that rely on QEMU on macOS. They followed the Botfront installation steps, ran the application, and then tried accessing the botfront-rasa container, which led to the error.

First, I need to categorize this bug report into one of the three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The error message mentions an uncaught target signal 6, which is an abort signal. Signal 6 in Unix systems corresponds to SIGABRT, which is typically raised when a program aborts, often due to an unhandled exception or a failed assertion.

Looking at the categories:
- "Instruction" refers to a faulty instruction described in the bug report. That usually means there's a specific step or command that's incorrect. The user did follow steps to reproduce, but the error seems to be during execution, not because of a wrong instruction.
- "Syscall" errors are related to system calls failing. The error here doesn't mention a specific system call failure but rather a signal being uncaught.
- "Runtime" errors are issues that occur during the execution of the program. The core dumped error is a runtime crash, so this seems more likely.

The problem occurs when running the Docker container, leading to a crash during execution. The signal 6 (SIGABRT) is a runtime error, indicating that the QEMU process is aborting unexpectedly. Therefore, the category should be "runtime".
