Okay, let's see. The user is reporting an issue with QEMU's TCG plugins where the program counter (PC) isn't being updated for each instruction when using the execlog plugin. They provided output logs with and without the -one-insn-per-tb option. The problem seems to be that the PC register isn't being tracked correctly unless each instruction is in its own TB (Translation Block). 

The documentation says the plugin should dump registers when they change, including PC. The user's code checks the PC value each instruction and prints it if it changed. However, without -one-insn-per-tb, the PC isn't being updated as expected. The root cause seems to be that qemu_plugin_read_register() returns the same value multiple times, implying that the register isn't being re-read properly within the same TB.

In QEMU's TCG, each TB is a block of translated code. When multiple instructions are in a single TB, the plugin might not be getting callbacks for each individual instruction's register changes. The -one-insn-per-tb forces each instruction into its own TB, which makes the plugin work as expected. So the issue is likely related to how plugins are notified of register changes within a TB. 

This isn't about a specific instruction being wrong (so not 'instruction'), nor a syscall (so not 'syscall'). It's about the runtime behavior of the plugin not receiving updated register values when multiple instructions are in a single TB. Therefore, the category should be 'runtime'.
