Okay, let's see. The user is reporting an issue with QEMU where disabling SVE using the -cpu max,sve=off option doesn't also disable SVE2 in the getauxval output. The problem is that even when SVE is turned off, SVE2 still shows as enabled, which is inconsistent because SVE2 depends on SVE being present.

First, I need to figure out what category this falls into. The options are instruction, syscall, or runtime. The bug report is about the CPU features being advertised incorrectly via getauxval. The getauxval function is used to retrieve auxiliary vector values, which includes hardware capability information like HWCAP and HWCAP2. These are system-level features that the kernel reports to user space.

The issue isn't about a specific instruction being incorrect (so not instruction), nor is it a direct syscall error (though getauxval is a syscall, the problem is about the values it returns). The problem is that the QEMU's CPU model is not correctly handling the dependency between SVE and SVE2 features. When SVE is disabled, SVE2 should also be disabled because SVE2 is an extension of SVE. However, QEMU's current implementation doesn't enforce this dependency when modifying the CPU features via the -cpu option.

This seems to be a runtime issue because it's about how the QEMU emulator is configuring the CPU features during the execution of the guest. The incorrect advertisement of features affects the runtime behavior of applications checking those capabilities. The QEMU code responsible for setting up the CPU features and their dependencies isn't properly handling the case when SVE is turned off, leading to an inconsistent state in the reported hardware capabilities.

Therefore, the category should be runtime.
