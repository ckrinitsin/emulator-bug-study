Okay, let's see. The user is reporting a bug in QEMU's SLIRP networking where the hostfwd option ignores the specified bind address and uses INADDR_ANY instead. The problem is that even when they try to bind to localhost (127.0.0.1), QEMU ends up listening on all interfaces, which is a security risk.

Looking at the categories provided: instruction, syscall, runtime. 

First, an instruction bug would be if there's a wrong step in the setup or configuration. But here, the issue is in the code where it's hardcoded to INADDR_ANY, not following the user's input. 

A syscall error would involve incorrect system calls. The problem here isn't about a syscall failing but about the parameters passed to it. The code is using the wrong address, so the syscall itself might be correct but the arguments are wrong.

Runtime errors are issues that occur during execution, like logic errors. Since the code is not respecting the user's bind address and instead using a default, this seems like a runtime logic error. The code isn't handling the user-provided address correctly, leading to unintended behavior during runtime.

So the correct category here is runtime.
