Okay, let's see. The user is talking about a problem with QEMU's static linux-user ARM emulation having a slow startup time. The issue comes up when they upgraded from version 2.8 to 2.11. The main problem is that the startup time increased from 0.006s to 3s. The root cause seems to be related to the init_guest_space function in elfload.c. 

The user explains that init_guest_space tries to map two parts of the address space. The first mmap call with NULL is supposed to find a suitable base address. But in the static build of 2.11, this process is taking thousands of attempts, leading to the delay. They mention that the static build disables PIE and ASLR, which causes the text segment to be at a fixed address (0x60000000), making it harder to find a suitable base address because the required second mapping at 0xffff0000 conflicts with existing mappings.

The key factors here are the increased guest_size in 2.11 and the lack of ASLR in static builds. The problem is about the runtime behavior of the program when trying to allocate memory addresses, which is causing the slowdown. They also suggest possible fixes involving different mmap strategies or checking /proc/self/maps, but the core issue is during the runtime memory mapping process.

Since the problem is related to how memory is being mapped during the execution of the program, and it's causing delays due to repeated mmap calls, this falls under runtime issues. There's no mention of a specific syscall failing, just that the process of mapping memory is inefficient. So the category here is runtime.
