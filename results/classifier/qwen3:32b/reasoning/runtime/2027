Okay, let's see. The user provided a bug report that includes a stack trace and some error messages. The task is to classify this bug into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime.

First, I need to understand what each category means. The instruction category is for when there's a faulty instruction described. Syscall is for errors related to system calls. Runtime is for other runtime errors, possibly from the Go runtime or other program execution issues.

Looking at the error message, there's an "exit status 2" at the end. The stack trace shows multiple goroutines (which are Go routines) that are stuck in GC (garbage collection) workers. The lines mention "runtime.gopark" which is part of the Go runtime. The Go runtime manages goroutines, scheduling, garbage collection, etc. 

The error seems to be related to the Go runtime's garbage collection process. The program is exiting with status 2, which in Go programs could indicate a runtime panic or an error during execution. Since the stack trace is filled with runtime functions (like gopark) and the issue is about goroutines being in a parked state during GC, this points towards a runtime issue rather than a specific syscall or instruction fault.

I don't see any mention of system calls (like open, read, write, etc.) in the provided data. Also, there's no indication of a specific faulty instruction like a segmentation fault or invalid opcode. The problem seems to be within the Go runtime's handling of goroutines and garbage collection. Therefore, the correct category should be "runtime".
