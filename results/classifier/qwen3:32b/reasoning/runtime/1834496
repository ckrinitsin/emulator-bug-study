Okay, let's see. The user is reporting regressions in QEMU when running GCC tests on an ARM target. The specific error is a crash with "uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped". They mention that this happens with recent QEMU commits compared to version 3.1.

First, I need to figure out what category this falls into: instruction, syscall, or runtime. 

The error is a signal 6, which is SIGABRT, an abort signal. That usually indicates some kind of runtime error, like an assertion failure or a program termination. The user is saying that QEMU is crashing when running these tests, which suggests it's happening during execution, not during a syscall or instruction handling specifically.

The problem is that the tests used to pass before but now fail in QEMU. The crash is in QEMU itself, so it's a runtime issue. The user also mentions that it's not a specific instruction but a broader runtime error. Since the crash is due to an unhandled signal, which is a runtime error, the category should be "runtime".
