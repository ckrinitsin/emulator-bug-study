Okay, let's see. The user is having an issue running an x86_64 binary on an aarch64 host using QEMU. The error message is about not finding a guest_base to satisfy address mapping requirements. The problem occurs with a specific static binary built in an Alpine container, but not with another binary built on an x86 system.

Hmm, the error message mentions guest address mappings. QEMU uses address translation for emulating different architectures. The guest_base is probably related to how QEMU maps the guest's memory addresses to the host's. If there's an issue with these mappings, it could be a runtime problem because it's happening when the program is executed, not during compilation or a syscall.

The user tested different QEMU versions. The older 7.2.7 works, but 8.1.3 and newer have the issue. That suggests a change in QEMU's handling of memory mappings. Since it's about address mapping during execution, this seems like a runtime error. The syscall category would involve system calls failing, but the error here is more about memory layout setup by QEMU. Instruction errors would be if there was an invalid instruction, but the error is about memory mapping. So runtime makes sense here.
