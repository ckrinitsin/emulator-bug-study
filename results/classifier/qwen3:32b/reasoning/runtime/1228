Okay, let's see. The user is having an issue with QEMU's curses display not recognizing escape sequences properly. They mentioned that when using the curses display, the escape commands like Ctrl+X A or Alt+2 don't work, but they do work with the graphical display. Also, they tested on Linux and macOS, and through SSH with different terminals.

The problem seems to be related to how the curses display handles input. The user provided some showkey outputs. For example, when pressing Alt+2 in Terminus (SSH to Ubuntu), it sends ESC followed by 2. But when using macOS Terminal with SSH, pressing Option+2 sends @, and Esc+2 sends ESC followed by 2. They noticed that pressing ESC and 2 at the same time works. 

So, the issue might be that the curses display in QEMU requires the escape sequence to be sent very quickly. If there's a delay between the ESC and the next key, it doesn't recognize it. The graphical display might be more lenient with timing, hence working correctly. This points to a runtime issue because it's about how the input is processed during execution. There's no mention of incorrect instructions or syscalls, so it's probably not those categories. The problem occurs during runtime input handling, so the category is runtime.
