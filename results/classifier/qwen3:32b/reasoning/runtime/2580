Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is using QEMU's aarch64_be emulator, version 9.1.0. They're trying to run a simple Linux program compiled for AArch64 big-endian, but it's failing with an error in gdb_find_static_feature(), which says the code should not be reached. The error leads to a SIGABRT.

First, the problem occurs when running the program, not during compilation or linking. The error is in the QEMU code, specifically in the gdbstub part. The function gdb_find_static_feature is supposed to handle some GDB-related features, but it's hitting an unreachable code path. That suggests that QEMU's internal logic for handling GDB features isn't prepared for some scenario that's arising here.

Since the error happens at runtime when executing the program under QEMU, it's not about a syscall directly. The user isn't mentioning a specific system call failing. It's also not an instruction issue, because the problem isn't about executing an incorrect or unsupported instruction. The error is in QEMU's own code logic during runtime, specifically in the GDB stub code. So the category would be "runtime".
