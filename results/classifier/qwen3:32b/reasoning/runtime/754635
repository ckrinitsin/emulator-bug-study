Okay, let's try to figure out what category this bug report falls into. The user is talking about the -d option in QEMU, specifically the in_asm option, which is used for logging instructions. They noticed that when they run a certain command with different versions of QEMU (0.14.0 vs 0.12.5), the output regarding memory sections (like start, end, size, protection) is different. 

In the 0.14.0 version, the output seems off. The user did some code analysis and found a difference in the exec.c file between the two versions. They modified the code by adjusting the shift value in a calculation involving V_L1_SHIFT and TARGET_PAGE_BITS, which fixed the issue. The problem seems to be related to how memory regions are being calculated or reported, leading to incorrect section information in the log.

Now, the categories to choose from are instruction, syscall, or runtime. The instruction category is about faulty instructions being described. The syscall category is for errors related to system calls. The runtime category covers other runtime errors.

Since the issue is about incorrect memory section information being logged when using the -d in_asm option, which is part of QEMU's execution and logging, this seems to be a problem that occurs during the runtime of the program. The user's fix involves adjusting how memory regions are processed, which affects the runtime behavior of QEMU. Therefore, this is a runtime issue.
