Okay, let's see. The user is reporting an issue with QEMU's AArch64 SVE emulation causing test failures for strnlen and strrchr functions. The problem appears when using QEMU 5.2.0 but works with the '-cpu max,sve-max-vq=2' option. The test code is from ARM's optimized-routines repository. The error messages show that the SVE version of the function returns 64 instead of the expected length, which suggests it's not stopping at the null terminator correctly.

The user mentions that the code shouldn't be vector length specific, but the issue is resolved by limiting the SVE vector length with the cpu option. Since SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) allows variable vector lengths, the emulation might be handling different vector lengths incorrectly. The problem isn't with the actual instruction execution per se, but rather how QEMU emulates the SVE behavior, especially with varying vector lengths. The test passes when restricting the maximum vector length, implying that the emulation might have a flaw in handling larger vector sizes. This seems like an issue with QEMU's runtime emulation of SVE, not a specific instruction being wrong or a syscall problem. So the category should be 'runtime'.
