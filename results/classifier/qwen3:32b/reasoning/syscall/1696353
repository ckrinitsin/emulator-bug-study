Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is saying that Go binaries fail to start under qemu's linux-user mode. The error message mentions a failure to create a new OS thread, with an error number 22, which is EINVAL (invalid argument). The stack trace points to the Go runtime's newosproc function, which uses the clone system call.

Looking at the Go source code mentioned, in os_linux.go, the clone flags are set. The user mentions that the CLONE_SYSVMEM flag is missing. The patch provided probably adds this flag. 

The issue seems to be that without CLONE_SYSVMEM, the clone system call is failing. This flag is necessary for certain memory sharing between the parent and child processes, especially in environments like QEMU's user-mode emulation. Since the problem is related to the flags passed to the clone system call, which is a system call, this would be a syscall issue. 

The error isn't about the program's logic or instructions but about how the system call is being made incorrectly. The runtime is involved, but the specific problem is with the syscall parameters. So the category should be 'syscall'.
