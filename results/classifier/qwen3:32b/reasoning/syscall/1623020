Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to run an AMD64 binary on an ARM7 host using QEMU. The error messages mention things like "bad timediv" and "runtime: panic before malloc heap initialized". 

First, I need to recall how QEMU user-mode emulation works. It allows running binaries for different architectures on the host without a full system emulation. But there might be limitations, especially with certain system calls or CPU features.

Looking at the error output, the key part is "bad timediv". The 'timediv' is a system call used by some programs to get the system's time. But wait, the user is using QEMU's user-mode emulation. Maybe the ARM host's kernel doesn't support the 'timediv' system call that the x86 binary is trying to use through QEMU. However, the error here is coming from the Go runtime, which suggests that the problem might be related to how the Go program initializes.

The Go runtime needs to set up the heap and stack properly. The message "panic before malloc heap initialized" implies that the Go runtime couldn't initialize its memory structures. This could be due to a missing or incorrect system call during the startup process. QEMU might not be correctly emulating a specific system call that the Go runtime relies on for setting up memory.

Another angle: the user compiled QEMU with --static, which might include all necessary libraries, but maybe some system call handling is missing. The 'strace' output shows that the program is making calls like arch_prctl and select, which are related to process control and I/O multiplexing. The 'select' system call returning "Bad address" might indicate that the arguments passed by QEMU to the host's system call are incorrect. However, since QEMU is emulating the system calls, maybe it's translating them incorrectly for the ARM environment.

Wait, the error "bad timediv" is a system call that's specific to some architectures. For example, on ARM, the 'timediv' system call might not exist, and QEMU might be translating an x86 system call into an ARM one incorrectly. If the x86 binary is making a system call that QEMU can't map to the ARM host's equivalent, that would cause a failure. In this case, the Go runtime might be using a system call that's available on x86 but not on ARM, and QEMU isn't handling that translation properly.

So the problem here is likely a syscall issue. The QEMU emulator isn't correctly handling a specific system call required by the Go program, leading to the runtime errors. The 'timediv' error is a syscall-related problem, and the subsequent heap initialization failure is a result of that. Therefore, the category should be 'syscall'.
