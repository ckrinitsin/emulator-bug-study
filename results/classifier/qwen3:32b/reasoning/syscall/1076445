Okay, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user is saying that when they use qemu-i386 with a cross-compiled program that calls system(), it returns -1, but it works on other architectures like arm and mips. The same problem occurs with x86_64.

First, the system() function in C is used to execute shell commands. When the program runs, it should call the system's shell to execute the command. The fact that it works on arm and mips but not on i386 and x86_64 suggests there might be an issue specific to those architectures in QEMU.

The error here is that the system() call returns -1, which usually indicates an error. So, the question is why QEMU is failing to handle the system call correctly for i386 and x86_64 but not others.

Possible categories are instruction, syscall, or runtime. 

Instruction would be if the CPU emulation was incorrect, like a wrong instruction being executed. But system() relies on syscalls, so maybe it's a syscall issue. 

Looking at the setup: QEMU's syscall emulation might be missing something for i386 and x86_64. The other architectures (arm, mips) work, so maybe there's a difference in how syscalls are handled in those emulated environments. 

The user is using uClibc, which might have different syscall numbers or handling compared to glibc. If QEMU's syscall translation for i386/x86_64 isn't compatible with uClibc's system() implementation, that could cause the error. 

Since the problem is specifically with the system() call, which is a libc function that makes a syscall (like execve or similar), the issue likely lies in how QEMU handles that particular syscall for those architectures. Therefore, the category would be syscall.
