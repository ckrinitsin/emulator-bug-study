Okay, let's see. The user is reporting that QEMU's linux-user mode doesn't support OFD fcntl locks, which are non-POSIX. They mentioned that when they try to use F_OFD_SETLK, F_OFD_SETLKW, or F_OFD_GETLK, it results in an EINVAL error. Looking into the QEMU source code, specifically linux-user/syscall.c, the issue seems to be in the target_to_host_fcntl_cmd function where these commands aren't handled, leading to a default case.

So, the problem is that these specific fcntl commands aren't translated properly from the target (like ppc64 or s390x) to the host (x86_64) system calls. Since fcntl is a system call, this would fall under syscall handling in QEMU's user-mode emulation. The error occurs because the syscall translation is missing these cases, leading to an invalid argument error. Therefore, this is a syscall-related issue.
