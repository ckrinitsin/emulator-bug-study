Okay, let's tackle this bug report. The user is having an issue with fakeroot under QEMU failing with a "semop(1): encountered an error: Function not implemented" message. They mentioned it's similar to Debian bug 965109, which was about QEMU not handling certain syscalls. 

First, I need to classify this bug into one of the three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The error message directly references the semop syscall, which is a system call used for semaphore operations. The error says the function isn't implemented, which suggests that QEMU isn't handling that particular syscall correctly.

The user built QEMU from the latest git repo, which supposedly includes the fix for the mentioned Debian bug. But the problem persists. This could mean that either the fix isn't applied correctly, there's a regression, or maybe another syscall-related issue. Since the error is specifically about a syscall not being implemented, the category should be syscall.

The other categories don't fit here. It's not about a faulty instruction (like an invalid CPU instruction), nor is it a general runtime error. The core issue is QEMU's handling (or lack thereof) of the semop syscall. So the correct classification is syscall.
