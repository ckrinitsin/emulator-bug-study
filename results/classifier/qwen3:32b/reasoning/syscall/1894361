Okay, let's see. The user is reporting an issue with QEMU. The problem is that in the syscall.c file, there's a missing pselect6_time64. They mentioned a commit where the legacy pselect6 definition for RISC-V 32 was removed in favor of pselect6_time64, but that new one isn't in syscall.c, so RISC-V 32 is left without the pselect syscall.

So, I need to classify this bug report into one of the three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The categories are given, and the answer should be just the category name. 

First, the bug is about a missing syscall (pselect6_time64) in syscall.c. The user is saying that the syscall isn't available, which is causing an issue for RISC-V 32. The commit removed the old definition and supposed to use the new one, but that new one isn't implemented. 

Since the problem is directly related to a syscall not being present or properly handled in the syscall.c file, this would fall under the 'syscall' category. The error isn't about an instruction being wrong (which would be 'instruction'), nor is it a runtime error like a crash or incorrect behavior during execution (which would be 'runtime'). It's specifically about the syscall definition missing, so the correct category is 'syscall'.
