Okay, let's see. The user is having issues with go build under qemu-ppc64le-static in a Docker container. The problem occurs with multi-threaded Go commands, leading to hangs, segfaults, or other errors. They mention that when using GOMAXPROCS=1 and building with -p 1, it works fine, but when using multiple threads, it fails.

Looking at the error message, there's a fatal error related to stopm holding locks and an unexpected signal during runtime. The stack trace includes syscall.Syscall6 and some issues with signals like SIGSEGV. The key part here is that the problem arises with multi-threaded execution, which suggests it's related to how QEMU handles threading or system calls on ppc64le.

The user also notes that the same issue occurs with arm64, which might indicate a common problem in QEMU's user-mode emulation for multiple architectures when handling threading. Since the problem disappears when running single-threaded, it's likely not an issue with the Go code itself but with how QEMU manages multiple threads in user-mode.

In QEMU's context, syscall handling is crucial for emulating system calls correctly across different architectures. If there's a flaw in how syscalls are managed for multi-threaded applications, especially on ppc64le and arm64, that could lead to the observed crashes. The error messages point to syscall.Syscall6 and a segmentation violation, which hints at syscall handling issues. The runtime errors are symptoms, but the root cause is probably in how QEMU processes syscalls in a multi-threaded environment.

The categories to choose from are instruction, syscall, or runtime. Since the problem is tied to system calls in a multi-threaded context and the error messages involve syscalls and signals, the most fitting category is syscall. It's not an instruction error because the problem isn't about executing wrong instructions but about handling system calls correctly across threads. Runtime errors are general, but the specifics here point more directly to syscall handling in QEMU.
