Okay, let's see. The user is reporting an issue with bash here-documents failing after an update to gnulib and coreutils. The error is "cat: -: No such file or directory". The problem seems to be related to how newfstatat is behaving differently than fstat.

Looking at the strace output, in the problematic case, newfstatat is called with AT_EMPTY_PATH, and it returns ENOENT. Whereas in the old system, fstat is used and it works. The key difference here is the syscall being usedâ€”newfstatat versus fstat. The error arises because newfstatat is not finding the file, but fstat did before. 

Since the issue is about the behavior of a syscall (newfstatat vs fstat) leading to an error, this would fall under the syscall category. The problem isn't about an incorrect instruction or runtime errors but specifically the syscall's handling. So the correct classification should be syscall.
