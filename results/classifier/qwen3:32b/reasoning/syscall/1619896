Okay, let's try to figure out the category for this QEMU bug report. The user is running a Teamspeak server on ARM using QEMU to emulate x86. The main issue is about "Unsupported ancillary data: 0/8" which comes from QEMU's linux-user/syscall.c.

Ancillary data is part of socket programming, specifically when using ancillary messages with sendmsg/recvmsg. The error suggests that QEMU's user-mode emulation doesn't support a particular type of ancillary data, probably related to IP_PKTINFO. The user mentioned the cmsg (which is control messages in sockets) and the error occurs when a second client connects, leading to connection drops.

Since this error is related to a system call (probably sendmsg or recvmsg) where the QEMU emulator doesn't handle the ancillary data correctly, it's a syscall issue. The problem isn't with the instruction set emulation but with how a specific syscall is handled. The error message points directly to QEMU's syscall handling code. So the category should be syscall.
