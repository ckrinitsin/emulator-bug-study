Okay, let's see. The problem is about translating host errno to target errno in IP_RECVERR and IPV6_RECVERR. The description says that in the translated control messages, the ee_errno isn't translated, so the guest sees the host's errno. For example, ECONNREFUSED is 111 on x86_64 but should be 146 in MIPS ABI.

The steps to reproduce point to a specific CI test, and the code lines in QEMU's syscall.c. The fix example uses host_to_target_errno on the ee_errno field.

So, the core issue is that when handling these socket options (IP_RECVERR etc.), QEMU isn't converting the errno value from the host's architecture to the target's. This is a system call related problem because it's about handling the parameters of a syscall (probably getsockopt or similar) where the error values need to be adjusted for the target architecture. 

The categories are instruction, syscall, or runtime. Since this is about syscall parameter translation, it's a syscall category. The problem isn't about a runtime error like a crash but rather incorrect handling of syscall arguments (errno values). So the classification should be 'syscall'.
