Okay, let's see. The user is reporting that pulseaudio applications crash when run under qemu-i386 or qemu-x86_64 on Debian 8.0. The test program they provided uses pulseaudio's simple API to create a stream and write some data. When running natively, it works without output or errors, but under QEMU, it segfaults. The user mentions they think it's related to futex and observed an assertion failure in pa_mutex_unlock when debugging pulseaudio.

First, I need to figure out what category this fits into: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The user suspects futex, which is a system call used for thread synchronization. The segmentation fault occurs in QEMU, which is an emulator. The problem seems to be when the application uses pulseaudio under QEMU. The assertion in pa_mutex_unlock suggests an issue with mutex operations, which are typically handled via system calls like futex. Since QEMU has to emulate system calls for threading, there might be a problem there. The user's mention of futex and the syscall-related nature of mutex operations points towards a syscall issue. The crash is due to an unhandled signal (SIGSEGV) during a system call emulation. Therefore, this is likely a syscall-related bug in QEMU.
