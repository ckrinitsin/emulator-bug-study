Okay, let's see. The user is reporting that Go binaries panic with "mmap errno 9" when running on qemu-user. The error message mentions mmap and errno 9. I need to figure out what category this falls into: instruction, syscall, or runtime.

First, errno 9 is "Bad file descriptor." But mmap is a system call. So the error is happening during an mmap system call. The user is using qemu-user, which is user-mode emulation. The problem doesn't occur on real hardware, so it's specific to QEMU's emulation.

The Go runtime is trying to perform an mmap, which is a syscall. The error suggests that the syscall is failing. Since the issue is with the system call's behavior in QEMU, this would be a syscall-related problem. The runtime is doing the correct thing, but the syscall (mmap) isn't working as expected in QEMU's environment. Therefore, the category should be 'syscall'.
