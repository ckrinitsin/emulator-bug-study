Okay, let's try to figure out what category this bug report falls into. The user is saying that QEMU User (x86_64) hangs after a "futex function not implemented" error. The problem occurs when they try to run a Valheim server binary using QEMU on both an ARM64 Raspberry Pi and an x86_64 Fedora host with QEMU's master branch. 

Looking at the strace output, the last call before the hang is a futex system call that returns -1 with errno 38, which means "Function not implemented." Then, when they send a SIGINT, another futex call is interrupted. The key here is the futex system call. Futex is a Linux system call used for thread synchronization. 

The categories to choose from are instruction, syscall, or runtime. 

The error here is specifically about a system call (futex) not being implemented. The QEMU User mode is supposed to handle system calls from the emulated binary. If QEMU doesn't support or properly handle the futex syscall for the target architecture (x86_64 in this case), that would be a syscall issue. 

The user mentions that the same problem occurs on different hosts (ARM and x86) when using QEMU, which suggests that QEMU's handling of the futex syscall is missing or incorrect. Since futex is a Linux syscall, and QEMU needs to intercept and handle it correctly, this points to a syscall-related bug in QEMU.

So, the category should be "syscall".
