qemu-arm stalls on a GCC sanitizer test since qemu-2.7

Hi,

I have noticed that several GCC/sanitizer tests fail with timeout when executed under QEMU.

After a bit of investigation, I have noticed that this worked with qemu-2.7, and started failing with qemu-2.8, and still fails with qemu-2.10.1

I'm attaching a tarball containing:
alloca_instruments_all_paddings.exe : the testcase, and the needed libs:
lib/librt.so.1
lib/libdl.so.2
lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3
lib/libasan.so.5
lib/libc.so.6
lib/libgcc_s.so.1
lib/libpthread.so.0
lib/libm.so.6

To reproduce the problem:
$ qemu-arm -cpu any -R 0 -L $PWD $PWD/alloca_instruments_all_paddings.exe
returns in less than a second with qemu-2.7, and never with qemu-2.8

Using -d in_asm suggests that the program "almost" completes and qemu seems to stall on:
