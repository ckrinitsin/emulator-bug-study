sh4: ghc randomly segfaults on qemu-sh4-static

Hello!

I am currently in the process of bootstrapping ghc for the Debian sh4 port and ran into a strange problem with qemu-sh4-static which randomly segfaults when running ghc to compile a Haskell source:

As seen above, compiling a Haskell source code often results in a segfault but simply by retrying to run ghc over and over again, the compile process will eventually succeed and no segfault occurs.

I have created a tarball which contains the sh4 chroot from the example above which also includes ghc, gcc and the source code in question (in /root/ghc-7.8.4/utils/ghc-pwd). To test, it's probably a good idea to replace the qemu-sh4-static binary in /usr/bin with a current git snapshot (which I tried but didn't help).

In case anyone wants to try ghc with their own sh4 chroot, here's my version of ghc:

> https://people.debian.org/~glaubitz/sh4-unknown-linux-gnu-ghc-7.10.3.tar.gz

Just extract in the chroot of the sh4 chroot.

Please note, that it might be advisable on sh4 to apply the patches from these two bug reports as otherwise qemu-sh4-static won't work properly on sh4 and misses syscall 186:

> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu-linaro/+bug/1254824
> https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1516408

The above issue is reproducible with the two patches applied and without. It's also reproducible with both libc6 2.19 and 2.21 in the chroot. Thus, I am currently out of ideas what else to test.

Cheers,
Adrian
