linux-user clone() can't handle glibc posix_spawn() (causes locale-gen to assert)

I'm running a command command (locale-gen) inside of an armv7h chroot mounted on my x86_64 desktop by putting qemu-arm-static into /usr/bin/ of the chroot file system and I get a core dump.

locale-gen
Generating locales...
  en_US.UTF-8...localedef: ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/spawni.c:360: __spawnix: Assertion `ec >= 0' failed.
qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped

I've done this same thing successfully for years, but this breakage has appeared some time in the last 3 or so months. Possibly with the update to qemu version 2.8.
