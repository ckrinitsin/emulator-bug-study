tcg-target.inc.c:3495:no such instruction: `xgetbv'

While building QEMU on Mac OS 10.6.8 I saw this error message:
tag-target.inc.c:3495:no such instruction: `xgetbv'
In the file tcg/i386/tcg-target.inc.c at line 3495 is where the issue is located. This is the problem code:
asm ("xgetbv" : "=a" (xcrl), "=d" (xcrh) : "c" (0));

https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit/issues/78
According to the above link, another project also experienced this problem on Mac OS X. The fix was to replace the name of the instruction with the encoded form '.byte 0x0F, 0x01, 0xd0'. 

Host info:
Mac OS 10.6.8
GCC 5.2.0

Additional information:
This may be a gcc issue. I have compiled QEMU on Mac OS 10.12 and didn't experience any issues. The compiler used was Apple's clang.

The exact commit that causes this problem is this:

commit 770c2fc7bb70804ae9869995fd02dadd6d7656ac
tcg/i386: Add vector operations
