Regressions on arm926 target with some GCC tests

Hi,

After trying qemu master:
commit 474f3938d79ab36b9231c9ad3b5a9314c2aeacde
Merge: 68d7ff0 14f5d87
Author: Peter Maydell <email address hidden>
Date: Fri Jun 21 15:40:50 2019 +0100

even with the fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1834496,
I've noticed several regressions compared to qemu-3.1 when running the GCC testsuite, with GCC configured to generate arm10tdmi code by default, and using qemu's --cpu arm926.

I'm attaching a tarball containing one of the GCC tests (binaries), needed shared libs, and a short script to run the test.

This was noticed with GCC master configured with
--target arm-none-linux-gnueabi
--with-cpu arm10tdmi
--with-fpu vfp

Thanks
