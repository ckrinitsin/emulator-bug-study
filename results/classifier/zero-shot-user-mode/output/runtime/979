s390x floating point conversion functions broken
Description of problem:
While collecting additional reference files for float_convs (and float_convd) I noticed that the s390x handling of some cases is broken. See diff for details:

```
 diff -y tests/tcg/s390x-linux-user/float_convs.out ../../tests/tcg/s390x/float_convs.ref
#
