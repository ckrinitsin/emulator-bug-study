Emulation of a math function fails for m68k Linux user mode

Please check the attached math-example.c file.
When running the m68k executable under QEMU, it results in an "Illegal instruction" error.
Other targets don't produce this error.

Steps to reproduce the bug:

1. Download the math-example.c attached file.
2. Compile it by running:
        m68k-linux-gnu-gcc -O2 -static math-example.c -o math-example-m68k -lm
3. Run the executable with QEMU:
        /build/qemu-5.0.0/build-gcc/m68k-linux-user/qemu-m68k math-example-m68k 

The output of execution is:
        Profiling function expm1f():
        qemu: uncaught target signal 4 (Illegal instruction) - core dumped
        Illegal instruction (core dumped)

Expected output:
        Profiling function expm1f():
          Elapsed time: 47 ms
          Control result: 71804.953125
