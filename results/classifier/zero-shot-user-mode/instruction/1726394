Passes through prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, address)

qemu-user passes through prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, address) unmodified, but the third argument is an address to a BPF filter, causing an EFAULT. Now, the filter is architecture-specifc, so you can't just rewrite the addresses, so the safest bet is to just return an error here.

I guess you should just return EINVAL, but not sure. I'd really like something that can be identified, so seccomp errors can be ignored when it's not supported.
