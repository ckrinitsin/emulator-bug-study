Invalid assertion in arm_read_memory_func

Hi,

I think there is an invalid assertion in arm_read_memory_func:
assert(info->endian == BFD_ENDIAN_LITTLE)

I face it in the following use case: target armeb-linux (I use qemu user mode), -d in_asm -cpu any.

At some point during program startup, glibc's _dl_new_object calls strlen, which is written in thumb2 mode (armv6t2). So print_insn_arm() calls arm_read_memory_func() with length==2, and info->flags == INSN_ARM_BE32, and the assert is false.

If I remove the assert, execution continues OK.

With the assert, I get the error message from the assert, and qemu then stalls.

Can you confirm the assert can be removed? Or if not, explain me how to avoid/fix the subsequent qemu stall?

Thanks
