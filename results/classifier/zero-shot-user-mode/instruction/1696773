golang calls to exec crash user emulation

An example program can be found here:

https://github.com/willnewton/qemucrash

This code starts a goroutine (thread) and calls exec repeatedly. This works ok natively but when run under ARM user emulation it segfaults (usually, there are occasionally other failures).
