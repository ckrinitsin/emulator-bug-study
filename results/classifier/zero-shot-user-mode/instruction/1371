x86 BLSMSK semantic bug
Description of problem:
The result of instruction BLSMSK is different with from the CPU. The value of CF is different.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile this code
```
void main() {
    asm("mov rax, 0x65b2e276ad27c67");
    asm("mov rbx, 0x62f34955226b2b5d");
    asm("blsmsk eax, ebx");
}
```
2. Execute and compare the result with the CPU.
    - CPU
        - CF = 0
    - QEMU
        - CF = 1
