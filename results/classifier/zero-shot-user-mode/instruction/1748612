qemu-user option -strace -D <file> doesn't work

I have been trying to access qemu -strace output from a script
The main problem was it was on stderr, the strace output was merged with my program's stderr output.
Then I tried to use the -D option, to log the output to a file.
This didn't work even if the log file was created, but it was empty.

I have looked at the source code and found the print function was not qemu_log with -strace but gemu_log (to be clear it was GEMU NOT QEMU)


I have then replaced all gemu_log by qemu_log removed declaration of gemu_log and recompiled, it seems to works just fine right now.

removed declaration here and here:
