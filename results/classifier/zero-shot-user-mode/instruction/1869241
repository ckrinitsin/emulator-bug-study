svn checkout fails with E000075 "Value too large for defined data type"

I try to autobuild for ARM7 with qemu-arm-static. Part of this is downloading source via SVN.

Whenever I try to download a SVN repository I get the following output:

    svn: E000075: Can't read directory '...': Value too large for defined data type

qemu-arm-static version is 4.2.0

I've also tried older versions without change.

Platform I try to emulate is armv7h (Arch Linux ARM for Raspberry Pi 2)

Host system is AMD64

This can be reproduced 100% of the time. Here I have the issue happening on Travis CI:
