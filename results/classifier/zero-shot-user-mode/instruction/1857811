qemu user static binary seems to lack support for network namespace.

Whenever I execute emerge in gentoo linux in qemu-aarch64 chroot, I see the following error message.

Unable to configure loopback interface: Operation not supported

If I disable emerge's network-sandbox which utilizes network namespace, the error disappears.
