aarch64 BICS instruciton doesn't set flags

When reading the source for translate-a64.c here:

https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/a466dd084f51cdc9da2e99361f674f98d7218559/target/arm/translate-a64.c#L4783

I noticed that it does not appear to call gen_logic_CC for the BICS instruction so is not setting the flags as required. I haven't tried to produce a test case for it but it seems like it might be a bug.
