Unstable Win10 guest with qemu 3.1 + huge pages + hv_stimer

Host:
Gentoo linux x86_64, kernel 4.20.1
Qemu 3.1.0 
CPU: Intel i7 6850K
Chipset: X99

Guest:
Windows 10 Pro 64bit (1809)
Machine type: pc-q35_3.1
Hyper-V enlightenments: hv_stimer,hv_reenlightenment,hv_frequencies,hv_vapic,hv_reset,hv_synic,hv_runtime,hv_vpindex,hv_time,hv_relaxed,hv_spinlocks=0x1fff
Memory: 16GB backed by 2MB huge pages

Issue:
Once guest is started, log gets flooded with:

qemu-system-x86_64: vhost_region_add_section: Overlapping but not coherent sections at 103000

or 

qemu-system-x86_64: vhost_region_add_section:Section rounded to 0 prior to previous 1f000

(line endings change)

and as time goes guest loses network access (virtio-net-pci) and general performance diminishes to extent of freezing applications.

Observations:
1) problem disappears when hv_stimer is removed
2) problem disappears when memory backing with huge pages is disabled
3) problem disappears when machine type is downgraded to pc-q35_3.0
