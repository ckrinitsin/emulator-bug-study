Resizable BAR (ReBAR) support on VFIO
Additional information:
Currently `vfio_add_ext_cap()` doesn't pass ReBAR support option to VFIO.

There was a report that removing the line you see below makes it boot, but the system is not stable.
Needs investigation.

```        switch (cap_id) {
        case 0: /* kernel masked capability */
        case PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_SRIOV: /* Read-only VF BARs confuse OVMF */
        case PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_ARI: /* XXX Needs next function virtualization */
        case PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_REBAR: /* Can't expose read-only */
            trace_vfio_add_ext_cap_dropped(vdev->vbasedev.name, cap_id, next);
