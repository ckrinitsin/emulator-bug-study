Support VDI (Virtualbox) snapshots

Please support Snapshots in VDI images.

It seems that VirtualBox uses a snapshot for any changes to the main system disc. Even when the user does not create a snapshot. 

So if I want to mount a VDI disc with the recent system changes, I have to mount the Snapshot.

Thanks
