SELinux is preventing some qemu-kvm operations on CentOS Stream 9
Description of problem:
Some operations are being denied by SELinux.

First it was read access on file max_map_count, then open and getattr access on /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count (same file but with full path).

All have been fixed by creating and applying a semodule with the TE policy shown on "Additional Information" below.

```
Steps to reproduce:
1. On a CentOS Stream 9 system with a selinux enforced, create a VM and install an OS with cockpit or with virt-install.    
        - example with virt-install:    
                  `virt-install --connect qemu:///system --os-variant centos-stream9 --reinstall ipa03 --wait -1 --location  /mnt/CentOS-Stream9.iso`
2. Check the SELinux logs, either on cockpit or on /var/log/messages
Additional information:
TE module that solved the issue, created with `ausearch -c 'qemu-kvm' --raw | audit2allow -M my-qemukvm`

```
module my-qemukvm 1.1;

require {
        type sysctl_vm_t;
        type svirt_t;
        class file { getattr open read };
}

#============= svirt_t ==============

#!!!! This avc is allowed in the current policy
allow svirt_t sysctl_vm_t:file read;
allow svirt_t sysctl_vm_t:file { getattr open };
```
