sbrk() not working under qemu-user with a PIE-compiled binary?

In Debian unstable, we recently switched bash to be a PIE-compiled binary (for hardening). Unfortunately this resulted in bash being broken when run under qemu-user (for all target architectures, host being amd64 for me).

$ sudo chroot /srv/chroots/sid-i386/ qemu-i386-static /bin/bash
bash: xmalloc: .././shell.c:1709: cannot allocate 10 bytes (0 bytes allocated)

bash has its own malloc implementation based on sbrk():
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/tree/lib/malloc/malloc.c

When we disable this internal implementation and rely on glibc's malloc, then everything is fine. But it might be that glibc has a fallback when sbrk() is not working properly and it might hide the underlying problem in qemu-user.

This issue has also been reported to the bash upstream author and he suggested that the issue might be in qemu-user so I'm opening a ticket here. Here's the discussion with the bash upstream author:

You can find the problematic bash binary in that .deb file:
http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20180206T154716Z/pool/main/b/bash/bash_4.4.18-1_i386.deb

The version of qemu I have been using is 2.11 (Debian package qemu-user-static version 1:2.11+dfsg-1) but I have had reports that the problem is reproducible with older versions (back to 2.8 at least).

Here are the related Debian bug reports:
https://bugs.debian.org/889869
https://bugs.debian.org/865599

It's worth noting that bash used to have this problem (when compiled as a PIE binary) even when run directly but then something got fixed in the kernel and now the problem only appears when run under qemu-user:
