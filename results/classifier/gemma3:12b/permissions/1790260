binfmt support not working for x86 host and x86_64 guest

this is a problem in the qemu-binfmt-conf.sh script and maybe somewhere else. the version i checked is the current github mirror https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/scripts/qemu-binfmt-conf.sh

i am running linux mint 19 32bit on a 32bit x86 cpu and i want to run some applications that are only available as x86_64 packages. i use multiarch and qemu and it works for simple applications like cacafire. however i want to run the application natively from the shell without having to use qemu-x86_64 <path>. i also installed the binfmt-support package. when i run update-binfmts --display then an extry for x86_64 is missing and transparent execution is not working. 

the problem seems to be in the qemu-binfmt-conf.sh script. it disables the creation of entries for cpus of the same family. this is not a problem if you are using a 64bit cpu because 32bit binaries run on it natively but it doesnt work in the opposite way. hacking line 310 to

         if [ "$cpu" = "x86_64" ] || [ "$host_family" != "$family" ] ; then

and running it with the --systemd ALL parameter causes a x86_64 config file to be created. it still doesnt work but that might have different causes.
