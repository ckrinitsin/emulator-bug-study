Random errors when emulating armv7 and using dh

Howdy,
I'm encountering random errors when using qemu to cross-package my project using dh. In previous iterations of my project it would only fail once every two attempts. Now it fails every time.

Example error included.



If you'd like to try and replicate this error, a version of my project is publicly available with simple instructions on how to package it (using qemu) here:
