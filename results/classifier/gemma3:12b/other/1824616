Build succeeds despite flex/bison missing

I just built qemu using a fresh install, and "make" would report success despite messages of "flex: command not found" and "bison: command not found".

I didn't notice any errors, but I don't know whether that's because there's a workaround in case the tools aren't there, or because I didn't exercize the code paths that would fail.
