fr-ca keymap is wrong

The fr-ca keymap has tons of wrong keys in it, it affects other projects using Qemu/KVM like Xen.
Documentation about how to make a keymap is too vague to allow me to make something useful to send a patch, I was however able to make something which at least allows me to use important keys like dot and slash, I will attach it for reference.
