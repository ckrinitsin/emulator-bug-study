High bit(s) sometimes set high on rcvd serial bytes when char size < 8 bits

I *believe* (not confirmed) that the old standard PC serial ports, when configured with a character size of 7 bits or less, should set non-data bits to 0 when the CPU reads received chars from the read register.  qemu doesn't do this.

Windows 1.01 will not make use of a serial mouse when bit 7 is 1.  The ID byte that the mouse sends on reset is ignored.  I added a temporary hack to set bit 7 to 0 on all incoming bytes, and this convinced windows 1.01 to use the mouse.

note 1:  This was using a real serial mouse through a passed-through serial port.  The emulated msmouse doesn't work for other reasons.

note 2:  The USB serial port I am passing through to the guest sets non-data bits to 1.  Not sure if this is the USB hardware or linux.

note 3:  I also needed to add an -icount line to slow down the guest CPU, so that certain cpu-sensitive timing code in the guest didn't give up too quickly.
