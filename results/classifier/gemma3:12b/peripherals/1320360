usb passthrough not working anymore

Hi,

I'm using qemu 2.0.0 with opensuse 13.1 x84_64 bit as host and window7 as guest. Til qemu version 1.6.2 USB passthrough works perfectly, but starting with qemu 2.0.0 passthrough stop working. I can still add the usb device but when I start the guest following message appears:

"unable to execute QEMU command 'device_add': 'usb-host' is not a valid device model name"

Then the guest will not start.

I try it with different usb devices (iphone, stick, hdd), always the same error.

Are there any news / hints about this ?

Regards

Martin
