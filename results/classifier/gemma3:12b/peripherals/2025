Can't make the touchscreen work in Windows VM, device virtio-multitouch-pci not starting
Description of problem:
I tried the multitouch on qemu 8, by adding "-device virtio-multitouch-pci" to the qemu cmd line
I could make the multitouch work for an Ubuntu VM, but not for a Windows VM
Last version of Virtio drivers are installed in Windows.

Here are the issues i can see in windows :
