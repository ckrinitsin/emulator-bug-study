Error 0x5D in Qemu for Windows 

The reason to use qemu for Windows is that the mouse in emulated Windows works well while it is unusable in  qemu at Ubuntu. 
Alternative solution/bug is mouse usability in qemu for Linux.
Well-known issue of error 0x5D when booting Win 7 x64 on qemu without kvm, marked as resolved at Linux.

Used qemu for Windows downloaded from http://qemu.weilnetz.de/
Tested on  qemu 2.3.94 64-bit and  qemu 2.4.0 32-bit.
