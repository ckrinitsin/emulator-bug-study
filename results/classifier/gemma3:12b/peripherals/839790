-usbdevice tablet broken on win XP client

I'm using the qemu-kvm package from arch (not the qemu package), and on prior versions of qemu-kvm I was able to use -usbdevide tablet without problems.  The absolute mouse position is great...  With current version of qemu-kvm, when I use -usbdevice tablet, I got no mouse at all.  As my client is windows XP, it's not good to try do anything without mouse, :-)

I searched in current bugs, and didn't find any bug which subject included "tablet", so I'm submitting this bug...

Current qemu-kvm package in arch I'm using is:

% pacman -Ss qemu-kvm
extra/qemu-kvm 0.15.0-2 [installed]
    Latest KVM QEMU is a generic and open source processor emulator which achieves a good emulation speed by using dynamic translation.

Please notice I do not get any error, just the mouse broken...

thanks,

Javier.
