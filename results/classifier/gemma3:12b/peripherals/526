MacBook German Keyboard <> and ^Â° Key not working
Description of problem:
Using a German keyboard on my 2018 MacBook Pro I can't type the <> Key or the ^ Key. 
When pressing the <> Key it gets interpreted as the ^ Key, the ^ Key is dead.

Problem is not caused by the guest system, Ubuntu VMs also can't type <>. (Ubuntu VMs ran inside UTM, which internally uses QEMU. https://mac.getutm.app/ )

VirtualBox maps the <> Key and ^ Key correctly.
Steps to reproduce:
0. Use a MacBook with a German Keyboard
1. Install TempleOS
2. Install German Keyboard Layout from https://github.com/Rion96/GKey (mount the ISO as a CD Drive)
3. Every key works except for <> and ^.
Additional information:
Doing the same steps in VirtualBox results in <> and ^ working, so it must be a QEMU error.
