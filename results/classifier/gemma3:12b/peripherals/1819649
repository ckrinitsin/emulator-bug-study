Win10 Preview Build 18351 - no input

The issue exists in both 2.12.1 and current master (built 8.3.2019). Neither keyboard nor mouse input seems to work and there's no cursor available (VNC, SPICE, SDL tested). If all the 'hv_*' flags are removed input works again.

In the attachments you can find a simple script to reproduce it (requires the ISO path to be changed).
