install Centos7 or fedora27 on qemu on windows8.1

Hello,
I have tried to install CentOs or Fedora27 on my Windows8 using QEMU. I work on notepad with 4GB.
Unfortunatly, my touchpad nor my usb-mouse are not recognise on the graphical installation of CentOs and Fedora installation. So, I cannot install them.
Here are the commands I use for installation :

qemu-img create -f qcow2 fedora27b2_hd.qcow2 80G

qemu-system-x86_64 -k fr -hda fedora27b2_hd.qcow2 -cdrom Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-27_Beta-1.5.iso -m 512 -boot d

I have tried to add the option : -device usb-mouse  but, I got the error message that no 'usb-bus' found for the usb-mouse device.

What is wrong ?  QEMU or my installation command ?

Thank, BRgds,
Laurent
