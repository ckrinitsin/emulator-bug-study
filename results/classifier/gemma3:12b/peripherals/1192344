qemu crashes on unaligned extended disk reads

When performing a BIOS extended disk read (INT 13H, AH=0x42), if the offset of the buffer destination in the DAP (disk address packet) is not dword-aligned (i.e. a multiple of 4), SeaBIOS attempts to execute code at non-mapped address 0xb4f53, causing QEMU to crash. I imagine it's a bug in the BIOS code, but it does cause QEMU to crash.

QEMU version: 1.4.0 (Debian 1.4.0+dfsg-1expubuntu4) (from Ubuntu repository)
SeaBIOS version: 1.7.2-20130119_170942-roseapple
command line: qemu-system-x86_64 -m 64 -hda hda.img -monitor stdio
CPU: Intel Core i7 CPU M620 on a Dell Latitude E6410
OS: Ubuntu, GNU/Linux 3.8.0-25-generic, 64-bit
