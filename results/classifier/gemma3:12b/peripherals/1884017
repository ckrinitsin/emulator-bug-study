Intermittently erratic mouse under Windows 95

The mouse works fine maybe 75-80% of the time, but intermittently (every 20-30 seconds or so), moving the mouse will cause the pointer to fly around the screen at high speed, usually colliding with the edges, and much more problematically, click all the mouse buttons at random, even if you are not clicking. This causes random objects on the screen to be clicked and dragged around, rendering the system generally unusable.

I don't know if this is related to #1785485 - it happens even if you never use the scroll wheel.

qemu version: 5.0.0 (openSUSE Tumbleweed)

Launch command line: qemu-system-i386 -hda win95.qcow2 -cpu pentium2 -m 16 -vga cirrus -soundhw sb16 -nic user,model=pcnet -rtc base=localtime

OS version: Windows 95 4.00.950 C

Setup notes: In order to make Windows 95 detect the system devices correctly, after first install you must change the driver for "Plug and Play BIOS" to "PCI bus". I have already done this in the above image.
