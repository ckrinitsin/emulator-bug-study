kvm hangs occasionally when switching out of the qemu console

To recreate (although this does *NOT* fail most of the time alas):

1) press "ctrl-alt-2" to switch to the qemu console.
2) type say "sendkey ctrl-alt-f1"
3) press "ctrl-alt-1".

Expected outcome: Switch to tty1 in the VM.

Actual outcome: No switch to tty1 in the VM. and qemu console unresponsive to any keyboard input.


Rather a vague problem description I'm afraid but this has happened to me 3 times recently. No crash and no excessive CPU is observed.

I'll grab an strace when it happens again and attach...
