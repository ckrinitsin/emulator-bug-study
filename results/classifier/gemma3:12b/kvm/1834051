IRQ2 ignored under KVM when using IOAPIC

When using KVM, and an OS that supports the IOAPIC, interrupts mapped on IRQ2 (for instance, routing an HPET timer on interrupt 2) will cause the interrupts to never be delivered. This is because QEmu, when setting up the KVM interrupt routes, will not set one up for IRQ2[0]. When running without KVM, IRQ2 is identity-mapped to GSI2.

My understanding is that IRQs should be identity mapped to their equivalent GSI unless a redirection entry is present in the MADT. This is supported by ACPI 6.2 spec[1], 5.2.12.5 Interrupt Source Override Structure, which claims: "It is assumed that the ISA interrupts will be identity-mapped into the first I/O APIC sources.".

I stumbled across this while working on my own custom OS, got very confused why the HPET wasn't triggering any interruption - and even more confused why the behavior only happened in KVM and not in non-KVM.
