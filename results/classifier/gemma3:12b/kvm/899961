qemu/kvm locks up when run 32bit userspace with 64bit kernel

Applies to both qemu and qemu-kvm 1.0, but only when kernel is 64bit and userspace is 32bit, on x86.  Did not happen with previous released versions, such as 0.15.  Not all guests triggers this issue - so far, only (32bit) windows 7 guest shows it, but does that quite reliable: first boot of an old guest with new qemu (or qemu-kvm), windows finds a new CPU and suggests rebooting - hit "Reboot" and in a few seconds it will be locked up (including the monitor), with 100% CPU usage.  Killable with -9.
