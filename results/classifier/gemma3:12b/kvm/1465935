kvm_irqchip_commit_routes: Assertion `ret == 0'	failed

Several my QEMU instances crashed, and in the  qemu log, I can see this assertion failure, 

   qemu-system-x86_64: /build/buildd/qemu-2.0.0+dfsg/kvm-all.c:984: kvm_irqchip_commit_routes: Assertion `ret == 0' failed. 

The QEMU version is 2.0.0, HV OS is ubuntu 12.04, kernel 3.2.0-38. Guest OS is RHEL 6.3.
