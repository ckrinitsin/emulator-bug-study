cpu_address_space_init fails with assertion

qemu-system-arm does not start with version >= 2.6 and KVM enabled.

  cpu_address_space_init: Assertion `asidx == 0 || !kvm_enabled()' failed.

Hardware is Odroid XU4 with Exynos with 4.9.61+ Tested with Debian Stretch (9) or Buster (10).

Without KVM it is running fine but slow. I'm operating Debian Jessie with qemu 2.1 for a long time with KVM virtualization working flawlessly. When I upgraded to Stretch I ran into the trouble described before. I tried Debian Stretch and Buster with all Kernels provided by the Board manufacturer (Hardkernel).

It seems to be related to the feature introduced in Version 2.6:
https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/2.6
- Support for a separate EL3 address space

KVM is enabled, so I assume the adress space index asidx to be causing the assert to fail.

dmesg | grep -i KVM

Full command line is:
qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a15 -smp 2 -m 512 -cpu host -enable-kvm -kernel vmlinuz -initrd initrd.gz -dtb vexpress-v2p-ca15-tc1.dtb -device virtio-blk-device,drive=inst-blk -drive file=PATHTOFILE,id=inst-blk,if=none,format=raw -append "vga=normal rw console=ttyAMA0" -nographic

Is there anything to do to understand, if this is a hardware related failure or probably just a missing parameter?
