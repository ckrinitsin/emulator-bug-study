KVM Win 10 guest pauses after kernel upgrade



Hello!
Unfortunately the bug has apparently reappeared. I have a Windows 10 running in a VM, which after my today's "apt upgrade" goes into pause mode after a few seconds of running time.

Until yesterday it used to work and I was able to boot the VM. During the kernel update (from 5.4.0-28.33 to 5.4.0-29.34) the VM was active and then went into pause mode. Even after a reboot of my host system the problem still persists: the VM boots for a few seconds and then switches to pause mode.


Kind regards,
   Andreas
