Please add a configurable for disabling, or by default disable, KVM_X86_QUIRK_IGNORE_GUEST_PAT on Intel host CPU
Additional information:
I am not familiar with QEMU code base or much programming in general. I did a quick grep through the latest QEMU sources pulled from this repository for the string `KVM_X86_QUIRK_IGNORE_GUEST_PAT`. It does not seem to occur anywhere which makes me think its existence and effect on QEMU users has gone unnoticed.

If there is a handling of this flag which I have not noticed in the QEMU source code or documentation please guide me to where I can read about and probably configure it.

Thank you.
