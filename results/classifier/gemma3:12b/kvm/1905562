Guest seems suspended after host freed memory for it using oom-killer

Host: qemu 5.1.0, linux 5.5.13
Guest: Windows 7 64-bit

This guest ran a memory intensive process, and triggered oom-killer on host.  Luckily, it killed chromium.  My understanding is this should mean qemu should have continued running unharmed.  But, the spice connection shows the host system clock is stuck at the exact time oom-killer was triggered.  The host is completely unresponsive.

I can telnet to the qemu monitor.  "info status" shows "running".  But, multiple times running "info registers -a" and saving the output to text files shows the registers are 100% unchanged, so it's not really running.

On the host, top shows around 4% CPU usage by qemu.  strace shows about 1,000 times a second, these 6 lines repeat:

In the monitor, "info irq" shows IRQ 0 is increasing about 1,000 times a second.  IRQ 0 seems to be for the system clock, and 1,000 times a second seems to be the frequency a windows 7 guest might have the clock at.

Those fd's are for: (9) [eventfd]; [signalfd], type=STREAM, 4 x the spice socket file, and "TCP localhost:ftnmtp->localhost:36566 (ESTABLISHED)".

Because the guest's registers aren't changing, it seems to me like monitor thinks the VM is running, but it's actually effectively in a paused state.  I think all the strace activity shown above must be generated by the host.  Perhaps it's repeatedly trying to contact the guest to inject a new clock, and communicate with it on the various eventfd's, spice socket, etc.  So, I'm thinking the strace doesn't give any information about the real reason why the VM is acting as if it's paused.

I've checked "info block", and there's nothing showing that a device is paused, or that there's any issues with them.  (Can't remember what term can be there, but a paused/blocked/etc block device I think caused a VM to act like this for me in the past.)


Is there something I can provide to help fix the bug here?

Is there something I can do, to try to get the VM running again?  (I sadly have unsaved work in it.)
