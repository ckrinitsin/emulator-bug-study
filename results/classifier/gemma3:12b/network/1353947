Hypervisor with QEMU-2.0/libvirtd 1.2.2 stack when launching VM with CirrOS or Ubuntu 12.04

The issue observed when running an hypervisor with QEMU 2.0/libvirtd 1.2.2
The VM network interface is attached to a PCI virtual function (SR-IOV).

When we ran VM with guest OS CirrOS or Ubuntu 12.04 we observed an hipervisor hang shortly after the VM is loaded
We observed the same issue with Mellanox NIC and with Intel NIC

Weâ€™ve tried few combinations of {GuestOS}X{Hypervisor} and we got the following findings:
When a hypervisor is running QEMU 1.5/libvirtd 1.1.1 - no issue observed
When a hypervisor is running QEMU 2.0/libvirtd 1.2.2 - CirrOS and Ubuntu 12.04 guest OSes caused hypervisor hang
When a hypervisor is running QEMU 2.0/libvirtd 1.2.2 - CentOS 6.4 and Ubuntu 13.10 - no issue observed

The problematic guest OSes are with kernel versions ~3.2.y
