Broken tap networking on macOS host

Building QEMU with GLib newer than 2.58.3 corrupts tap networking. 
Tap device was provided by Tun/Tap kernel extension installed from brew:
  brew install tuntap

Checked revisions:
  553032d (v5.2.0)
  6d40ce0 (v6.0.0-rc1)

Host:
 MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)
 macOS Catalina 10.15.6 (19G2021)

Guest:
  Linux Ubuntu 4.4.0-206-generic x86_64
  Also tested macOS Catalina 10.15.7 as a guest, the behaviour is the same.

QEMU command line:

qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -drive file=hdd.qcow2,if=virtio,format=qcow2 \
  -m 3G \
  -nic tap,script=tap-up.sh

tap-up.sh:
 
 #!/bin/sh

 TAPDEV="$1"
 BRIDGEDEV="bridge0"

 ifconfig "$BRIDGEDEV" addm "$TAPDEV"

Enabling/disabling Hypervisor.Framework acceleration (`-accel hvf`) has no effect. 

How to reproduce: 
  1. Build & install GLib > 2.58.3 (tested 2.60.7, 2.60.7)
  2. Build qemu-system-x86_64 with GLib > 2.58.3
  3. Boot any guest any guest with tap networking enabled
  4. See that the external network is inaccessible

Hotfix:
  1. Build & install GLib 2.58.3
  2. Build qemu-system-x86_64 with GLib 2.58.3
  3. Boot any guest with tap networking enabled
  4. See that the external network is accessible, everything is working as expected
