qemu hangs on start with a bridged NIC
Description of problem:
qemu hangs on start with a bridged NIC. And there is no difference exists the bridge or not. At the same with a user NIC (`-nic user`) everything works flawlessly. Also I tried to add `-enable-kvm` key and had no luck.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run qemu with the specified command line.
Additional information:
I ran the strace: `strace -s 1024 -tt -ff -y -o qemu_bridge -- qemu-system-x86_64 -nic bridge`
