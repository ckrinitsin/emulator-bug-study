Failed to create COM port in Windows Guest VM

Hi,

Tried to establish virtual serial connection between two Windows Guest VMs(Windows 2008 Server).

As it mentioned under the link,
http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/WindowsGuestDrivers/UpdatedGuestDebugging

Started VM using the below command with serial device as TCP port.
# qemu-system-x86_64 -smp 1 -enable-kvm -m 512 -boot c -serial tcp:127.0.0.1:50001,server,nowait -hda /mnt/sda5/var/lib/libvirt/images/win2008host.img

And started WinDbg in the Windows VM, with serial port:COM1 and Baudrate:115200.

It throws the error "Could not start kernel debugging using com:port:COM1,baudrate:115200 parameters, Win32 error 0n2. The system cannot find the file specified."

Checked under Device Manager and there is no COM1 port.
Does the -serial tcp:127.0.0.01:50001 creates COM1 port? I doubt.
If no what are the parameters I should pass to WinDbg for serial port?

Please help me how to solve this issue.

Thanks
Venkatesh
