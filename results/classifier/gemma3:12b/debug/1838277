qemu-system-aarch64: regression in 3.1: breakpoint instructions always routed to EL_D even when current EL is higher

Affects 3.1.0 (latest stable release) and latest commit (893dc8300c80e3dc32f31e968cf7aa0904da50c3) but did *not* affect 2.11 (qemu from bionic ubuntu LTS).

With the following code and shell commands:

test.s:

.text
mov x0, #0x60000000
msr vbar_el2, x0
dsb sy
isb sy

$ aarch64-none-elf-as test.s -o test.o
$ aarch64-none-elf-objcopy -S -O binary test.o test.bin
$ qemu-system-aarch64 -nographic -machine virt,virtualization=on -cpu cortex-a57 -kernel test.bin -s -S

vbar_el2 is still 0 after the code, instead of being the expected 0x60000000. (see screenshot).

This regression doesn't seem to happen for vbar_el1 & virtualization=off.
