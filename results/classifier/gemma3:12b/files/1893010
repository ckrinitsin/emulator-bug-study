qemu linux-user doesn't support OFD fcntl locks

"Open file description locks (non-POSIX)", as they are described in fcntl(2) man page, aren't supported by qemu-user  and attempting to use those results in EINVAL. I'm on Gentoo with latest QEMU version currently available (5.0.0-r2), and trying to emulate ppc64 and s390x on x86_64.

Looking at linux-user/syscall.c, I'm guessing the issue is in (at least) `target_to_host_fcntl_cmd` where switch reaches the default clause as there're no cases for F_OFD_SETLK / F_OFD_SETLKW / F_OFD_GETLK.
