qed leaked clusters

There are example of two QED files which AFAIK does not have errors both. But qemu-img check say that one of them has 1 leaked cluster.

I wrote my own tool and it does not find any error. Both files attached, as well as debug output from my program.

Both files are about 4G in size after unpacking. Unpack with tar -S to handle sparse files.

And also, I know, that QED is deprecated, but anyway, seems qemu-img has bug.
