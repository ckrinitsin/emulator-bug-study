qemu loops/hangs on extending qcow2-diskspace

system is ubuntu 11-10 with qemu-kvm 0.14.1 (standard dpkg)

while trying to install a software in a winXP-guest on a nearly empty disk within a qcow2-file, qemu stops answering console and vnc.

gdb on original binary shows, that it doesn't really hang, but seems to endless loop

recompiling the binary with debugging-symbols shows following problem:

in block/qcow2-cluster.c:777 there's a loop over an allocation-list, but instead of stopping somewhere, the "next" points to the current one.
 QLIST_FOREACH(old_alloc, &s->cluster_allocs, next_in_flight) { ... }

because I'm not firm with qemu-development, I don't know, which behaviour would be correct, but simply break this loop doesn't seem to work: a few moments later the process is again at this point (tried so by setting the register for comparison to 0)

this situation is continuosly reproducible, but it always take at least 10-15min to get there, so please, if you have suggestion which I should try and report, try to give as much suggestions as possible in one action.
