qemu-arm-static crashes "segmentation fault" when running "svn checkout"

I'm not actually sure how far I can help as I so far failed to reproduce the issue on my local VM but I get it on Travis CI every time. I even went through the hassle of hacking a Debian repository into their Ubuntu Bionic VM to get qemu 4.2 as I hoped a new version could fix this.

Here is where the error occured: https://travis-ci.com/github/VDR4Arch/vdr4arch/jobs/309106220#L5420

I don't get this error with an armv7h chroot.

Maybe now I'll just try to remove all uses of svn in my build scripts...

Is it actually a viable solution to cross-build with qemu? I'm starting to doubt it...

Would it help if I manage to get this core dump out of Travis somehow (maybe make Travis push it to some GIT or upload it to my webserver)?
