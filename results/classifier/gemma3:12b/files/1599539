2.6.0: vvfat driver generates bad FAT entries

The vvfat driver sometimes generates entries about which file system checking utilities generate complaints.

For example, dosfsck will complain that the volume label entry has non-zero size. ScanDisk from Windows 9x complains about invalid dot (".") and dot-dot ("..") entries in directories and also about invalid long file name entries. MS-DOS ScanDisk also often manages to find "lost clusters" on the drive.

Tangentially: qemu-img convert fat:test test.img doesn't seem to work -- it generates an 504MiB of zero bytes and hangs. qemu-img map fat:test generates an assertion failure. Having qemu-img working might have helped with debugging the above issue.
