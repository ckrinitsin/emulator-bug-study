Can't install on Windows 10

Latest release (20190712) 64-bit doesn't install:

The setup seems to work fine at first and actually extract all the files needed for qemu in the correct location, but after it has done that, it proceeds to delete every file and leaves no trace of qemu except the installation folder.
The setup then finishes and notifies the user that it has been installed succesfully.

I downloaded the previous release and it installs correctly.
