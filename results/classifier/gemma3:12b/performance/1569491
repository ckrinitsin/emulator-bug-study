qemu system i386 poor performance on e5500 core

I had been tested with generic core net building or with mtune e5500 but i have the same result: performances 
are extremly low compared with other classes of powerpc cpu.
The strange is the 5020 2ghz in all emulators been tested by me is comparable with a 970MP 2.7 ghz in speed and benchmarks but im facing the half of performance in i386-soft-mmu compared with a 2.5 ghz 970MP.
