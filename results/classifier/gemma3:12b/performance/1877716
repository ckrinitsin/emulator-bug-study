Win10 guest unusable after a few minutes

On Arch Linux, the recent qemu package update seems to misbehave on some systems. In my case, my Windows 10 guest runs fine for around 5 minutes and then start to get really sluggish, even unresponsive. It needs to be forced off. I could reproduce this on a minimal VM with no passthrough, although my current testing setup involves an nvme pcie passthrough.

I bisected it to the following commit which rapidly starts to run sluggishly on my setup:
https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/73fd282e7b6dd4e4ea1c3bbb3d302c8db51e4ccf

I've ran the previous commit ( https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/b321051cf48ccc2d3d832af111d688f2282f089b ) for the entire night without an issue so far.

I believe this might be a duplicate of https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1873032 , although I'm not sure.
