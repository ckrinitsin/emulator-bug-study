Ubuntu's 22.04 Qemu high RAM usage (memory leak maybe)
Description of problem:
After starting/using my VM for a while, RAM fills up to the 32gb maximum, and firefox starts closing tabs and etc. This didn't happen in ubuntu 21.10 or earlier ubuntus. I've been using virt-manager + qemu for years and only had this after upgrading to ubuntu 22.04.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch virt-manager ubuntu VM with 12gb ram maximum (as an example)
2. RAM entire 32gb gets filled but nothing in gnome-system-monitor shows what is using all that RAM
3. Firefox starts closing tabs because RAM is full. Remember that only a 12gb RAM vm and firefox with a few tabs are running, and it fills all 32gb of RAM. Ram starts filling slowly and in 1 hour it fills the entire 32gb. For some reason htop shows a smaller usage, but I'm pretty sure all 32gb are being used as the computer starts freezing and almost crashing (I think swap is being used so it slows down but do not crash)
4. have to restart the computer for RAM to get normal again
