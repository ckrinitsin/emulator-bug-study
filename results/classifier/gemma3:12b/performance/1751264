qemu-img convert issue in a tmpfs partition

qemu-img convert command is slow when the file to convert is located in a tmpfs formatted partition.

It seems that the issue is caused by this commit : https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/690c7301600162421b928c7f26fd488fd8fa464e

In order to reproduce this bug :

1/ mount a tmpfs partition : mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp
2/ get a vmdk file (we used a 15GB image) and put it on /tmp
3/ run the 'qemu-img convert -O qcow2 /tmp/file.vmdk /path/to/destination' command

When we trace the process, we can see that there's a lseek loop which is very slow (compare to outside a tmpfs partition).
