aarch64-softmmu "bad ram pointer" crash

I am developing a piece of software called SimBench which is a benchmarking system for full system simulators. I am currently porting this to aarch64, using QEMU as a test platform. 

I have encountered a 'bad ram pointer' crash. I've attempted to build a minimum test case, but I haven't managed to replicate the behaviour in isolation, so I've created a branch of my project which exhibits the crash: https://bitbucket.org/Awesomeclaw/simbench/get/qemu-bug.tar.gz

The package can be compiled using:

make

and then run using:

qemu-system-aarch64  -M virt -m 512 -cpu cortex-a57 -kernel out/armv8/virt/simbench -nographic

I have replicated the issue in both qemu 2.8.1 and in 2.9.0-rc3, on Fedora 23. Please let me know if you need any more information or any logs/core dumps/etc.
