    target/i386: execute multiple REP/REPZ iterations without leaving TB
    
    Use a TCG loop so that it is not necessary to go through the setup steps
    of REP and through the I/O check on every iteration.  Interestingly, this
    is not a particularly effective optimization on its own, though it avoids
    the cost of correct RF emulation that was added in the previous patch.
    The main benefit lies in allowing the hoisting of loop invariants outside
    the loop, which will happen separately.
    
    The loop exits when the low 16 bits of CX/ECX/RCX are zero (so generally
    speaking the string operation runs in 65536 iteration batches) to give
    the main loop an opportunity to pick up interrupts.
