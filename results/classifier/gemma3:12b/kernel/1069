Qemu triggers the split lock detection of the Linux kernel
Description of problem:
Windows displays a "blue screen of death" and the Linux kernel logs this error message:

```
[  180.886150] x86/split lock detection: #AC: qemu-system-x86/10167 took a split_lock trap at address: 0x3ff2624d
[  180.946151] x86/split lock detection: #AC: qemu-system-x86/10168 took a split_lock trap at address: 0x3ff2624d
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start the guest OS
2. Do some stuff in the Windows guest (for instance OS updates)
Additional information:
Is this a bug in Windows or in Qemu ?
