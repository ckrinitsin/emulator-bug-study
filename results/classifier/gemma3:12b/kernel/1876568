"semtimedop" implementation missing in qemu?

I was trying to do an ARMv6 cross compile with qemu-user-static when I ran into this:

https://travis-ci.com/github/VDR4Arch/vdr4arch/jobs/326884620#L1596

I was close to giving up when I found the following:

https://github.com/osrf/multiarch-docker-image-generation/issues/36

Most important comment may be this one:

> The "correct" way to fix this does seem to be to implement semtimedop in qemu.

I don't know how much involved the people, discussing there, are in the qemu development but I thought it may be a good idea to bring this to your attention. If this is already fixed (I haven't found any bug about "semtimedop"), then please just close this one and tell me in which version the fix will be included.
