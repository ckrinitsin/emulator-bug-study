destination arm board hangs after migration from x86 source

The qemu destination on an arm board hangs after migration from a x86 source. With qemu emulating Arch, the migration works fine while the vm is still in the boot selection screen, but if the machine is booted, then the destination arm board vm hangs indefinitely after migrating from the x86 source. This bug does not occur the other way around, meaning a booted vm originally run on arm board will continue to work after migrating to a x86 destination.
