Win 10 bitlocker won't initialise pass-through TPM

All stock Ubuntu Zesty, Win10Pro KVM guest configured with OVMF and Q35.  My host has an ASRock Z97 Extreme 6 board with a TPM header which is populated with v1.2 complaint device.

Testing in my host the TPM device is function, I can tpm_takeownership and tpm_clear successfully and similar testing by passing the device through to a linux guest also succeeds.

However using Bitlocker in Windows 10 Pro release 1703 Windows advises it cannot "Prepare" the device which I take to mean it cannot take ownership of it.  I believe this to be related to Windows inability to view the TCG Event Log which is evidenced in the below 2 screencaps, however I'm no expert.

I've also tested the scenario with qemu 2.10 which provided the exact same results.  The only difference in the test setup is that I had to make the guest boot with SeaBios instead of OVMF.  (Windows wouldn't boot with OVMF with the boot manager giving me an error pointing to a BCD issue.  Researching this it seemed related to an old ACPI problem, I believe this unrelated to my TPM issue so will do more research and raise a separate bug for this if needed.)

Happy to provide further configurations and build logs as necessary so please advise me what is needed.

Lastly for background reading.  I've been trying to get TPM passthrough working with Windows for a long time now and have hit several different issues which I believe have been addressed by both code maturity in Qemu but also in Windows releases.  An earlier bug report can be found here (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+bug/1615722) which concludes advising me to raise this new/separate issue.

Thanks in advance,

Kelvin
