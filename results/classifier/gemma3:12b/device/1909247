QEMU: use after free vulnerability in esp_do_dma() in hw/scsi/esp.c

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the am53c974 SCSI host bus adapter emulation of QEMU. It could occur in the esp_do_dma() function in hw/scsi/esp.c while handling the 'Information Transfer' command (CMD_TI). A privileged guest user may abuse this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.

This issue was reported by Cheolwoo Myung (Seoul National University).

Original report:
Using hypervisor fuzzer, hyfuzz, I found a use-after-free issue in
am53c974 emulator of QEMU enabled ASan.

It occurs while transferring information, as it does not check the
buffer to be transferred.

A malicious guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU
process resulting in DoS scenario.

To reproduce this issue, please run the QEMU with the following command
line.

# To enable ASan option, please set configuration with the following
$ ./configure --target-list=i386-softmmu --disable-werror --enable-sanitizers
$ make

# To reproduce this issue, please run the QEMU process with the following command line
$ ./qemu-system-i386 -m 512 -drive file=./hyfuzz.img,index=0,media=disk,format=raw \
-device am53c974,id=scsi -device scsi-hd,drive=SysDisk \
-drive id=SysDisk,if=none,file=./disk.img
