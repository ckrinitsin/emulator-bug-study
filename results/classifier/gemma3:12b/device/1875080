USB host device data transfer with control endpoint

QEMU emulator version 4.2.0
Host -> Arch Linux kernel version: 5.4.34-1-lts
Guest -> Various Linux Distros

I sent a control message with data through endpoint zero.
On the other side message is received with all fields correct except data buffer.
I've tested the data field inside guest with usbmon and data field was correct but after packet leaved qemu, data filed is lost.
