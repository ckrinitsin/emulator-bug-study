qemu-system-sparc w/ SS-20 ROM does not add processors

When booting a SPARCstation-20 with the original ROM, qemu does not set the number of processors in a way that this ROM can understand it, and the ROM always reports only 1 processor installed:


 ~/qemu î‚° /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-sparc -bios ./ss20_v2.25_rom -M SS-20 -cpu "TI SuperSparc 60" -smp 2 -nographic

(It is necessary use SS-20 since it is the only sun4m model that supports 512MB RAM, and I can't get Solaris to install on the SS-20 using OpenBIOS.) 

When booting with OpenBIOS I can't seem to boot any version of Solaris though I had heard this did work.  Solaris 8 and 9 do work nicely with this ROM, but I am opening this to see if it is possible to fix this to allow the original OBP ROM to see multiple processors.
