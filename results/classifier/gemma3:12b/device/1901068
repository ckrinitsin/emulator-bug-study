Deleted tests are still run if they exist in the build tree

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a new device along with a qtest to exercise it.
2. Run make check-qtest. It passes.
3. Revert the commit that added the device and qtest.
4. Run make check-qtest again. It now fails because the device no longer exists, but the test is somehow still there even though the source files are gone and it's not mentioned in tests/qtest/meson.build.

After running make clean, make check-qtest passes again.
