K800 keyboard no longer works when attached to a VM

I use Logitech K800 keyboard which is connected to a PC through Logitech unifying receiver. In order to control my windows VM i attach unifying receiver USB device to a VM using "virsh attach-device VM-Name ./device.xml". Device ID as seen in lsusb is 046d:c52b.

As of v4.1.0 keyboard no longer works when attached to a windows VM. When attached receiver is still at least partially functional. Logitech pairing utility properly displays paired keyboard, pressing buttons on the keyboard shows changing indicator icon in pairing utility. Pairing and unpairing works. Pressing keys however fails to register any key presses.

Downgrading to v4.0.0 fixes the issue.

device.xml used to attach USB device:
```
<hostdev mode='subsystem' type='usb'>
        <source>
                <vendor id='0x046d'/>
                <product id='0xc52b'/>
        </source>
</hostdev>
