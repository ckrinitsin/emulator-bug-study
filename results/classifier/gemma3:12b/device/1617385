No snapshot possible with virtio-gpu activated

I'm using "Qemu" and "Virtual Machine Manager" on Debian-8-Stretch - both newest versions out of the Debian-testing-repository (state 26.08.2016).

If I try to save a virtual machine, it fails and I'll get the following error:

libvirtError: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command 'migrate': State blocked by non-migratable device '0000:00:02.0/virtio-gpu'

This only happens, if I chose "Virtio" as graphics-driver (no matter if I use "Spice" or "Vnc" as Server by the way). If I switch to any other driver (Cirrus, Qxl, Vga, VMvga...) there is no problem to take a snapshot and save the virtual machine.

Unfortunately "virtio-gpu" (together with "Spice-Server") is the only driver that provides proper working/running my virtual machines on my PC.
