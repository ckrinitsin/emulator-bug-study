Reading register at offset. It is not fully implemented warning make VM impossible to use

Hi,

Since this commit:
https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/bc0f0674f037a01f2ce0870ad6270a356a7a8347

We can no longer use the IOSvL2 image from Cisco. The problem is we got a lot of warning message saying:
e1000: Reading register at offset: 0x00002410. It is not fully implemented. 

User got so much of this warning that they can't use the VM. 

Thanks for the help
