USB passthrough should not fail if SET CONFIGURATION fails

QEMU's USB passthrough was not working for my new smartphone.

While analyzing the problem, I found out that a SET CONFIGURATION Request was NACKed by the USB device (probably because a SET CONFIGURATION request was already sent from the host to the device).

So I wrote a simple program to fake a successful call to libusb_set_configuration and did an LD_PRELOAD on this program before starting qemu, and it worked.

Looking at QEMU's code in host-libusb.c, I can see that QEMU does not try to claim the interface if its call to libusb_set_configuration fails.

I think QEMU should try to claim the device anyway even if libusb_set_configuration fails.

I did my tests against QEMU 2.6.2, but as I can see from the source code, this problem should happen on all versions.
