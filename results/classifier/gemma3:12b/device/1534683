no mouse cursor / qxl / windows seven guest 

Hello, 
When i'm using qxl graphic card with qemu 2.4.1 , and sdl2 client ( display ) , in a windows seven guest vm , there's no mouse cursor.
I'm using last qxl driver.

With windows8.1 , there is no problem, mouse cursor is present.

I need this to use two monitor with a windows guest, 

any suggestions are welcome,
