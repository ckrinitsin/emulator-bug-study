improve error message, when using raspi3 and RAM>4G

Running `qemu-system-aarch64 image-aarch64.iso --machine raspi3 -m 8G` prints this error message:

```
Unexpected error in visit_type_uintN() at /builddir/build/BUILD/qemu-3.0.0/qapi/qapi-visit-core.c:164:
qemu-system-aarch64: Parameter 'vcram-base' expects uint32_t
```

The problem is, that you musn't use more than 4 GB RAM for machine raspi3. As it took me some time to figure that out, I'd be glad, if you can print better error message, like you do, when using more than 4 CPU cores with machine raspi3:

```
Invalid SMP CPUs 8. The max CPUs supported by machine 'raspi3' is 4
