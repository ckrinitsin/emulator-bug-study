Dos on the fly CD image replacement is not Working with DOS

Im not able to exchange CD image on the fly (needed for some games). I messed with command like - in console(ATL+CRTL+2) eject ide1-cd0 and change ide-cd0 D:/Games/!Emulators/Dos-QEMU/ISOs/TestChangeISO.iso , but system so never able to find new CD data.. simply drive so empty.. but when i reboot virtual machine, new change image is now working.

  Qemu 4.2.
