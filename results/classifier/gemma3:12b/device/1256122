vfio bug with all no VGA card

Hello,

I whant to report to you a realy big bug.

vfio passthrough work only with VGA card ! When i try to use vfio with any other PCI or PCI-E card it does not work.

When i use vfio for VGA i can reboot (or shutdown and start again) my VM with out problem, but for any other PCI card the VM refuse to reboot.

In dmesg i have this error :

dmar: DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
dmar: DMAR:[DMA Read] Request device [xx:xx.x] fault addr 2affde000
DMAR:[fault reason 06] PTE Read access is not set

and some time the same but for Write and not Read.

I found a kind of work around but it's ugly. Just detach your devices from vfio, re-atach to his normal driver and bind again to vfio.

For information i use an Asrock Z87 Extrem 6 with a CoreI5 4570S
My kernel is 3.12 and Qemu is 1.7-rc0
