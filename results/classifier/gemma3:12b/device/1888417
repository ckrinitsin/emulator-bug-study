Latest QEMU git build on Arch linux causes PCI Passthrough host to hang on guest reboot.

Current Arch linux release, up-to-date as of 7/21/2020.

Running a windows 7 virtual machine (also happens with windows 10, possibly more OSes), with an nvidia GTX 1060 passthrough, if the VM is attempted to be restarted, either through the guest interface, or by libvirt's gui interface "Virtual Machine Manager", it hangs in a "paused" state once the VM shutsdown, and just before the reboot can take place.  A force-stop of the VM allows the VM to be properly booted without any disk error checks, alluding to a clean shutdown, but failed reboot.  The VM can be properly shutdown using the guests shutdown function, or the libvirt manager shutdown, without any hangs.  Reverting to Arch stable build QEMU 5.0.0-7 fixes the issue.
