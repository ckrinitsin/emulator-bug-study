usb_add of a Creative ZEN unrecognized in guest

Binary package hint: kvm

This happens when I add my Creative ZEN to a virtual machine running XP. The device is recognised well at first and drivers are installed correctly. But when trying to connect windows crashes with the classic blue screen It complains about something like usbohci.sys, I can't read well because it crashes too fast.
I have also tried with another virtual machine running Vista, same results.
Any help would be really appreciated!

I'm using the module kvm-amd with Ubuntu 8.04

The USB device has the following ID: 041e:4157 Creative Technology, Ltd
