Temporal freeze and slowdown while using emulated sb16

I have been carrying around this bug since previous versions and on different machines: When I use the -soundhw sb16 option, while playing any sound on the virtual machine it freezes and loops the last bit of such sound effect for 1-2 minutes, then goes back to normal speed.

Console shows:

 sb16: warning: command 0xf9,1 is not truly understood yet
 sb16: warning: command 0xf9,1 is not truly understood yet
(...)
main-loop: WARNING: I/O thread spun for 1000 iterations

-One of my emulated machines is Windows 3.11: I managed to overrun this bug by switching from the local 1.5 version of the sound blaster driver to the 1.0, although since I updated qemu it freezes that machine, so I can't test if it still works.

I am using the 1.7.90 version, but I suffered this bug for over one year

this bug happens anytime I use the -soundhw sb16 switch, but the full command I am using in this specific case is:


qemu-system-i386 -localtime -cpu pentium -m 32 -display sdl -vga cirrus -hda c.img -cdrom win95stuff.iso -net nic,model=ne2k_pci -net user -soundhw sb16
