Windows 95 guest reboots itself on qemu 1.5.0 & 1.5.50 (GIT)

When I begin to run a Windows 95 guest on these releases of qemu, it reboots itself more times without my permission (eg. without shutting it down properly), and when I'm installing Netscape 4.08 at, for example, 46% or 75%, it still reboots itself without completing the installation of the web browser. Is this an issue of main-loop.c?
