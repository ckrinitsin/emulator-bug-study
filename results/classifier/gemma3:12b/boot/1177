booting linux hangs with -cpu max or -cpu max,lpa2=off, but works with -cpu cortex-a57
Description of problem:

Steps to reproduce:
1. Snag mini.iso from http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/dists/bionic-updates/main/installer-arm64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso
2. qemu-img create ubuntu-image.img 20G
3. dd if=/dev/zero of=flash1.img bs=1M count=64
4. dd if=/dev/zero of=flash0.img bs=1M count=64
5. dd if=/home/imp/git/qemu/00-build/pc-bios/edk2-aarch64-code.fd of=flash0.img conv=notrunc
6. Run the above command
7. Select install, watch the kernel hang.
8. Change -cpu max to -cpu cortex-a57 and it will work. -cpu max,lpa2=off also exhibits the problem
Additional information:
Just grabbed git and built it with ./configure in /home/imp/git/qemu/00-build.

pm215 on irc suggested that it was an old EDK2 and a newer one is needed to cope with the newer CPU features in -cpu max
