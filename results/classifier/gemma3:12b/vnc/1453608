explain what pcsys_monitor in manpage

The specification of vnc passwords seems to have changed. `man qemu-system-x86_64` mentions `set_password` to be used in `pcsys_monitor`. Both are are not further mentioned in the man page and misteriously inexisting in both the web and the source root (as far as `grep -r -I 'pcsys_monitor' .` is concerned). That's too vage to be usable.
