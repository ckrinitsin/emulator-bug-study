Desktop background messed up when running Raring in a QEMU-based virtual machine

Screenshot attached.

Problem occurs only when choosing the default cirrus graphics card. The other graphics cards do not show this problem but are very unstable.

The screenshot is of the whole desktop with a Virtual Machine Manager window containing the desktop of the VM. You see that its actual background is messed up and also the background images which you can choose when right-clicking the background and choosing "Change Desktop Background".
