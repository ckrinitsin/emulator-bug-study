Qemu GTK interface showing question marks instead of correct strings

Qemu version: 2.6.0

When running Qemu system emulation (configured with GTK interface), all interface strings shows up as question marks instead of the correct translated strings. Tested on locale zh_CN.UTF-8.

I have attached a screenshot below for better understanding.
