Multiple (Repeating) Keystrokes in macOS

Hi,

I am finding this issue with v4.2.0, or the latest master - on a Windows host, with macOS guest. It happens using gtk (SPICE?) or VNC. When I get to a place to enter a keystroke, I quite reliably get multiple of the same key (i.e. press A, get AAAA).

Thinking there may be a basic setting to address this? I did try it in Linux (kvm), no issue there.

Thanks!
