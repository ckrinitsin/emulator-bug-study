"Zoom to fit" doesn't work  with -display gtk -vga virtio

qemu version: 2.12.1

When using -display gtk for all -vga options (std,qxl,vmware,cirrus) the option "Zoom To Fit" is unchecked and auto-resizing of the window works well; except for -vga virtio: here "Zoom To Fit" is checked and auto-resizing doesn't work.

Proposal: disable "Zoom To Fit" as default for virtio as well
