Qemu 2.6.0 freezes with windows guests

When launching qemu with the same command line as before 2.6.0, with SDL display, with virtio, for a win-10 guest:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -name win-10 -machine type=pc,accel=kvm -cpu host -smp cores=1,threads=2,sockets=1 -m 2.7G -balloon virtio -drive file=/home/<username>/.qemu/imgs/win10-coe.qcow2,index=0,media=disk,if=virtio -drive file=/usr/share/virtio/virtio-win.iso,index=1,media=cdrom -drive file=/usr/share/spice-guest-tools/spice-guest-tools.iso,index=2,media=cdrom -net nic,model=virtio -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no,vhost=on -usbdevice tablet -usb -display sdl -vga qxl -soundhw ac97 -rtc base=localtime -usbdevice host:0b0e:0032 -usbdevice host:0b0e:0348 -usbdevice host:0b0e:0410

Qemu at some point just freezes with no error message at all with newer version 2.6.0-1.

Reverting to prior version 2.5.1-1, things go back to normal.

A simple way to accelerate the freeze is to have qemu launch in a workspace/desktop, and then move to a different workspace/desktop, and then move back to the qemu workspace/desktop, and you'll find out it's frozen.

BTW, there's no way to get into qemu monitor mode terminal at all once frozen. The monitor terminal shows up, but does nothing...

Perhaps it's useful to notice that I have up to date win-10 virtio drivers for ethernet, scsi/storage, qxl-dod, balloon, and serial interface drivers. The ISO version used is 0.1.118.1 (virtio-win AUR package).

Using the standard (std) qemu video driver, rather than the qxl-dod one makes no difference BTW.

Just in case, running on up to date x86-64 Arch, plain qemu command line.
