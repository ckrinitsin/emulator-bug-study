The bug report describes an issue related to the handling of NaNs in the `fmopa` instruction within the QEMU emulator. Specifically, the 32-bit variant of this instruction does not generate default NaNs due to an invalid float_status pointer being passed. This is a problem with how the instruction is implemented in the emulator.
