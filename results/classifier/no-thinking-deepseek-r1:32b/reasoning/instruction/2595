The bug report describes an issue with the incorrect behavior of SDOT and UDOT instructions in QEMU when using 64-bit SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) vectors. The problem occurs specifically when the vector length is set to 64 or higher, leading to discrepancies between the expected results and those produced by QEMU.
