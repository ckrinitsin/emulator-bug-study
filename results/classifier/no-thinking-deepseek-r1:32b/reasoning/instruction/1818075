The issue is related to QEMU's TCG (Translation Cache Generator) not supporting certain AVX instructions when emulating a Skylake CPU. The code built with AVX2 instructions causes QEMU to hang due to unsupported features.

The problem lies in the instruction execution within the emulator, specifically handling AVX operations which are not fully supported by the current TCG implementation.
