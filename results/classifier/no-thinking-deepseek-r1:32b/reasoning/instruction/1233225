The issue described seems to be related to how floating-point division is handled when running the program under QEMU user mode for MIPS/MIPSEL architectures. The problem arises because the cross-compiled binary produces incorrect output (2.0 instead of 0.5) when executed in QEMU user mode, but works correctly in a fully emulated environment or when compiled and run natively within that environment.

This suggests there might be an issue with how the floating-point division is being handled by QEMU's user-mode emulation for MIPS/MIPSEL targets. The correct output (0.5) is achieved both when running in a full VM and when using the native compiler inside the VM, indicating that the cross-compiler itself isn't the source of the problem.

The discrepancy likely points to an issue within QEMU's handling of certain instructions or operations under user mode for these architectures. Specifically, it could involve how floating-point operations are being emulated or translated in this context.
