The issue reported involves running x86_64 binaries on an aarch64 platform using QEMU's user mode emulation, resulting in "Synchronous External Abort" errors. This type of error typically occurs during runtime when there is an unexpected hardware exception that the software doesn't handle properly.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The user is trying to run x86_64 executables on an aarch64 system using QEMU.
   - They've set up binfmt_misc to automatically use the QEMU interpreter for x86_64 binaries.
   - Running specific Intel/Dell firmware update tools within Docker containers results in kernel errors: "Synchronous External Abort."

2. **Analyzing the Error:**
   - "Synchronous External Abort" indicates a hardware exception that occurs during execution.
   - The error code (0x92000610) suggests an external abort, possibly due to an invalid memory access or instruction.

3. **Identifying the Category:**
   - This is not related to a faulty instruction (instruction category) because the issue arises from hardware exceptions during execution.
   - It's also not directly related to system calls (syscall category) but rather how the program interacts with the hardware while running.
   - Therefore, it falls under runtime errors.
