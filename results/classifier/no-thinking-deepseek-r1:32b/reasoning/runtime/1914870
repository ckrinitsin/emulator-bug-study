The issue seems to be related to the compilation process failing when trying to build QEMU on Debian unstable. The errors are occurring during the compilation of `utils.cc` from the libvixl disassembler component. 

The error messages point to problems in `/usr/include/string.h`, specifically mentioning missing binary operators and undeclared identifiers like `size_t`. This suggests that there might be a problem with the headers being used, possibly due to an outdated or incompatible version of the C library (glibc) on the system.

Looking at the system information provided:

- **OS**: Debian GNU/Linux bullseye/sid
- **C Compiler**: gcc 10.2.1
- **Linkers**: ld.bfd 2.35.1

These are up-to-date versions, so it's unlikely that the issue is with the compiler or linker directly.

The errors in `string.h` could be due to:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure that all necessary development packages (e.g., glibc-dev) are installed and up-to-date.
2. **Header File Corruption**: There might be an issue with the header files themselves. Reinstalling glibc might resolve this.
3. **Compatibility Issues**: The version of libvixl being used might not be compatible with the current glibc headers.

Steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Reinstall glibc Development Files**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install --reinstall libc6-dev
   ```
2. **Check for Updated Dependencies**:
   Ensure that all QEMU dependencies are up-to-date.
3. **Update libvixl**: Check if there's a newer version of libvixl that resolves compatibility issues with the current system.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, further investigation into specific compiler flags or patches might be necessary to align libvixl with the system's headers.
