The issue described relates to how QEMU handles the overflow condition code on the s390x architecture during subtraction operations. The problem arises because QEMU incorrectly sets the overflow bit, leading to incorrect results when using the `__builtin_sub_overflow` function. This affects both 32-bit and 64-bit integer subtractions.

The bug is part of the runtime category because it pertains to how QEMU executes instructions on the s390x architecture during runtime, specifically regarding condition code handling after subtraction operations. The incorrect setting of the overflow bit causes unexpected behavior in programs relying on accurate overflow detection.

**Answer:** runtime
