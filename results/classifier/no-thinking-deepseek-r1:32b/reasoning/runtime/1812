The problem occurs when older aarch64 programs run under qemu-aarch64 and segfault, specifically after a certain commit. The issue seems to be related to how old userspace handles recent CPU features or changes in the emulator.

Possible categories: instruction, syscall, runtime.

The error is not due to a faulty instruction or a specific syscall failure but rather due to runtime conditions where older programs are not compatible with newer qemu versions. This suggests it's a runtime issue.
