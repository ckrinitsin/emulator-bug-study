The issue occurs when using `file(1)` on an SH4 QEMU user emulator with an ELF file, resulting in "Invalid argument". Debugging shows overflown values during processing. This suggests a problem within the QEMU environment rather than with `file` itself.

**runtime**

The error happens at runtime within the QEMU emulation context when trying to read the elf file, indicating it's not related to instruction execution or syscalls but an issue in how the emulator handles certain operations.
