The issue reported is related to how QEMU emulates the FPSCR register in ARM user mode programs. Specifically, certain bits (bits[19, 14:13, 6:5]) of the FPSCR are supposed to be reserved and non-writeable according to the ARM manual, but QEMU allows these bits to be modified. This is an error in how the emulator handles the register's state.
