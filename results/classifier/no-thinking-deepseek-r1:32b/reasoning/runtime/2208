The issue reported involves the `pc` register not updating correctly when using the `-one-insn-per-tb` option with the `execlog` plugin. The problem occurs during execution where the PC value should change for each instruction but does not, leading to incorrect logging.

This is a runtime error because it happens during the normal operation of QEMU when processing instructions, affecting the correct execution flow and register updates.
