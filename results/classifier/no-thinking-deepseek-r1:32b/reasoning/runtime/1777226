The problem described involves warnings emitted by `qemu-user` that interfere with userland applications' output. The user suggests that these warnings should be directed to a log file instead of stdout/stderr.

**Category: runtime**

Reasoning:
- This is an issue related to runtime behavior, specifically how warnings are handled during the execution of QEMU.
- It doesn't pertain to faulty instructions or syscalls but rather to runtime logging and output management.
