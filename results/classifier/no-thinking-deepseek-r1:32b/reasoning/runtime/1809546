The issue described is related to how QEMU handles writes to specific registers of the PL011 UART device. When a byte is written to an offset within a register, QEMU overwrites the entire register instead of just modifying the targeted byte. This behavior causes unexpected results in the application running on QEMU.

This problem occurs during runtime when interacting with the hardware components simulated by QEMU. It's not related to instruction decoding or system calls but rather how the virtual device handles register writes.
