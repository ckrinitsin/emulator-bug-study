The issue seems to be related to memory allocation during the initialization of the guest space in QEMU. The problem occurs when trying to allocate a range for the guest, specifically failing due to an `Operation not permitted` error. This suggests that there might be restrictions or changes in how memory is being managed or mapped by the host kernel, possibly influenced by sysctl parameters like `vm.mmap_min_addr`. 

The fact that this issue started appearing after specific commits and affects certain distributions (like Arch Linux) but not others indicates it could be tied to how different kernels handle memory mappings. The varying outcomes based on `vm.mmap_min_addr` values further point towards a problem with how QEMU is interacting with the host's memory management system.

Given that the error occurs at runtime when trying to allocate memory for the guest, this seems like an issue during the execution of QEMU rather than a build-time or instruction-level problem. Therefore, it falls under runtime errors.
