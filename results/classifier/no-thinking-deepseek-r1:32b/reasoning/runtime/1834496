The issue described involves regressions when running GCC tests on an ARM target using QEMU. The problem occurs after updating to a recent version of QEMU (specifically commit 474f3938d), where previously passing tests now cause QEMU to crash with an uncaught signal 6 (Aborted). This suggests that the issue is related to how the ARM CPU or memory management is handled in the emulator.

The user provided specific configurations, including using `--cpu cortex-a9` and running tests that previously worked. The fact that the crash occurs across multiple tests points towards a systemic issue rather than an isolated bug.

Given the categories:
- **instruction**: This would apply if a specific instruction was causing issues.
- **syscall**: If system calls were failing.
- **runtime**: For other runtime errors not covered by the above.

The problem seems to stem from how QEMU handles certain operations at runtime, possibly related to CPU or memory management changes introduced in the recent commit. Therefore, the most appropriate category is **runtime**.
