The problem described involves running a binary compiled for x86_64 on an aarch64 or LoongArch host using QEMU's qemu-x86_64 emulator. The user reports that when they run the binary with `qemu-x86_64`, there is no output, and they suspect that a specific commit related to fixing the brk() system call caused this issue.

The key points here are:
1. The binary is built for x86_64 (using an x86 cross-compiler) with `--static`.
2. QEMU-x86_64 is built on an aarch64 or LoongArch host.
3. Running the binary with QEMU results in no output, which suggests that either the binary isn't executing correctly, or there's an issue with how QEMU is handling the execution.

The problem seems to relate to how the emulator interacts with the guest OS and possibly how it handles certain system calls or memory management (given the commit mentioned fixes brk()). This points towards a runtime error within QEMU when attempting to execute the binary. The issue doesn't seem to be directly about a faulty instruction in the binary itself but rather how the emulator is processing the execution.

Based on the categories provided:
- **instruction**: Doesn't apply because there's no indication of an incorrect instruction being executed.
- **syscall**: Might be related, as brk() is a system call, but the issue seems broader than just a single syscall.
- **runtime**: This fits best because the problem occurs during the runtime execution of the binary within QEMU.

Thus, the most appropriate category for this bug report is:

**runtime**
