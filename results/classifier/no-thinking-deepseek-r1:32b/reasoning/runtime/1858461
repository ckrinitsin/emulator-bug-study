The issue described involves adding a new syscall to QEMU for the MIPS architecture but encountering an `ENOSYS` error when the application tries to use it. The user has modified the `linux-user/mips/cpu_loop.c` file by adding a new syscall entry (`MIPS_SYS(sys_getdents64_x32, 3)`) and adjusting the code to handle syscalls beyond a certain number. However, the error persists because the check for valid syscalls is not correctly accounting for the new addition.

The user also notes that the MIPS `cpu_loop.c` file differs significantly from its ARM counterpart, suggesting that the MIPS implementation may need similar restructuring to properly support extended syscalls as done in the ARM version.

This issue falls under the category of a **runtime** error because it occurs during the execution of the application when attempting to use the new syscall, leading to an `ENOSYS` ( syscall not supported ) error.
