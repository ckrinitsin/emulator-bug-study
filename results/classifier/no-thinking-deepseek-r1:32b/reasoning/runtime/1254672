The issue described involves a segmentation fault when running `ps` inside a chroot environment using QEMU-static for an armhf guest on an Ubuntu Precise host. The problem arises within the `procps-ng` package, but the user suspects it might be related to QEMU due to the lack of existing bug reports for `procps`. The segmentation fault occurs during runtime when executing `ps`, which is part of the procps utilities. This suggests a runtime error specific to the interaction between the guest environment and the QEMU-static emulator.
