The issue appears to be related to memory mapping discrepancies between the emulated environment and the host system when using QEMU user-mode emulation for 32-bit ARM builds. The problem occurs when trying to access specific memory addresses that are either not mapped or incorrectly mapped in the host process, leading to errors such as "Input/output error" when reading from `/proc/self/mem`.

This issue is related to how QEMU handles memory mappings and interacts with the host system's memory management. It is a runtime error because it occurs during the execution of the program when attempting to access certain memory addresses that are not correctly handled by the emulation layer.
