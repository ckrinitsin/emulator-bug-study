The issue involves incorrect float32 arithmetic translation by `qemu-ppc (user)`. This seems to be related to how floating-point operations are emulated within QEMU, potentially involving FPU instruction handling or internal printf emulation.

**runtime**

The bug occurs during runtime when the program is executed under QEMU, leading to incorrect results.
