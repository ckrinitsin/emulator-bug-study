The issue occurs when running multi-threaded Go commands inside a Docker container using qemu-ppc64le-static for emulation. The problem is not isolated to Go but seems related to how QEMU handles multi-threaded applications in a static build environment.

When building and running `go build` without limiting the number of processes or threads, the process may hang or encounter segmentation faults. This suggests that there might be an issue with how QEMU-PPC64LE-static interacts with the host's CPU architecture when handling multiple threads simultaneously.

The problem does not occur when forcing Go to run single-threaded (`GOMAXPROCS=1 go build -p 1`), which points towards concurrency or threading as the root cause. Since this behavior is observed across different architectures (e.g., arm64 and ppc64le) using QEMU, it's likely a QEMU-related issue rather than a Go-specific problem.

After reviewing similar issues reported against QEMU, it appears that multi-threaded applications can sometimes encounter unexpected behaviors or crashes when running under certain QEMU configurations. This could be due to incorrect handling of thread scheduling, context switches, or memory management within the emulator.

Based on the analysis and error logs (especially the segmentation fault), this issue likely falls under the `runtime` category because it pertains to how the runtime environment (QEMU in this case) interacts with the application's execution.
