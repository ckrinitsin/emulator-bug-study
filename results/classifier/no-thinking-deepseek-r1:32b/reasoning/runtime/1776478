The issue seems to be related to the use of `qemu-arm-static` for cross-compiling LV2 plugins on an ARMv6 architecture (like Raspberry Pi Zero) while the code is intended for ARMv7. The error occurs when running `lv2_ttl_generator`, which is part of DISTRHO-Ports.

The classification would be **runtime**, as the problem happens during runtime execution within QEMU, specifically related to threading and mutex operations that aren't handled correctly in the cross-compilation environment.
