The issue described seems to be related to how escape sequences are handled when using the curses display in QEMU. The problem occurs specifically when using `-display curses`, where escape commands like `Ctrl + X` or `Alt + 2` do not work as expected unless pressed simultaneously with the escape key.

From the user's tests, it appears that the terminal environment (e.g., macOS Terminal vs. other clients) affects how these escape sequences are interpreted. For instance, pressing `Option + 2` in macOS Terminal sends a different sequence compared to pressing `Esc + 2`. This suggests that the issue is related to how the terminal emulator translates key presses into escape sequences.

The fact that the same commands work when using the graphical display but not with curses implies that the problem lies in how the curses interface interprets these sequences. It might be a timing issue or an interpretation issue within the curses setup.

Considering the possible categories:

1. **Instruction**: This doesn't seem to be about faulty instructions in the documentation.
2. **Syscall**: The issue isn't directly related to system calls failing.
3. **Runtime**: The problem occurs during runtime when handling escape sequences, particularly with curses.

Therefore, the most appropriate category for this bug is `runtime`.
