The issue reported involves performance regression when using `qemu-user` and `proot` on Ubuntu 18.04 compared to Ubuntu 16.04. The user is encountering significant slowdowns when executing commands within an ARM chroot environment, specifically noting that a simple `grep` command takes over 24 seconds on the newer system versus less than 0.1 seconds on the older setup.

From the details provided:

- **System Differences**: The systems differ in hardware specs (higher-end CPU and more RAM on System 1 vs. lower specs on System 2), but the performance discrepancy is far beyond what would be expected from hardware differences alone.
- **Software Versions**: On Ubuntu 16.04, `qemu-arm` version 2.10.1 (from a cloud repo) is used, while on Ubuntu 18.04, it's `qemu-arm` version 2.11.1 from the standard repository.
- **Proot Version**: Both systems use proot 5.1.0, so it's unlikely to be the cause of the issue.

The problem is likely related to changes in the QEMU implementation between versions 2.10 and 2.11 that affect performance when running user-mode emulation with `proot`. Possible areas of concern could include:

- **Emulation Overheads**: Changes in how QEMU handles system calls or emulates the ARM architecture might introduce overheads not present in earlier versions.
- **syscall Handling**: Issues in handling syscalls efficiently, leading to increased CPU usage (as seen in the user and sys times).
- **Runtime Performance Bottlenecks**: Other runtime optimizations or regressions that impact the overall execution speed.

Given these observations, the issue seems to stem from how QEMU is processing system calls or emulating the ARM environment in version 2.11.1 compared to 2.10.1. This suggests a potential problem with how syscalls are being handled in the newer version of QEMU.
