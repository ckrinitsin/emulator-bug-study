The issue reported involves Python crashing during a rebuild when using QEMU-M68k, specifically encountering an error related to the futex facility returning an unexpected error code ("Invalid argument"). The problem seems to stem from system calls (syscalls) within the futex mechanism, as evidenced by the logs showing multiple threads interacting with futex operations and resulting in errors. This suggests that there is a problem with how certain syscalls are being handled or emulated in the QEMU environment.
