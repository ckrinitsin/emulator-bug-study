The problem described involves an issue where the `faccessat2` system call (number 439) is not implemented in QEMU for the LoongArch64 architecture. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking file access permissions using `[[ -r test.sh ]]`. The error occurs during runtime and affects the functionality of user-space applications running under QEMU.
