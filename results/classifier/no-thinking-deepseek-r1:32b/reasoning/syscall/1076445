The issue described involves `qemu-i386` failing when executing a cross-compiled program that uses the `system()` function. This problem does not occur with other architectures like ARM or MIPS. The user has tried both i386 and x86_64 toolchains, both resulting in failure, while other architectures work fine.

The classification of this bug is likely related to how QEMU handles system calls on specific architectures when using a cross-compiled environment. Since the problem arises with `system()`, which invokes a shell command, it suggests an issue with how the cross-toolchain interacts with QEMU's emulation for x86 architectures. The failure could be due to missing or incorrectly implemented syscalls in QEMU's i386 and x86_64 emulators when dealing with certain system calls.

Therefore, this bug falls under the category of:

**syscall**
