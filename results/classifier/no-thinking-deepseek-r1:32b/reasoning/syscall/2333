The issue appears to be related to how VDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) handles certain system calls on armeb architecture within QEMU. The crash occurs during `__clock_gettime64()`, which is triggered by `time()` in the provided code. The problem does not occur when VDSO is disabled, suggesting that the issue lies within the handling of VDSO syscalls in QEMU for big-endian ARM.
