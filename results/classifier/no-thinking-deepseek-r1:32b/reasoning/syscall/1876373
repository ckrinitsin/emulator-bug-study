The issue described involves an unexpected segmentation fault when using `mremap` within QEMU for certain architectures (i386 and 32-bit ARM). The problem does not occur when running natively on x86_64 or when resizing to a different size, indicating it might be specific to how QEMU handles the `mremap` system call in these contexts.

**Analysis:**
- The segmentation fault occurs during the `mremap` syscall.
- It's reproducible with both i386 and 32-bit ARM emulations but not on native x86_64 or when resizing to a different size (e.g., 12288).
- Debugging with `-singlestep` confirms that the segfault happens during `mremap`.

**Conclusion:**
The issue is related to how QEMU handles the `mremap` system call for specific architectures, leading to an unexpected segmentation fault.
