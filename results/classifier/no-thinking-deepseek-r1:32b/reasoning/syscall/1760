The problem described involves incorrect decoding of system call arguments for the `_NR_mmap` ( syscall number 90) in a 32-bit environment when using `qemu-i386`. The user has provided code snippets and outputs from both native execution (`strace`) and under QEMU, showing discrepancies in how the `mmap` system call is handled. Specifically, the arguments passed to the `mmap` syscall are not being decoded correctly by QEMU.

This issue falls under the **"syscall"** category because it directly relates to an error in handling a system call within the QEMU emulator. The problem is specifically about how the arguments for the `mmap` system call are interpreted, which is essential for correct emulation of 32-bit binaries.
