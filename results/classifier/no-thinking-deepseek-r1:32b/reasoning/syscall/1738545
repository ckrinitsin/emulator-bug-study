The bug report describes an issue where Go binaries panic with "mmap errno 9" when run under QEMU's user-mode emulation (qemu-user). The problem does not occur on real hardware, suggesting it is specific to the QEMU environment.

**Analysis:**

1. **Issue Symptom:** The error occurs during the execution of a simple Go program, specifically when using `gccgo-7` to compile and run on an ARMEL system under QEMU.
2. **Error Details:** The panic message points to a problem with `mmap`, indicating that the program is unable to map memory properly in this environment.
3. **Reproducibility:** The issue consistently occurs under QEMU but works fine on real hardware, pointing towards an issue within QEMU's handling of certain operations.

**Possible Categories:**

- **Instruction:** Relates to faulty or misinterpreted instructions.
- **Syscall:** Errors during system calls, such as `mmap`.
- **Runtime:** Other runtime-related issues beyond syscalls.

**Classification:**

The error arises from a problem with the `mmap` system call within QEMU's user-mode emulation. This suggests that QEMU is not correctly handling or emulating this syscall for ARMEL targets.

**Answer:** syscall
