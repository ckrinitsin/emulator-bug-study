The issue arises because when running 32-bit user-static QEMU on a 64-bit host, the `getdents64` system call returns 64-bit inode numbers and offsets which exceed the 32-bit limits expected by the C standard in glibc's `readdir()` function. This causes `readdir()` to return `NULL` with `errno=EOVERFLOW`.
