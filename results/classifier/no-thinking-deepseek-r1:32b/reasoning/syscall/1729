The issue described involves `mremap` failing due to an overlap with the stack guard during the execution of a program that uses `pthread_getattr_np`. This problem is encountered when running 32-bit user-static on a 64-bit host using QEMU.

To classify this bug, it's important to determine where the issue originates. Since the problem arises from the behavior of the `mremap` system call and its interaction with the stack guard in QEMU, it falls under an error related to a system call rather than an instruction or runtime error specific to the application or musl-libc.

**Answer:** syscall
