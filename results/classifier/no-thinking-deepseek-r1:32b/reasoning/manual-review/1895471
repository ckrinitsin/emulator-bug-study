The bug report indicates that there's a compilation error related to C11 atomics when using Clang. The issue arises because the code is attempting to use atomic operations on variables that aren't correctly declared as `_Atomic` types.

To fix this, ensure that any variable involved in atomic operations is properly declared with the `_Atomic` qualifier. For example, if `bh->flags` is used in an atomic operation, it should be defined as `_Atomic unsigned int bh_flags;`.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```c
typedef struct {
    _Atomic unsigned int flags;
    // Other members...
} BufHeader;

// Usage:
BufHeader *bh = ...;
old_flags = atomic_fetch_or(&bh->flags, BH_PENDING | new_flags);
```

By correctly declaring the variables as `_Atomic`, Clang will recognize them for atomic operations, resolving the compilation errors.
