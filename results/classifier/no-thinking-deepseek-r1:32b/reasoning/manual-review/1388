The issue reported is about the absence of Windows installers for QEMU 7.2.0 on specific repositories. This does not directly relate to an instruction error, a syscall error, or a runtime error. Instead, it pertains to the availability of distribution files.

However, since the categories provided are limited to "instruction," "syscall," and "runtime," and none of these fit the issue described, I need to choose the closest category based on the possible interpretations.

Given that the issue is about missing installers which could be seen as a runtime problem (since it affects the installation process), I will classify it under:

**runtime**

This classification assumes that the absence of installers impacts the ability to run QEMU properly, even though it's more about distribution rather than an error during execution.
