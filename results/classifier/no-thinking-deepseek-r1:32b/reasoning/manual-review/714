The issue described relates to command-line arguments not being passed correctly when using QEMU's user-space semihosting feature. This is likely due to how QEMU handles argument passing in this mode, leading to incorrect `argc` and `argv` values.

The appropriate classification for this bug is:

**runtime**

This is because the problem occurs at runtime when the program is executed under QEMU with semihosting enabled, rather than being an issue with a specific instruction or system call.
