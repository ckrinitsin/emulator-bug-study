The issue arises because the QEMU emulator isn't correctly handling the `/proc/self/maps` file for 32-bit guests running under a 64-bit QEMU environment. Specifically, when address sanitizer (Asan) is used in such a setup, it fails to find stack boundaries, leading to an error during initialization.

Looking at the provided code snippet from `linux-user/syscall.c`, it seems that only certain architectures (like ARM and M68K) have support for writing stack information into `/proc/self/maps`. However, this functionality is missing for other targets like x86_32, which causes Asan to fail when trying to determine the stack boundaries.

This problem is not isolated; there was a previous report related to system maps not being hidden properly in QEMU. The current issue likely stems from similar root causes, where the handling of process maps isn't consistent across all architectures.

To classify this bug:

- **Instruction:** No specific instruction-level issues are mentioned.
- **Syscall:** The problem relates to how `/proc/self/maps` is handled during syscalls, particularly when Asan relies on it for stack information.
- **Runtime:** While the error occurs at runtime, the root cause is more tied to how QEMU implements certain system calls.

Given that the issue is centered around how QEMU manages the `/proc/self/maps` file and reports stack boundaries (or lack thereof), it falls under the `syscall` category because it involves errors in handling system call-related functionalities specific to process mapping.
