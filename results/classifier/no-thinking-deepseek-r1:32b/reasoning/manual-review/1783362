The bug report describes an issue where `mmap` returns success (NULL, 0) instead of failure (MAP_FAILED, -1) when len==0 in QEMU-user. This is related to how syscalls are handled in the emulator.

**syscalls**

This is a syscall error because it involves incorrect handling of the mmap system call within the QEMU environment.
