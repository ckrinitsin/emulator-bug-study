The bug report describes an issue where `shmat()` fails when running a 32-bit guest program on a 64-bit host using QEMU. The problem arises due to conflicting `mmap` flagsâ€”specifically, the initial mapping uses `MAP_PRIVATE`, and `shmat()` attempts to use `MAP_SHARED`, which is not allowed.

The issue can be classified as a **runtime** error because it occurs during the execution of the program when interacting with shared memory.
