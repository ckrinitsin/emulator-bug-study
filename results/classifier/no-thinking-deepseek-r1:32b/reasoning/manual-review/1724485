The issue reported relates to an invalid assertion within `arm_read_memory_func` when handling thumb2 mode instructions in a target environment set to armeb-linux. The error occurs because the code expects a little-endian configuration (`BFD_ENDIAN_LITTLE`), but this is not the case for the given target, leading to an assertion failure.

Upon further analysis, the problem arises during program startup where `glibc's _dl_new_object` invokes `strlen`, which is implemented in thumb2 mode. This causes `print_insn_arm()` to call `arm_read_memory_func()` with a specific set of parameters that do not meet the assertion condition.

The user has identified that removing the assertion allows execution to proceed without issues, suggesting that the assertion may be overly restrictive or incorrect for certain use cases. However, it's crucial to determine whether this assertion is necessary for other parts of the codebase and if its removal could introduce unintended side effects.

Further investigation is needed to understand why the assertion was originally placed there and whether there are alternative solutions to handle big-endian configurations properly without compromising the integrity of the code. If the assertion is not essential, it may be safe to remove it, but this should be done cautiously after thorough testing.

The user has also reported that with the assertion in place, QEMU stalls, indicating a potential runtime issue beyond just the assertion failure. This suggests that addressing the root cause of why the code expects little-endian when big-endian is being used might prevent the stall and ensure smooth execution across different configurations.

In summary, while removing the assertion seems to resolve the immediate problem for the reported use case, it's essential to explore whether this change could affect other parts of the system or if there are deeper issues in how endianness is handled in `arm_read_memory_func`.
