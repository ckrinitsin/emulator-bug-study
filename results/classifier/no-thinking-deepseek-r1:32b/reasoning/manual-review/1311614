The issue involves `qemu-arm` segfaulting when using GCC 4.9.0. The problem arose after upgrading from GCC 4.8.3 to 4.9.0 and was resolved by reverting to the older version. This suggests a compatibility issue between `qemu-arm` and GCC 4.9.0, likely related to how the compiler generates code or interacts with the emulator.

Given that the segfault occurs during runtime when running commands like `rpm`, it's not an instruction-level fault nor is it directly tied to a syscall error. Instead, it's an issue that arises during the execution of programs compiled with GCC 4.9.0 within the QEMU environment.

**runtime**

The problem falls under the "runtime" category because it occurs during the execution of software after compilation, indicating issues in how the emulator handles the code produced by the newer compiler version.
