Unsupported syscalls 370 and 355

Qemu seems to be missing syscalls 370 and 355 when running qemu usermode arm. These are used by systemd or some similar new package. This can be detected by creating an debian sid armhf with qemu debootstrap. When the system is launched with "systemd-nspawn -bD sid-arm" this happens (newest git as of today):

/etc/localtime is not a symlink, not updating container timezone.
