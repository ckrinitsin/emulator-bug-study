PowerPC64: tlbivax does not work for addresses above 4G

The tlbivax instruction in QEMU does not work for address above 4G. The reason behind this is a simple 32bit trunction of an address.
Changing the argument ea from uint32_t to target_ulong for the function booke206_invalidate_ea_tlb() in target/ppc/mmu_helper.c solves the issue.

I did not reproduce this using Linux so I have no public example for reproducing it. However it's a pretty straight forward change.

Issue can be seen in all version of QEMU.
