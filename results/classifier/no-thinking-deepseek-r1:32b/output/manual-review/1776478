Getting qemu: uncaught target signal 6 when running  lv2 plugin cross-compilation

Hey,
I am part of the Zynthian team and we use qemu-arm-static to cross compile lv2 audio plugins.

When running a compilation of DISTRHO-Ports we get:

lv2_ttl_generator: pthread_mutex_lock.c:81: __pthread_mutex_lock: Assertion `mutex->__data.__owner == 0' failed.
qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped
./scripts/generate-ttl.sh: line 27: 16524 Aborted                 $GEN ./$FILE
Makefile:62: recipe for target 'gen_lv2' failed
make[1]: *** [gen_lv2] Error 134
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/pi/zynthian-sw/plugins/DISTRHO-Ports'
Makefile:104: recipe for target 'lv2' failed
make: *** [lv2] Error 2


lv2_ttl_generator source is here:
https://github.com/DISTRHO/DISTRHO-Ports/tree/master/libs/lv2-ttl-generator

The command that is ruining is
lv2_ttl_generator ./TAL-Filter-2.so 

And ./TAL-Filter-2.so source is here:
https://github.com/DISTRHO/DISTRHO-Ports/tree/master/ports/tal-filter-2/source



Is there a way to debug what is going on?
This runs fine on a Raspberrypi which is armv7

A workaround would also help.

Using qemu-arm-static version from master from two days ago:
qemu-arm version 2.12.50 (v2.12.0-1182-ga7a7309ca5-dirty), commit: a7a7309ca52c327c6603d60db90ae4feeae719f7

Also saw this in qemu-arm version 2.12.0 (Debian 1:2.12+dfsg-3)

Thanks,
Guy
