[Qemu-devel] [Bug in qemu-system-ppc running Mac OS 9 on Windows 10]

Hi all,

I've been experiencing issues when installing Mac OS 9.x using
qemu-system-ppc.exe in Windows 10. After booting from CD image,
partitioning a fresh disk image often hangs Qemu. When using a
pre-partitioned disk image, the OS installation process halts
somewhere during the process. The issues can be resolved by setting
qemu-system-ppc.exe to run in Windows 7 compatibility mode.
AFAIK all Qemu builds for Windows since Mac OS 9 became available as
guest are affected.
The issue is reproducible by installing Qemu for Windows from Stephan
Weil on Windows 10 and boot/install Mac OS 9.x

Best regards and thanks for looking into this,
Howard

I assume there was some kind of behavior change for some of the
Windows API between Windows 7 and Windows 10, that is my guess as to
why the compatibility mode works. Could you run 'make check' on your
system, once in Windows 7 and once in Windows 10. Maybe the tests
will tell us something. I'm hoping that one of the tests succeeds in
Windows 7 and fails in Windows 10. That would help us pinpoint what
the problem is.
What I mean by run in Windows 7 is set the mingw environment to run
in Windows 7 compatibility mode (if possible). If you have Windows 7
on another partition you could boot from, that would be better.
Good luck.
p.s. use 'make check -k' to allow all the tests to run (even if one
or more of the tests fails).

Hi,

Thank you for you suggestion, but I have no means to run the check you
suggest. I cross-compile from Linux.

Best regards,
Howard
