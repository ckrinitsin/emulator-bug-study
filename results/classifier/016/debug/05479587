[Qemu-devel]  [BUG] network qga : windows os lost ip address of the network card  in some cases

We think this problem coulde be solevd in qga modulesãcan anybody give some 
advice ?


[BUG] network : windows os lost ip address of the network card  in some cases

we  found this problem for a long time ãFor example, if we has three network 
card in virtual xml file ï¼such as "network connection 1" / "network connection 
2"/"network connection 3" ã

Echo network card has own ip address ï¼such as 192.168.1.1 / 2.1 /3.1 , when 
delete the first card ï¼reboot the windows virtual os, then this problem 
happened !




we found that the sencond network card will  replace the first one , then the 
ip address of "network connection 2 " become 192.168.1.1 ã


Our third party users began to complain about this bug ãAll the business of the 
second ip  lost !!! 

I mean both of windows and linux has this bug ,  we solve this bug in linux  
throught bonding netcrad pci and mac address ã

There is no good solution on windows os . thera are ?  we implemented a plan to 
resumption of IP by QGA.  Is there a better way ?
