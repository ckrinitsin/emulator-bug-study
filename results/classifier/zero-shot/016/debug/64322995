[Qemu-devel] [BUG] trace: QEMU hangs on initialization with the	"simple" backend

While starting the softmmu version of QEMU, the simple backend waits for the
writeout thread to signal a condition variable when initializing the output file
path. But since the writeout thread has not been created, it just waits forever.

Thanks,
  Lluis
