[Qemu-devel] [BUG] [low severity] a strange appearance of message involving slirp while doing "empty" make

Folks,

If qemu tree is already fully built, and "make" is attempted, for 3.1, the 
outcome is:

$ make
        CHK version_gen.h
$

For 4.0-rc0, the outcome seems to be different:

$ make
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/build/malta-mips64r6/qemu-4.0/slirp'
make[1]: Nothing to be done for 'all'.
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/build/malta-mips64r6/qemu-4.0/slirp'
        CHK version_gen.h
$

Not sure how significant is that, but I report it just in case.

Yours,
Aleksandar

It's likely because slirp is currently being reworked to become a
separate project, so the makefiles have been changed a little bit. I
guess the message will go away again once slirp has become a stand-alone
library.

Well, we'll still need to ship slirp for the foreseeable future...

I think the cause of this is that the rule in Makefile for
calling the slirp Makefile is not passing it $(SUBDIR_MAKEFLAGS)
like all the other recursive make invocations. If we do that
then we'll suppress the entering/leaving messages for
non-verbose builds. (Some tweaking will be needed as
it looks like the slirp makefile has picked an incompatible
meaning for $BUILD_DIR, which the SUBDIR_MAKEFLAGS will
also be passing to it.)
