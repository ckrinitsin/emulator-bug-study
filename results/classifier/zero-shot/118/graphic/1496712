no bootable device after qemu-img convert parallels windows 2012 r2 to raw/qcow2 

Hello
We have converted a parallels windows 2012 R2 image with the command
qemu-img convert -p -f parallels -O raw ./TestLibvirt.pvm/TestLibvirtMig-0.hdd/TestLibvirtMig-0.hdd.0.hds /var/lib/libvirt/images/testlibvirtmig.raw

Afterthat we have created a new entry with virtual machine manager and used this raw-hdd file as "import existing disk image"

Then we booted this virtual server and we got the error 
"Booting from Hard Disk"
"no Bootable device"

Test 1: we also tried to "overwrite" the windows server drive
1. Create a vm with windows 2012 r2 (W2K12R2) with virtual machine manager. Which runs good
2. Then we mounted in the command line the "no bootable device" server  as source (raw image)
    mount /ev/mapper/loop0p4 /mnt/source
3. Then we mounted the new created (W2K12R2) as target (raw image)
    mount /ev/mapper/loop1p2 /mnt/target
4. with the copy command we have overwritten all files on the windows drive
    rsync -av --delete /mnt/source/* /mnt/target/ 
5. reboot the server and we have a blue screen and it tells me something prl_strg.sys 
     "your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart ...... If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED(prl_strg.sys)

Test 2: We also did a qemu-img convert from an ubuntu 14.04 disk and this works perfect.

Thanks a lot
Moritz

PS: Installation of Host-Server uses: ubuntu vivid 15.04 with

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest *upstream* version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays? (or in case you want to get support for qemu-img from Ubuntu instead, please use the "qemu" Ubuntu package as target, not the "qemu" project target)


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
