Documentation: Broken links to removed features in old changelog pages
Description of problem:
In QEMU changelogs prior to 6.1 (notably 6.0 at least) the removed features link goes to https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/system/removed-features.html instead of https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/about/removed-features.html. The deprecated features links are also broken.

This caused me some amount of confusion while trying to find the cause of several emulation issues.
Additional information:
Would have fixed myself but I cannot create a QEMU wiki account to do so. If there is a process for approval for that I will happily follow it and fix the issue when approved. I also can't see anywhere else to report this so apologies if this is the wrong place.

Perhaps the main changelog page could include links to the removed and deprecated features pages too?
