ACPI (Stop code 0x000000A5) BSOD During Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Setup
Description of problem:
When attempting to launch Windows XP Professional x64 Edition setup, the setup crashes with BSOD stop code 0x000000A5 and the following message:
```
A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.

If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:

The BIOS in this system is not fully ACPI compliant. Please contact your system vendor for an updated BIOS. If you are unable to obtain an updated BIOS or the latest BIOS supplied by your vendor is not ACPI compliant, you can turn off ACPI mode during textmode setup. To do this, press the F7 key when you are prompted to install storage drivers. The system will not notify you that the F7 key was pressed - it will silently disable ACPI and allow you to continue your installation.

Technical information:

*** STOP: 0x000000A5 (0x0000000000000014, 0xFFFFFA80000CBFC6, 0x000000000000008A, 0xFFFFFADFC8E31A90)
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. Obtain a copy of Windows XP Professional x64 Edition SP2.
2. Run QEMU using the provided command line (with the name & location of your ISO in place of "Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.iso")
Additional information:
It appears the bug may be dependent on KVM, I've seen some conflicting results, but with the provided command line removing "accel=kvm" or replacing it with "accel=tcg" changes the BSOD to one about lack of disk space.
Also, a similar bug occurs with Windows 2000 SP4, but the setup will hang instead of crash. (The hang can be avoided by pressing F5 and selecting "Standard PC" instead of either ACPI option during setup.)
