Cannot boot any UEFI systems after upgrade edk2-ovmf
Description of problem:
After upgrading edk2-ovmf from version 202208-1 to version 202208-3 none of my virtual machines on UEFI (windows and Arch linuw guest) have successfully started.

I'm using Virtual Manager and virt-viewer with virsh.

2. Restart all running VM
3. Vm with UEFI bios cannot boot
