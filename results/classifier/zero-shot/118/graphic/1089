when I use memory balloon,the qemu process memory usage is displayed incorrectly
Description of problem:
My vm memory is 4GB,and use the balloon driver,the balloon value is also 4GB.
I run a soft to consume memory in vm,I can see the memory usage rate is 15% in host. When I stop the soft in vm,the memory of free info in host and vm 
become normal,but use "top -d 3 -Hp $qemu_pid" to query in host,the memory usage rate is also 15%.I need to modify the balloon value in a smaller values,the memory usage rate will reduce. why?

Steps to reproduce:
1.run a soft to consume memory in vm,and query top info,the qemu process memory usage:15%


2.query free info in host and vm (reduce)


3.stop sort in vm


4.query free info in host and vm (recover)


5.query top info again (also 15%)



6.modify the balloon value in a smaller (modify the balloon value in a smaller values,the memory usage rate will reduce)
