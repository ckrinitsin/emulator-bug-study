Rapid tremendous memory hog when using -net nic,vlan=0 -net user,vlan=0

A rapid tremendous memory hog is occuring when I use -net nic,vlan=0 -net user,vlan=0. Tested with QEMU 2.8.0 & 2.9.0 in Gentoo. All available memory (8GB) + swap (over 20GB) is exhausted very rapidly. 

This bug is possibly related to 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1310714 
and maybe to
https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1288620

The bug IS present wheh I use -net nic,vlan=0 -net user,vlan=0 (tested with no model and model=e1000 and model=virtio, with all these the bug is present)

The bug is NOT present with I use this:
-netdev type=user,id=mynet0 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=mynet0

I tested this bug only using windows guests (Windows XP & Windows 8).

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
