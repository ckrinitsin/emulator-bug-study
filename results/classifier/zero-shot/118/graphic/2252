Poor VGA graphics when passing through a graphics card to a BIOS guest using the x-vga flag
Description of problem:
When passing through a GPU (in my case an Nvidia RTX 2070 Super) to a guest with BIOS firmware (using the x-vga flag to get a display out in BIOS mode), the VGA graphics used before an operating system loads proper graphics drivers seems to perform very poorly. Some symptoms of this are: GRUB and Windows Boot Manager are invisible, only showing a black screen (not sure if it affects all bootloaders) Windows 7 falls back to the more basic Vista boot animation during startup instead of the proper Starting Windows + orbs animation Windows 7 while using VGA graphics looks very low quality, with a pixelated look and a low color depth (attached below in additional information) Windows 10's setup just shows a black screen and fails to even boot. It seems to just restart after a bit (with any potential errors being invisible) Once graphics drivers are loaded inside Windows 7 or Linux in the guest, everything works fine. Seems like it's a firmware bug maybe?

I've tested, and QEMU version 8.1 seems to be the last version without this bug, as 8.2 and up all have this issue. I'm not sure if this affects all graphics cards, as I've only tested this on an RTX 2070 super.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a guest with SeaBIOS firmware
2. Pass through a graphics card using -vfio-pci
3. Enable the x-vga flag
