-cpu host or -cpu max breaks GRUB on AMD
Description of problem:
I'm running the on an AMD Ryzen CPU host.  I am emulating a Debian Bookworm image stored in a raw disk.  It uses GRUB to load a large (400MB) initrd.  When ran with the flag -cpu host or -cpu max, GRUB throws an out of memory error while loading the initrd.  This doesn't occur when using -cpu kvm64 or excluding the -cpu flag.

If I direct boot the initrd and kernel via -initrd and -kernel, it works fine.  The image also works with -cpu host on an Intel CPU host machine.  The image also works with -cpu EPYC.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a raw disk with a large initrd and GRUB boot loader
2. Start a qemu machine on an AMD host 
3. Receive an error: out of memory
Additional information:
I could try selectively enabling CPU features, but I was wondering if the maintainers knew of any feature that might be causing this or how to list the features -cpu host enables.

I also am not 100% that this is a QEMU bug, but it seems the only way to fix it is changing the QEMU config.
