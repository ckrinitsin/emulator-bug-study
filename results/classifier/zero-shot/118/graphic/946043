Serial Named Pipe Unrecognized Windows 7

I created a named pipe serial hardware and supplied '/tmp/debug' which I created using mkfifo

This is the snippet from ps -aux
-chardev pipe,id=charserial0,path=/tmp/debug -device isa-serial,chardev=charserial0,id=serial0

failure@ubuntu1:~$ ls -al /tmp/debug*
prwxrwxrwx 1 jgp jgp 0 2012-03-03 18:40 /tmp/debug
prwxrwxrwx 1 jgp jgp 0 2012-03-03 18:40 /tmp/debug.in

However inside the Windows 7 guest (even after a restart) nothing is recognized. Even after going through the add legacy hardware motions it's still not picked up.

Which version of QEMU were you using? Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
