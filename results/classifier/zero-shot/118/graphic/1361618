sparc cg3 1152x900 display abnormal

when I use -vga cg3 -g 1152x900 with qemu-system-sparc, the display is abnormal
I had try qemu-2.1.0 on win2003 with openBIOS or OBP
    qemu-system-sparc.exe -vga cg3 -g 1152x900
or
    qemu-system-sparc.exe -vga cg3 -g 1152x900 -bios ss5.bin

I also try qemu-2.0.2 on debian 6.0.1a i686 on VirtualBox host win2003
with same command, in vnc view, the display is same as on win2003.

If I don't use -g 1152x900 parameter, everything is OK, sunOS 4.1.4 work well.



Due to the OpenBIOS ROM being larger than OBP, it is currently unable to allocate enough memory for the larger 1152x900 framebuffer (and sadly it's not a simple fix to shrink down the memory requirements).

Fortunately if you are using the real Sun ROM ss5.bin then you can just use a real Sun cgthree ROM in order to get a 1152x900 framebuffer in QEMU. Currently you can find a copy at http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredette/tme/sun-u1-nbsd.html if you don't have one handy. 

Simply rename the existing OpenBIOS QEMU,cgthree.bin ROM to QEMU,cgthree.bin.old, download the real Sun cgthree ROM and rename it to QEMU,cgthree.bin in place of the old file. Now you should find you can start QEMU with -g 1152x900 and the larger display size will work fine.

I would say that this isn't necessarily a bug as it's more a restriction in the way OpenBIOS works, however I agree that the documentation is probably not particularly clear in this respect. One final note: the Sun cgthree ROM is fixed at 1152x900 resolution, so if you need to switch back to 1024x768 (or want to auto boot without manual intervention) then you'll need to temporarily rename the ROM files so the original OpenBIOS QEMU,cgthree.bin file is used once again.


Kind regards,

Mark.


new QEMU,cgthree.bin work fine, thank you!

Setting this to "invalid" since it's apparently rather a firmware than a QEMU issue.
