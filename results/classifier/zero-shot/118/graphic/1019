Cannot create a shared directory between Ubuntu 20.04 host and (sparc) NetBSD 8.2 guest
Description of problem:
I am currently trying to set up a shared directory between the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS host and the QEMU guest. However, the error messages that I receive from QEMU immediately are the following, but unfortunately I don't know the proper way to do this given the host and guest OS.
```
qemu-system-sparc: warning: hub port hub0port1 has no peer
qemu-system-sparc: warning: hub 0 with no nics
qemu-system-sparc: warning: netdev hub0port1 has no peer
qemu-system-sparc: warning: requested NIC (#net276, model virtio) was not created (not supported by this machine?)
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. Installed `samba` on the host with `sudo apt install samba`
2. Created `/home/rflint/shared_dir` on the host
3. Ran the command indicated at the top of the page.
