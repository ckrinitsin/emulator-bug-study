Spanish keys { and [ did not work

The keys { and [ did not work inside the virtualized enviorment (widnows 7).  The problems happens ussing aqemu as a front end as well as invoking qemu-kvm from command line:

qemu-kvm -m 8096 eclipse.img -smp cores=4,threads=2 -hdb ander.img -k es

We have also notices this warning in the console:

Warning: no scancode found for keysym 314

The host system is gentoo stable with some exceptions (mainly qemu-kvm-0.15.1-r1, gcc-4.6.2 and kernel-3.2_rc2)

Triaging old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU (currently version 2.8)?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
