command lspci does not show the IVSHMEM device

qeum version:
QEMU emulator version 4.2.1

I met a problem when I tried to use IVSHMEM. Command lspci does not show the IVSHMEM device.
Below is the configuration from my side:

1.  guest vm xml configuration.
  <shmem name='ivshmem'>
      <model type='ivshmem-plain'/>
      <size unit='M'>2</size>
      <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x10' function='0x0'/>
    </shmem>

2. after the booting up and I found the qemu commandline ideedly  have the device option:
ps aux | grep ivshmem
 /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 
      .......(ignore other options)
-object memory-backend-file,id=shmmem-shmem0,mem-path=/dev/shm/hostmem,size=4194304,share=yes -device ivshmem-plain,id=shmem0,memdev=shmmem-shmem0,bus=pcie.0,addr=0x10

3. lspci command  not shown the device.

4. lshw command indeedly show the device:

*-memory UNCLAIMED
             description: RAM memory
             product: Inter-VM shared memory
             vendor: Red Hat, Inc.

             configuration: latency=0

My host and vm os is ubuntu 20.04 and version is:

Hi ChangLimin,

Thanks for your reply. I checked again to find the device... I thought the
name was ivshmem.
I don't find any driver code for IVSHMEM in the linux and qemu repo. Can
you give me some help?

00:10.0 RAM memory: Red Hat, Inc. Inter-VM shared memory (rev 01)
Subsystem: Red Hat, Inc. QEMU Virtual Machine
Flags: fast devsel
Memory at fcc1c000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256]
Memory at fdc00000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=4M]

Thanks,
Sean

Sounds like this question has been solved, thus I'm closing this ticket now.
