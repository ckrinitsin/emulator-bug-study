QEMU immediately exits when combining a GL-enabled SDL display with SPICE
Description of problem:
Running QEMU with the given command line results in QEMU immediately exiting with this line being printed, and no other output:

```
qemu-system-x86_64: Display spice is incompatible with the GL context
```

I am unsure whether this is a supported mode of setting up QEMU, but QEMU 6.2.0 ran just fine with it (or, to be more precise, it wasn't an issue until ac32b2fff127843355b4f7e7ac9f93dd4a395adf).

The issue does not happen with `-display sdl,gl=off`, as GL is presumably not involved at all in that case.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run `./qemu-system-x86_64 -display sdl,gl=on -spice port=5930`.
Additional information:
This issue has been reproduced on other distributions, including Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04.
