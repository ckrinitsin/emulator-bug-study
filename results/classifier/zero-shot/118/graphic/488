[git]Virt-Manager cannot start any previously created virtual machine with Qemu commit bd306cfe: 'spicevmc' is not a valid char driver name
Description of problem:
With qemu built on commit bd306cfe, I'm unable to start a previously created VM. 

Because of both bug #463 and #474 I was blocked from building qemu from git for something like a week or so. My last built and working Qemu is based on commit 9bef7ea9d9.

Doing a git bissect won't be an easy task :(
Steps to reproduce:
1. Build qemu using commit bd306cfe
2. Launch Virt-Manager
3. Try to launch a previously created VM or try to boot a new one.
Additional information:
Every single time I tried to launch a VM, I get a dialog box with this error message:

```
