macOS cocoa UI cursor position mismatch when running Windows XP under QEMU 9.1.0
Description of problem:
QEMU 9.1.0 got hardware cursor support on macOS with the cocoa UI. When running a Windows XP guest, the windows's own cursor got a 13 pixel offset both in X and Y direction. When the "show-cursor" is off, the problem still exists, so the click target is not under the pointer of the cursor. I was using the "Red Hat QXL GPU" driver v6.1.0.10024 which was built in 2015.

I also checked it with Linux (i have an x86-64 Alma Linux 8 installation too), this working fine when using the "-display cocoa,show-cursoor=off,zoom-to-fit=off -device virtio-vga" parameters.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Load a Windows XP with QXL drivers installed
