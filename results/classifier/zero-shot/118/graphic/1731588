qemu-system-arm black screen and keyboard not detected

Hi guys, 

I try to emulate FreeRTOS with this guide : http://wiki.csie.ncku.edu.tw/embedded/Lab32
But, the keys on my keyboard are not taken into account. 
 - Command line : qemu_stm32/arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm -M stm32-p103 -monitor stdio -kernel build/main.bin -semihosting
If I try to add usb flag with : qemu_stm32/arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm -M stm32-p103 -monitor stdio -kernel build/main.bin -usb -device usb-host,hostbus=1,hostaddr=1 -show-curso
I obtain this message "qemu-system-arm: -device usb-host,hostbus=1,hostaddr=1: 'usb-host' is not a valid device model name"

My second option is try with the latest version of qemu with this command line : "qemu-system-arm -M lm3s6965evb -monitor stdio -kernel build/main.bin -semihosting" but I obtain a black screen. 

Could someone guide me on this problem ?

"stm32-p103" is not a board model supported by upstream QEMU. Presumably you're using a fork of QEMU -- you should ask whoever is responsible for that fork about it.


For the second command line -- is the binary you're trying to run built for the stellaris board model you're trying to run it on? If it's the same binary you tried to use with the stm32 board model then I wouldn't expect it to work. You need to build a binary that targets the board model you run with.
