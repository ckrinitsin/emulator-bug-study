crashout on any storage operation on SCO OpenServer 6
Description of problem:
it's hard to exactly pinpoint what's wrong, but apparently it's a known issue. whenever i attempt to install or boot the OS, i get one of the two outcomes: with KVM it's a halt-and-catch-fire, getting stuck in an eternal loop of I/O errors and failed interrupts, with TCG at the very least the drivers get loaded and the installation disk is mounted, contrary to the emulated hard drive. connecting either drive to SCSI made HBA act like it's not there at all, and using the standard AHCI/IDE controllers leads to the result presented in the picture in one of the sections below, and, as mentioned earlier, this stage only happens with TCG. there's a 9:1 shot (on Q35, on PIIX3/PIIX4 it'll always either throw this exception or fail to initialise the CD-ROM) of it either screaming about a power failure right as it's ready to format the drive or it just installing.
Steps to reproduce:
1. download the old OpenServer 6 VM image/ISO from the SCO/Xinuos server.
2. attach it in your config.
3. go through initial setup stages (eg. entering a licence or deferring from such).
4. wait for the disk initialisation to begin.
