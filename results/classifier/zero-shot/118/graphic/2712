Windows VM doesn't boot on QEMU KVM when hypervisor is disabled in Linux 6.12
Description of problem:
Windows VM doesn't boot on QEMU KVM when hypervisor is disabled in Linux 6.12. QEMU uses 100% CPU core usage and nothing happens.

It boots properly in Linux 6.11.10. I don't know if it's a kernel bug or QEMU needs some changes to work with the new kernel correctly.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Boot Windows 10 or 11 (can be installation ISO form official website) with KVM, but set "hypervisor=off" CPU parameter.
2. Wait.
3. Nothing happens - doesn't boot.
Additional information:
Nothing is displayed in console.
