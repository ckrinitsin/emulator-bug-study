qemu-x86_64 uses host libraries instead of emulated system libraries
Description of problem:
I'm using Buildroot to build a cross-compiled embedded Linux system. During the build process there is a little hack to create some header file using a cross-compiled application. For this hack they use qemu to run this application. Building this embedded system for aarch64 work fine, but for x86_64 I get the following messages:

bytecode_builtins_list_generator: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.29' not found (required by bytecode_builtins_list_generator)
bytecode_builtins_list_generator: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.33' not found (required by bytecode_builtins_list_generator)
bytecode_builtins_list_generator: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by bytecode_builtins_list_generator)
bytecode_builtins_list_generator: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by bytecode_builtins_list_generator)

The path of the libraries in this error message is from my host system. The embedded system uses /lib64 or /usr/lib64. It seems to me that the linker search for the libraries at first on the host system and later uses the path from the command line. So you have a mixed up of host and embedded system libraries (as you can see in the attached strace log).
