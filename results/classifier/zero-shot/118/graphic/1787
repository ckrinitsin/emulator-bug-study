![1](/uploads/a44f3790fe6c375aa8eac3a178da963d/1.jpg)
Steps to reproduce:
1.Start the vm with qxl and spice.
2.Attach the vm with vnc and spice.
3.Placed for more than three days.
4.Operation on spice client and possible reproduce this bug.
Additional information:
https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/44f28df24767cf9dca1ddc9b23157737c4cbb645/ui/cursor.c#L112
I think the reason for the problem is that the cursor pointer was not set to NULL when qemu call cursor_put. But I don't know what situation will trigger this error.
This error is difficult to reproduce by natural.
