[Regression v8.2/v9.0+] stuck at SeaBIOS for >30s with 100% CPU (1T)
Description of problem:
starting our Linux direct-kernel-boot VMs with same args on different hosts/hardware will get stuck at SeaBIOS for 30-60s with 100% 1T CPU load starting with v8.2 and also in v9.0. v9.0.0 and v8.2.3 - v8.1.5 is OK. To be clear, everything seems to be fine after that, though I did not do any benchmarks to compare performance. It just delays (re)booting by almost 1 minute, which is a shame, because before that update/regression it was instant and our VMs only take 4s to boot, which is now more like 60s.
Downgrading to v8.1 instantly fixes it, upgrading to v8.2/v9.0 instantly breaks it.
Steps to reproduce:
1. start VM with same args on different versions

somehow if I save this bug with `/label ~"kind::Bug"` it disappears, so I'm unable to add/keep the label
