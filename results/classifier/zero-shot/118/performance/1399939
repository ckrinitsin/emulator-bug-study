Qemu build with -faltivec and maltivec support  in 

if is possible add the build support for qemu for have the  -faltivec -maltivec in CPPFLAGS  for make the emulation more faster on PPC equiped machine . 
Thank you

We assume that your C compiler generates decently optimised code that uses the features of your host CPU with just the standard -O2 optimisation flag. If this isn't the case, you can use configure's --extra-cflags argument (eg "--extra-cflags=-faltivec -maltivec") to get the build process to pass arbitrary flags to the compiler. Is that not sufficient here?


Will check it , i had been made my personal build modding the Makefile with altivec commands in CPPFLAGS.
i dont know if it was a placebo effect but look like everything is more faster.



Closing this ticket since adding CPPFLAGS to configure is possible.
