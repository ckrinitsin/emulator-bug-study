Mac M1 Max / Debian guest / Luks password / Switching to graphical login manager (lightdm/Gdm) hangs in 75%
Description of problem:
In approximately 70% of cases I start QEMU with a Debian guest where the Debian guest was installed with full disk encryption, QEMU 'hangs' (does not respond') after I unlock the encrypted guest and the guest tries to start the graphical login manager (gdm or lightdm).

I need to force quit QEMU, restart it multiple times until the start of the graphical login manager works.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install Debian with (guided) full disk encryption and either the Gnome or the XFCE desktop environment
2. To be able to unlock the hard disk after the installation finished, the Linux boot parameter 'console=tty1' needs to be added within grub to the Linux command line
3. Try to restart/reboot QEMU  several times and QEMU will become unresponsive multiple times in this process.
Additional information:
I encounter this problem for several months now, with different versions of QEMU, macOS and Debian.

There is one observation, which might help: I installed [DropBear](https://packages.debian.org/buster/dropbear-initramfs) to experiment with remote unlocking of Luks encrypted Linux boxes. It seems, that QEMU does not go into the unresponsive state, when I unlock the hard disk via SSH and not focus the QEMU window until after the graphical login manager started. (Only tried remote unlocking a few times so it is too early to confirm if this works 100% of the time.
