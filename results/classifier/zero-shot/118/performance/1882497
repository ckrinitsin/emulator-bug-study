Missing 'cmp' utility makes build take 10 times as long

I have been doing some work cross compiling qemu for Windows using a minimal Fedora container. Recently I started hitting some timeouts on the CI service and noticed a build of all targets was going over 1 hour.

It seems like the 'cmp' utility from diffutils is used somewhere in the process and if it's missing, either a configure or a make gets run way too many times - I'll try to pull logs from the CI system at some stage soon.

Could a warning or error be added if cmp is missing?

cmp is used in the makefiles. 

And there is some kind of warning during build if it is missing:

/bin/sh: cmp: command not found

But perhaps it should abort the build in this case.

Something like that helps:

diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile
index 40e4f7677bde..05e029bd99db 100644

                printf '#define QEMU_FULL_VERSION "$(FULL_VERSION)"\n'; \


Does this problem still persist with the latest version of QEMU (since we switched the build system mostly to meson now)?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
