Windows 2008R2 very slow cold boot when 4 CPUs

Hi,

well, I'm in a similar boat as the one in #992067. But regardless any memory-settings.
It takes "ages" in a cold-boot Windows 2008R2 with qemu-1.0.1, qemu-1.0.50 and latest-n-greatest from today ( 1.0.50 /qemu-1b3e76e ). It eats up 400% host-cpu-load until login-prompt is shown on the console.

Meanwhile I tried couple of settings with "-cpu features (hv_spinlocks), hv_relaxed and hv_vapic. ".
Due to some Clock-glitches I start qemu-system-x86_64 with "-no-hpet".

With 2 processors the system is up after 2 minutes, with 4 procs almost 10 minutes... After a reset ( warmstart) the 4 proc-system is up after a couple of 20 secs.

Hints welcome, though once started, the system seems to operate "normally".

Thnx in@vance,

Oliver.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
