Windows 10 extremely slow and unresponsive

Hi,

Fedora 32, x64
qemu-5.0.0-2.fc32.x86_64

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO
Win10_2004_English_x64.iso

Windows 10 is excruciatingly slow since upgrading to 5.0.0-2.fc32.  Disabling your repo and downgrading to 2:4.2.0-7.fc32 and corrects the issue (the package in the Fedora repo).

You can duplicate this off of the Windows 10 ISO (see above) and do not even have to install Windows 10 itself.

Please fix,

Many thanks,
-T
