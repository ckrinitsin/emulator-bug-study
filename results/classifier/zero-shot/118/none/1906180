Keyboard keys get stuck

Keyboard keys get "stuck" quite often, on certain Linux guests at least, and start repeating themselves until another key is pressed. This is especially noticeable with key combinations like Ctrl+V for pasting. When it happens, you get the pasted text and vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv...

This bug has been present for quite some time but I don't remember any specific version that had it first.


QEMU version: 5.1.0
Guest: Debian stable 64-bit (live), with Gnome desktop (may occur with other Linux guests too)
Host: Arch Linux with KDE desktop (X11, wayland not tested); both default and hardened kernel tested

QEMU start command:
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 6G -cpu host -smp 3 -cdrom debian.iso -boot d -vga std

Which user interface do you use? SDL? GTK? VNC?

I've encountered this with GTK interface. I'll test if this occurs with SDL too.

Can you confirm whether you are executing QEMU on your local desktop/laptop machine, or remotely over SSH with X11-forwarding, or over a remote VNC server, etc ? In the remote cases stuck keys is somewhat of a known problem especially if latency is bad

I'm running it on local desktop.

I've been testing this with SDL interface but haven't yet encountered this bug. So this might be specific to the GTK interface.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

This might be less common in 5.2.0 but I have still had some strange issues with keyboard.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
