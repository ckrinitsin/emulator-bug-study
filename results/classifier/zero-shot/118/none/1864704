No compatible -machine option in qemu-system-ppc64 for e6500 core

Hi,

I'm trying to use qemu-system-ppc64 for emulating a QorIQ T2080 (with e6500 cores). 
However, I couldn't find any -machine option that matches -cpu e6500 option, which are listed below:

I am wondering if anyone knows that is if any of them can be selected for such emulation? Thank you!

Try "-M ppce500 -cpu e6500"

Thank you very much for your reply, Laurent. Does it mean that we can just use "-M ppce500 -cpu e6500" and for other options, there is no need to change? Is there any approach to verify this setup (for example, with a bare metal elf running in T2080)? Thanks again!

You could try to build an image for this machine with buildroot (see https://buildroot.org/). Anyway, I'm closing this ticket now since this was not a bug.
