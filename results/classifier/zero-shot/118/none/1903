qemu/kvm are instantly SIGKILLed by systemd on shutdown, without wait.
Description of problem:
systemd assumes it cannot terminate qemu, and SIGKILLs it. Instantly.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start qemu on a systemd managed host
2. Shutdown/Reboot
Additional information:
Nothing on qemu's own log, besides that it is starting a vnc server.

I cannot explain why it sends SIGKILL to qemu/kvm... it is the same second as the shutdown started, their docs says there's a delay for that.

Also, other processes owned by the user received a single SIGTERM after qemu was SIGKILLed. Some even take a couple seconds to exit and are not SIGKILLed.
