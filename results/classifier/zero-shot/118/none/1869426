5.0rc0->4.2 serial migraiton

Migrating from 5.0rc0->4.2 with pc-q35-4.2 we get an error:

Unknown savevm section or instance 'serial' 1

dumping the migration streams it looks like 5.0 is duplicating the serial migration data:

    "serial (26)": {
        "divider": "0x000c",

    },

    serial: realize the serial device

    Instead of calling serial_realize_core(), use the QDev realize
    callback.

Marc-Andre: I think you're ending up with two top level objects with vmsd's

I thought backward migration wasn't supported.

Isn't it this commit?

    serial: register vmsd with DeviceClass
    
    Migration from old to new code works, however the other way fails for
    devices that use serial_init/serial_mm_init with "base", used as
    instance_id previously.
    
    (with qdev_set_legacy_instance_id, the alias_id is only used in
    savevm.c:find_se(), and thus can only be used to match against
    "legacy" instance id values. On new code, instance_id is generated
    incrementally from 0 with calculate_new_instance_id(), based on
    "qdev-path/vmsd-name")
