Intel GVT-g works in X11, segfaults in wayland

Hello,

I am using an uptodate Arch Linux 64bit with qemu version 4.2.0, but the problem was also present in older versions. The problem occurs with Linux 5.4 and 4.19.
The problem also occurs with Debian as guest. I am running sway.
If I provide -vga std, then qemu works fine until I use the qemu window to switch to the vfio-pci device. There are no problems under X11/xwayland at all.


Commandline:
qemu-system-x86_64
    -enable-kvm
    -cpu host
    -smp 2
    -m 8192
    -display gtk,gl=on
    -device vfio-pci,sysfsdev=/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/[ID]/,x-igd-opregion=on,display=on
    -cdrom archlinux-2019.11.01-x86_64.iso
    -vga none

Forgot to mention, the crash is a segfault.
If there is more information needed, I am happy to provide it.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


Still present on qemu 5.2.0 and Linux 5.10


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
