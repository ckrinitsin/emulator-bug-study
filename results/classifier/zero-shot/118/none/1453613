the help message of the set_password subcommand of the qemu monitor isn't usable

`help set_password` in qemu monitor prints `set_password protocol password action-if-connected -- set spice/vnc password` which doesn't allow to figure out how to use this subcommand.

I think the 'help' text in the monitor is only really intended as a brief usage summary reminder (in particular "help" on its own prints the concatenation of all the "help foo" command help, so having "help foo" print a long bit of documentation makes "help" output look weird). The full documentation of each command is in the QEMU documentation proper, which is now at https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/monitor.html#commands and where the 'set_password' documentation describes the behaviour more fully.

To make this work in general we'd have to somehow support rendering the rST-format documentation that ends up in the manual as a user response in the monitor, which feels like it would be tricky.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
