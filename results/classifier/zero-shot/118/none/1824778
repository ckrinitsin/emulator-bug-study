PowerPC64: tlbivax does not work for addresses above 4G

The tlbivax instruction in QEMU does not work for address above 4G. The reason behind this is a simple 32bit trunction of an address.
Changing the argument ea from uint32_t to target_ulong for the function booke206_invalidate_ea_tlb() in target/ppc/mmu_helper.c solves the issue.

I did not reproduce this using Linux so I have no public example for reproducing it. However it's a pretty straight forward change.

Issue can be seen in all version of QEMU.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved
to QEMU's new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked
as 'expired' now. Please continue with the discussion here:
