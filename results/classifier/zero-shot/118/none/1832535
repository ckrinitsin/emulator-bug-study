[riscv/regression] Missing tlb flush introduced in refactoring

Hello,

In qemu-system-riscv64, following a QEMU update, I get all sort of weird and not easily reproducible crashes in my risc-v guest.

I have bissected this issue to commit c7b951718815694284501ed01fec7acb8654db7b.
Some TLB flushes were removed in the following places:
target/riscv/cpu_helper.c: `csr_write_helper(env, s, CSR_MSTATUS);` -> `env->mstatus = s;` (twice)
target/riscv/op_helper.c: `csr_write_helper(env, s, CSR_MSTATUS);` -> `env->mstatus = s;` (twice)

Adding TLB flushes in all 4 places fixes the issues for me.

Hello,

Thanks for reporting a bug.

Can you please include details to reproduce the problems that you are seeing? This includes images and command line arguments.

Do you also mind including the diff of what fixes the problem for you?
