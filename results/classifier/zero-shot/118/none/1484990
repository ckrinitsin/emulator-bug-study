fsfreeze-hook script should also ignored dpkg generated files

Hello,

In the fsfreeze-hook script, the following code check if some of the files should be ignored:


# Check whether file $1 is a backup or rpm-generated file and should be ignored
is_ignored_file() {
    case "$1" in
        *~ | *.bak | *.orig | *.rpmnew | *.rpmorig | *.rpmsave | *.sample)
            return 0 ;;
    esac
    return 1
}

The functions should probably also skip dpkg generated files.

I've found a list of the different extensions in the systemd source tree: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/src/basic/util.c#L1871

(late) Hi,
You are right Laurent, IMHO they should be added.
Not very critical since as of today there are no conffiles in there yet, but still right to do so.

Adding an Ubutu task to include the fix and actually also the script to better support the freeze/thaw operations.

The link you added has changed a lot, but due to the feats of git the following will do for what you initially suggested.

https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/61ee6939819963b7845c101485e188ca2a8119c6/src/basic/util.c#L1871

I submitted a change based on the suggestion upstream: 
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-12/msg02142.html

Grml, due to LP posts being mirrored on the ML this is kind of redundant when viewed from the ML.
But I want to leave that info for LP-only-readers as well :-/

  * Added Changes
    - update VCS-git to match the bionic branch
    - sdl2 is yet too unstable for the LTS Ubuntu release given the reports
      we still see upstream and in Debian - furthermore sdl2 isn't in main yet,
      so we revert related changes to stick with the proven for now:
      - 0fd25810 - do not build-depend on libx11-dev (libsdl2-dev already
                   depends on it)
      - 9594f820 - switch from sdl1.2 to sdl2 (#870025)
    - d/qemu-system-x86.README.Debian: document intention of nested being
      default is comfort, not full support
    - update Ubuntu machine types for qemu 2.11
    - qemu-guest-agent: freeze-hook fixes (LP: #1484990)
      - d/p/guest-agent-freeze-hook-skip-dpkg-artifacts.patch
      - d/qemu-guest-agent.install: provide /etc/qemu/fsfreeze-hook
      - d/qemu-guest-agent.dirs: provide /etc/qemu/fsfreeze-hook.d
    - Create and install pxe netboot images for KVM s390x (LP: #1732094)
      - d/rules enable install s390x-netboot.img
      - debian/patches/ubuntu/partial-SLOF-for-s390x-netboot-compilation.patch
    - d/control-in: enable RDMA support in qemu (LP: #1692476)
    - on s390x provide facility bits 81 (ppa15) and 82 (bpb) (LP: #1743560)
      - d/p/ubuntu/linux-headers-update-to-4.15-rc1.patch
      - d/p/ubuntu/linux-headers-update-4.15-rc9.patch
      - d/p/ubuntu/lp1743560-s390x-kvm-Handle-bpb-feature.patch
      - d/p/ubuntu/lp1743560-s390x-kvm-provide-stfle.81.patch
    - tolerate ipxe size change on migrations to >=18.04 (LP: #1713490)
      - d/p/ubuntu/pre-bionic-256k-ipxe-efi-roms.patch: old machine types
        reference 256k path
      - d/control: depend on ipxe-qemu-256k-compat-efi-roms to be able to
        handle incoming migrations from former releases.
    - d/control-in: enable seccomp on s390x
  * Dropped changes (no more needed):
    - Dropped VHOST_NET_ENABLED and KVM_HUGEPAGES from /etc/default/qemu-kvm
      The functionality is retained for upgraders, but is deprecated.
      Post 18.04 the implementation for these configurations will be removed.
  * Dropped changes (in Debian now):
    - ppc64[le] support
      - Enable seccomp for ppc64el
      - bump libseccomp-dev dependency, 2.3 is the minimum for ppc64
    - disable missing x32 architecture
    - d/rules: or32 is now named or1k (since 4a09d0bb)
    - d/qemu-system-common.docs: new paths since (ac06724a)

      qemu-qmp-ref,qemu-ga-ref
  * Dropped changes (integrated upstream):
    - d/p/detect-ITS-and-skip-usage-on-older-kernel.patch to avoid crashes
      on arm64 when doing suspend/resume and reboots due to older kernels not
      supporting ITS (LP 1731051).
    - Apply linux-user-return-EINVAL-from-prctl-PR_-_SECCOMP.patch from
      James Cowgill to prevent qemu-user from forwarding prctl seccomp
      calls (LP 1726394)
    - update to upstream 2.10.1 point release (LP 1722808)

Christian, what happened to the upstream patch? Looks like it never got included? Could you please poke the maintainer, so we could finally close this bug for upstream, too?

Yeah I even got help back then to make sure CCs are better but nothing happened.
Old thread: http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-12/msg02142.html

I re-pinged on the old thread to be reconsidered.
New Ping: http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-08/msg03892.html

Thanks Thomas for making me aware this was still lingering unresolved.


Fix had been included here (in QEMU v3.1 already):
