RFE: QMP: report error reason in BLOCK_IO_ERROR message

when a disk drive is configured with the error policy enospc for write errors, the monitoring client needs a way to distinguish
betwwen generic I/O error and the I/O error for space exausted.

The JSON QMP protocol lacks this information: the BLOCK_IO_ERROR message does not provide a reason or code for the error verified, so the monitoring client cannot distinguish the source of the errors.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
