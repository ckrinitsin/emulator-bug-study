Exclude keys from grab

Feature request: pressing every time a shortcut to release grab for switching windows/desktops is pretty annoying, especially for users of tiling WMs.

QEMU have to have a way to specify keys or shortcuts (possibly something like "everything with the specified modifier key"), which would not be intercepted.

Alternatively/additionally it would be nice to be able to disable keys grabbing at all.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
