Parallel build doesn't work after "make clean"

After running "make clean" qemu won't build with -j option.
When I run "./configure && make clean" and then make -j5, following errors occur:
  GEN   config-host.h
  GEN   trace.h
  GEN   qemu-options.def
  GEN   qmp-commands.h
  GEN   qapi-types.h
  GEN   qapi-visit.h
  GEN   tests/test-qapi-types.h
  GEN   tests/test-qapi-visit.h
  GEN   tests/test-qmp-commands.h
  GEN   qapi-generated/qga-qapi-types.h
  GEN   qapi-generated/qga-qapi-visit.h
  GEN   qapi-generated/qga-qmp-commands.h
  CC    osdep.o
  CC    qemu-thread-posix.o
cc1: error: qapi-generated: No such file or directory [-Werror]
cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

make: *** [qemu-thread-posix.o] Error 1
make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
cc1: error: qapi-generated: No such file or directory [-Werror]
cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

make: *** [osdep.o] Error 1

If you run "make -j5" once again after this, build continues succesfully because  "qapi-generated" directory already exists.

I think this should have been fixed at one point in time - at least it seems to work for me, so I'm closing this ticket now. If you still have problems, feel free to open this ticket again, but then please specify the exact version of QEMU which causes the trouble for you.
