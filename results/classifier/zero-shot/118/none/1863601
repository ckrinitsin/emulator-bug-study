unable to type "|" character in french keyboard.

Unable to type "|" character when using french keyboard. It is displaying "<" instead of pipe.

Can you provide more information here. What command line have you launched QEMU with ?  How are you interacting with QEMU (serial console, GTK UI, VNC, SPICE ?)  If VNC/SPICE, what client app are you using ?  

Hi Daniel, Thanks for your response. I am using virt-manager to start with to connect with VNC.

Can you provide the QEMU command line (/var/log/libvirt/qemu/$GUEST.log) 

Check you have selected the french keymap in virt-manager (see attached picture)

Actually you explicitly do *NOT* want to select any keymap in virt-manager in general. Picking a keymap disables the VNC protocol extension for raw scancodes. This means that QEMU has to do keymap <-> scancode conversion. In such a setup the host OS desktop keymap, the QEMU keymap and the guest OS keymap all have to match perfectly to avoid bad conversions.

By *not* selecting a keymap, virt-manager gets raw scancodes on the local host OS desktop and passes them unmodified to QEMU, which then passes them on to the guest OS. In this case, the guest OS keymap is the only thing that has todo conversions & this should be reliable.

The only reason to select a keymap for QEMU is if you need to use legacy VNC clients which don't support the raw scancode protocol extension. This shouldn't be required if using virt-manager only. Ideally virt-manager should not even show this config option by default.

Yes, it works without selecting a keyboard on my machine with a french keyboard.

But perhaps Aditya has explicitly selected another keyboard than "fr" or "Auto"?

Aditya, does the problem still persist? If so, could you please provide the QEMU command line as requested by Daniel?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
