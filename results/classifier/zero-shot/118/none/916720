select fails on windows because a non-socket fd is in the rfds set

The select call in file main_loop.c at line 460 fails on windows because a non-socket fd is in the rfds set. As a result, gdb remote connections will never be accepted by qemu. The select function returns with -1. WSAGetLastError returns code 10038 (WSAENOTSOCK).

I start qemu as follows:
qemu-system-arm -cpu cortex-m3 -M lm3s6965evb -nographic -monitor null -serial null -semihosting -kernel test1.elf -S -gdb tcp:127.0.0.1:2200

qemu is configure with:
CFLAGS="-O4 -march=i686"
configure --target-list="i386-softmmu arm-softmmu sparc-softmmu ppc-softmmu" --prefix=/home/qemu/install --cc=mingw32-gcc --host-cc=mingw32-gcc --audio-drv-list="dsound sdl" --audio-card-list="ac97 es1370 sb16 cs4231a adlib gus"

Do you know where the non-socket fd comes from?  I have some patches to improve the situation on Win32 for the main loop, I'll send them next week to the mailing list.


It is added to the list by glib_select_fill. Other than that I couldn't find out what the fd is for.

I forgot to add the symptoms of the problem, so i'll add them now so people can google them.

I'm also getting this error. Both on my own compile version 1.0 and on the version from http://lassauge.free.fr/qemu/
I have not been able to find a workaround for getting gdb to work. Does anybody knows a patch or a workaround?

it seems that g_main_context_default creates a semaphore which is added into rfds passed to glib_select_fill function, that's why select fails.

Patches posted to the list.

I am still seeing the symptoms that Arie pointed out:

I started QEMU like:

arm-none-eabi-qemu-system.exe -gdb tcp:127.0.0.1:1234,nowait,nodelay,server,ipv4 -S -semihosting -kernel hello.out

This was with an ARM EABI system emulator that I built from today's mainline.  From a brief look it seems like QEMU is going into 'g_poll' and never coming out.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
