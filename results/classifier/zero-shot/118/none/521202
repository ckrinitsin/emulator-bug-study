Windows XP x64 / 2008 Server x64 broken on 32-bit hosts with QEMU > 0.9.0

QEMU >0.9.0 fails to install/run 64-bit Windows XP guests on 32-bit hosts. This is mentioned here: http://qemu-forum.ipi.fi/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=4625 . As explained there, 0.9.0 manages to install and run XP64 fine, if somewhat slowly. The host is an actual 32-bit CPU (Athlon XP), although I've tested it and confirmed the bug to occur on a Core2 Duo CPU running in 32-bit mode with KVM disabled. It's impossible to test with KVM enabled, as this causes Windows to detect a 32-bit CPU and refuse to run.

When installing, the installer hangs at the "Setup is starting Windows" step. An attempt at running a converted VBox image reveals the problem lies somewhere in the ACPI -- in safe mode, the boot sequence gets to loading ACPI tables, then hangs indefinitely. Interestingly enough, the emulator itself runs fine, you can interact with the monitor etc., but the virtual CPU appears to stop; there's a marked point in "log cpu" output after which nothing comes. Disabling ACPI predictably does nothing to help, as in this case Windows refuses to run.

I've tested with several versions, and 0.9.1 is the first one to break. The bug is still present in 0.11 and 0.12 as packaged by Ubuntu.

Any progress on this one?

The installer flashes the keyboard LED and clears the screen at that point when run on physical hardware.

Can you still reproduce this bug with the latest version of QEMU?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
