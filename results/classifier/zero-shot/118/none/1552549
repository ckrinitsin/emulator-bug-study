qemu-system-i386 verison 2.5.50 fails at lmsw instruction

I cloned qemu source code from github.com, and compiled it on my Kubuntu 15.10 laptop to run my little OS. When booting my little OS, the virtual machine's screen keep blinking, I guess it's the virtual machine rebooting on and on automatically for some unknown reason, but there is no further information shown on Kubuntu's terminal. I'm pretty sure this problem is not caused by my little OS, because it works just fine in qemu-system-i386 version 2.5.0.

I debugged my OS and find this problem happens when executing instruction "lmsw ax". Is this a bug, can anyone help me out?

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays? If not, can you provide an example for testing?
