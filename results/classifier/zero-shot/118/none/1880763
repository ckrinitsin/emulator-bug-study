Missing page crossing check in use_goto_tb() for rx target

Currently the rx target doesn't have the page crossing check in its 
use_goto_tb() function. 
This is a required feature for stable system mode emulations that all 
other targets implement.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days (otherwise it will get
closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate the ticket auto-
matically to the new system.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

For the record, this was fixed for 6.1 in

    target/rx: Use translator_use_goto_tb
    
    Just use translator_use_goto_tb directly at the one call site,
    rather than maintaining a local wrapper.
