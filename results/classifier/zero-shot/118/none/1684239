vvfat core dump when enabling RW

Hi guys,

I'm getting this qemu crash message:
>>> qemu-system-x86_64: /build/qemu-TziMIO/qemu-2.5+dfsg/block/vvfat.c:2290: commit_direntries: Assertion `!strncmp(s->directory.pointer, "QEMU", 4)' failed.
>>> Aborted (core dumped)
when launching qemu with this options for a VVFAT drive:
>>> -drive file=fat:rw:./ROOT,if=virtio
(same happens when using cache=none and/or if=ide)

"uname -a" system info is:

and "qemu --version" is:
>>> QEMU emulator version 2.5.0 (Debian 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.10), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

Not sure what logs to attach but I'll be glad to upload whatever needed.

Thanks in advance for you help,
Rolando

Moving to QEMU-Ubuntu since you're not using upstream QEMU (and the bug should have been fixed there as pointed out by Herv√© on the qemu-devel mailing list).

The mentioned commit is:

commit ebb72c9f066e5f85259e1541a6d3fb5bfd6e73ff
Author: Kevin Wolf <email address hidden>
Date:   Wed Apr 27 14:11:38 2016 +0200

    vvfat: Fix volume name assertion

    Commit d5941dd made the volume name configurable, but it didn't consider
    that the rw code compares the volume name string to assert that the
    first directory entry is the volume name. This made vvfat crash in rw
    mode.

    This fixes the assertion to compare with the configured volume name
    instead of a literal string.

The fix is present since v2.6.0
As you're using v2.5.0, can you try with a newer QEMU version?

That means it is fixed in Yakkety and later, and not Broken in Trusty yet as the feature is not in.

Thank you Rolando for your report!
I think the issue is valid and a backport as SRU [1] possible.

I don't think you need to upload further Data, yet there is more you can help with.
For the SRU and testing it we will need some simplified steps to reproduce (and verify the fix).
Also see the Section SRU Template in [1].

So if you could add your steps to create the vfat image that then lets you trigger this that might help - I doubt it in this particular case, but sometimes suboptions on those steps are important so it is always better to get those from the bug reporter.

Also - if possible - it would be great if you could verify that those steps on Yakkety or later then succeed as expected since the upstream fix is already in there.

[1]: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates

Gah obviously for vvfat it isn't an image to be created at all.
So I thought steps to reproduce are:

1. get a guest that works (via uvtoools-libvirt or whatever you prever)
2. get the qemu commandline that it is started with, in my case:
   $ sudo kvm -m 1024 -drive file=/dev/sdb,format=raw,cache=none,index=0,media=disk
3. create a dir (can be empty) to share in vvfat mode
   $ mkdir /tmp/sharevvfat
   $ touch /tmp/sharevvfat/hostfoo
4. start your guest with the path as vvfat set to share (ro for now)
   Append the following to your qemu cmdline:
     -drive format=vvfat,file=fat:/tmp/sharevvfat/,if=virtio
   check the block device content by mounting it and verifyinf that "hostfoo" is there
5. shutdown the guest to retry rw
6. For rw append it as:
     -drive format=vvfat,file=fat:rw:/tmp/sharevvfat/,if=virtio

I have echoed some content into a file, and while the update policy isn't instand after my guest shut down I could access on the host what the guest put there.
All worked fine, but it seems it was already failing in the background on guest shutdown I see the failing assertion and the guest data is not written correctly to the Host.

Retrying on a newer qemu than Xenial confirmed that there the same case is working.

If there are no blockers uncovered on the way I will merge this with the ongoing qemu SRU.
That means that a test builds will soon be available in https://launchpad.net/~ci-train-ppa-service/+archive/ubuntu/2697

Added SRU Template and tested 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.13 from the bileto ppa.

Bug is fixed, content can be written from the guest and is re-readable from there as well as on the Host.

That said pushed to the SRU unapproved queue.

Hi guys,

coming back from vacation last week, sorry for not replying before and.... tons of thanks for your prompt support and resolution!

BTW, by any chance, do you guys know what the status for a "bootsector=<path to file>" parameter for the VVFAT is?

Rolando

Hi,
I haven't touched on anything that would bring much more features to the vvfat code.
In general it is a helper to sync data, but it is brittle I'd not even so much like to see a bootsector support there. That I don't find anything doesn't mean there is nothing, if you know an upstream commit or discussion feel free to catch me, but if possible in a new bug or via IRC.

On this particular bug here we now wait for the SRU Team to accept that, the bug here on Lauchpad will get an update that it has to be verified to work (I'd totally appreciate your help there) and then it can be released into the stable release.

Sure, no problem Christian!

BTW, I just updated my system and got this qemu version:
>>> QEMU emulator version 2.5.0 (Debian 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.11), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard
but the issue is still there:
>>> qemu-system-x86_64: /build/qemu-iZpOAh/qemu-2.5+dfsg/block/vvfat.c:2290: commit_direntries: Assertion `!strncmp(s->directory.pointer, "QEMU", 4)' failed.
>>> Aborted (core dumped)

However, downloading and running the patched version you mentioned above from:
>>> https://launchpadlibrarian.net/316972847/qemu-system-x86_2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.13_amd64.deb
does work perfectly!

Thanks Christian and don't hesitate to let me know once it gets accepted and included. I'll "apt-get update" my system and let you know the outcome.

Again, thanks,
Rolando

Subscribing Marc so he can easily track once this SRU passes.

Hello Rolando, or anyone else affected,

Accepted qemu into xenial-proposed. The package will build now and be available at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.13 in a few hours, and then in the -proposed repository.

Please help us by testing this new package.  See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed for documentation on how to enable and use -proposed.Your feedback will aid us getting this update out to other Ubuntu users.

If this package fixes the bug for you, please add a comment to this bug, mentioning the version of the package you tested, and change the tag from verification-needed to verification-done. If it does not fix the bug for you, please add a comment stating that, and change the tag to verification-failed.  In either case, details of your testing will help us make a better decision.

Further information regarding the verification process can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/PerformingSRUVerification .  Thank you in advance!

Hi Robie,

I think something is wrong with the build you mention.

Still can't install it by means of:
>>> apt-get -s install qemu-system-x86/xenial-proposed
>>> apt-get -s install qemu-system/xenial-proposed
or
>>> apt-get -s install qemu-kvm/xenial-proposed
but issuing a:
>>> wget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/amd64/qemu-system-x86/1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.13
gives me, after renaming it, this error:
>>> ./patched-qemu 
>>> ./patched-qemu: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
>>> ./patched-qemu: line 1: `<!DOCTYPE html>'
>>>
>>> ./patched-qemu --version
>>> ./patched-qemu: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
>>> ./patched-qemu: line 1: `<!DOCTYPE html>'

Please note that I download *just* the qemu-system-x86 binary and nothing else than that.

HTH,
Rolando

Hi guys,

sorry, my bad! Downloaded the wrong file, the correct one is:
>>> http://launchpadlibrarian.net/318154621/qemu-system-x86_2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.13_amd64.deb

So, I checked it and, yes, it works fine!

I got this errors but I think they are correct as I'm just pointing to the new binary instead of re-installing all the files for the package:
>>> Failed to initialize module: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qemu/block-iscsi.so
>>> Note: only modules from the same build can be loaded.
>>> Failed to initialize module: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qemu/block-curl.so

>>> Note: only modules from the same build can be loaded.
>>> Failed to initialize module: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qemu/block-dmg.so
>>> Note: only modules from the same build can be loaded.

So, again, thank you guys very much!

I might be opening a new bug to request the backport of the boot record code (I need to find out where it was though...)

Thanks,
Rolando


Hi guys,

unfortunatelly, I hit an issue with this patched version: there seems to be some issues, at least for LEAF (Linux Embedded Appliance Framework - https://sourceforge.net/projects/leaf).

Previous steps to reproduce (LEAF image creation):
	# This download is ~110M:
	wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/leaf/Bering-uClibc/6.0.3/Bering-uClibc_6.0.3_x86_64_syslinux_serial115200.tar.gz
	qemu-img create -f qcow2 bering-own.qcow2 256M
	modprobe nbd
	qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 bering-own.qcow2
	# Use fdisk to create a type c (FAT32 LBA) bootable partition like this:
	#	Device      Boot Start    End Sectors  Size Id Type
	#	/dev/nbd0p1 *     2048 524287  522240  255M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
	fdisk /dev/nbd0
	mkfs.vfat -n BERING -F 32 /dev/nbd0p1
	syslinux -i /dev/nbd0p1
	dd conv=notrunc bs=440 count=1 if=/usr/lib/SYSLINUX/mbr.bin of=/dev/nbd0
	mount /dev/nbd0p1 /mnt/
	tar -C /mnt -zxvf ./Bering-uClibc_6.0.3_x86_64_syslinux_serial115200.tar.gz

Not using the VVFAT it works OK:
	./patched-qemu-christian-OK/qemu-system-x86_64\
	 -nodefaults -nographic -localtime -enable-kvm -smp 1 -m 512 -serial stdio\
	 -drive if=ide,file=bering-own.qcow2\
	 -kernel /mnt/syslinux/linux -initrd /mnt/initrd.lrp\
	 -append 'rw root=/dev/ram0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 VERBOSE=1 PKGPATH=/dev/sda1:vfat LRP=root,license,local'
	# Type all this to shutdown LEAF:
	# root + [ENTER] + [ENTER] + q + poweroff

However, when using the VVFAT emulation:
	./patched-qemu-christian-OK/qemu-system-x86_64\
	 -nodefaults -nographic -localtime -enable-kvm -smp 1 -m 512 -serial stdio\
	 -drive if=ide,file=fat:rw:/mnt\
	 -kernel /mnt/syslinux/linux -initrd /mnt/initrd.lrp\
	 -append 'rw root=/dev/ram0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 VERBOSE=1 PKGPATH=/dev/sda1:vfat LRP=root,license,local'
LEAF displays these errors:
	LINUXRC: Mounted /dev/sda1 as vfat
	LINUXRC: Installing -  root: dev: /dev/sda1 mnt: /mnt1 t: vfat f: /mnt1/root.lrp /dev/sda1gunzip: invalid magic

	LINUXRC: Squashfs mount failed!
	LINUXRC: loading modules from /etc/modules
	sed: /etc/modules: No such file or directory

To somehow debug it, I added the VVFAT as a second IDE HDD while using the qcow disk image as the primary boot drive:
	./patched-qemu-christian-OK/qemu-system-x86_64\
	 -nodefaults -nographic -localtime -enable-kvm -smp 1 -m 512 -serial stdio\
	 -drive if=ide,file=bering-own.qcow2,index=0\
	 -drive if=ide,file=fat:rw:/mnt\
	 -kernel /mnt/syslinux/linux -initrd /mnt/initrd.lrp\
	 -append 'rw root=/dev/ram0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 VERBOSE=1 PKGPATH=/dev/sda1:vfat LRP=root,license,local'
	# => root + {ENTER] + [ENTER] + q 
Then, get errors when mounting the VVFAT disk partition (but it gets mounted...) as well as when trying to display a sub-dir of it:

Hi Rolando,
there are further changes in this build - we need to exclude that you are seeing this just due to only downloading the .deb file instead of enabling proposed to gain all required dependencies.

You can instead of an full "apt upgrade" also run rather selective upgrades.
I'd recommend
1. enabling proposed
2. call apt upgrade to check what is available but then abort
3. call apt install "<qemu packages you saw in step #2"
   # this will pull in all dependencies

Hi Rolando,
we really should stick to here verify the issue that we fixed (the vvfat rw fail) and after you gave me a 50%-heartache :-) I verified proposed on my own now.

It just works via
1. echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial-proposed restricted main multiverse universe" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
2. apt update
3. apt install qemu-block-extra qemu-kvm qemu-system-common qemu-system-x86 qemu-utils

Now (re)-start your vvfat guest and it will work to write to the vvfat disk.
It did so for me at least.


I read through the issue you are seeing now and that is IMHO as a TL;DR saying "the vvfat emulation of a directory is not matching mounting it directly in the guest.
Am I right with that the summary of above is
1. create empty fat (not vvfat) image bering-own.qcow2
compare running
a) mount image to /mnt and append it as vvfat to the guest
vs
b) pass the qcow file itself as a drive to the guest
If I'm correct in reading what you do that is a totally different case.
If you look at the code [1] and some doc [2]+[3] you'll see that this driver is very restricted.
I'd never use it (or have seen it used) as root file system, not even for something critical other than simple data sharing between win guests and the host.
Quoting:
What you should never do:
- use non-ASCII filenames ;
- use "-snapshot" together with ":rw:" ;
- expect it to work when loadvm‚Äôing ;
- write to the FAT directory on the host system while accessing it with the guest system.

There are slight improvements in [4], but also see the discussion [3] which ended as Won't Fix.

Quoting from [3] is good as well: "vfat is a last-resort quick-n-dirty fix for a problem when you have a guest which doesn't have any other ways to communicate except of a fat image (read: a floppy).  In all other cases just don't use it."

[1]: https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/block/vvfat.c
[2]: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/QEMU/Devices/Storage
[3]: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=419929
[4]: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1599539


All that said for the initially reported issue I can confirm that the bug is fixed and verified in proposed. Further insufficiencies of vfat would be another bug, but actually more upstream development work. If you open a new one I'm happy to discuss, but unlikely will find the time to do the related dev work.

Hi Christian,

Ok, understood. And, yes, you are correct: basically I create a qcow image file and then:
- Bering works fine when passing qemu the qcow image file to be used as the HDD
- Bering doesn't work when mounting the same qcow image file and then launching qemu to access those same files from the mount point.

Please note that the issue happens while meeting all this conditions (already known by me):
  What you should never do:
  - use non-ASCII filenames ;
  - use "-snapshot" together with ":rw:" ;
  - expect it to work when loadvm‚Äôing ;
  - write to the FAT directory on the host system while accessing it with the guest system.

Anyways, will open a new bug for this LEAF/Bering issue but, I agree with you, in that this feature should be used with caution, at least for now, as it seems to be still quite buggy.

Thanks Christian!

Thank you all very much guys!

I'm on a business travel but will install update it as soon as I get back home.

Hi Christian,
