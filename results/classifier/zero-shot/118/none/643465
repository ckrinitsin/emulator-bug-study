Crash at network boot

When I boot on lan, I crash qemu:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

Hi,

The backtrace shows it crashes in lsi_update_irq() which is in the SCSI emulation, not the
networking code. Please try and see if this happens if you use IDE or virtio-blk for your
disk drives.

Second, please provide proper information about your software stack:
- kernel version
- qemu-kvm version
- Linux distro
- hardware config

Whan I put vga card it work perfectly. I have only the bug with wmware card and particulare version of linux
- vanilla 2.6.32.22
- 0.12.5-r1
- gentoo
- core i5 750
Guest:
- gentoo kernel (based on vanilla kernel 2.6.32.16)
- VMware SVGA video driver 11.0.1
- network boot via pxe and squashfs + aufs + tmpfs



That is really odd, it sounds like memory corruption in the vmware video driver.

QEMU 0.12 is very out of date nowadays, so it's unlikely that somebody will still have a look at this ticket => I'm closing this ticket now. If you still have problems with the latest version of QEMU, please feel free to open this ticket again (or a new one).
