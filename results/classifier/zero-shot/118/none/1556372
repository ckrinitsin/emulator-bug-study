Superfluous popup on Cocoa to verify quit, cannot be disabled.

This patch severely reduces the quality of life for developers using QEMU in a rapid Edit-Compile-Test cycle.
Any method of quitting QEMU via the UI triggers this dialogue, whose default option is "cancel" -- necessitating the use of the mouse to click "Confirm".

This dialogue cannot be disabled by any flag, and is highly annoying. Recommend a flag to disable this confirmation, or in fact disable it by default and enable it with a flag.

Patch in question:

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2015-09/msg05031.html

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
