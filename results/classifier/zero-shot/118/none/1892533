Meson: Missing config-host.mak

Wanted to give a try to the new build system, but a simple "meson build" gives that error:

meson.build:15:0: ERROR: Failed to load /home/xclaesse/programmation/qemu/build/config-host.mak: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/xclaesse/programmation/qemu/build/config-host.mak'

configure does not seems to work better:

build$ ../configure 
../configure: 232: shift: can't shift that many


Meson is still hidden, you need to use ../configure.

"can't shift that many" will be fixed shortly (patch already on the list).

btw, I'm surprised README does not mention meson, shouldn't you instruct that it's a build-dep? Maybe suggest pip install command?

QEMU ships with the appropriate version of Meson included (see the "meson" directory), that's why it is not mentioned in the README.

Anyway, does any of your build problems still persist with QEMU v6.0? Or could we close this ticket now?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
