Persistent malfunction after guest shutdown/reboot

Running the VM the first time after the host has booted up is completely fine, no issues at all. However, after shutting down or restarting the VM, certain problems occur. In the Windows 10 VM, it may throw a SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION error on bootup, and other times it simply won't use the VirtIO drive. Before the latest update of QEMU 2.5.0, I have had no problems.

Recently, I've also downgraded my kernel in order to solve some problems related to Haswell. This is probably the same time I've got the 2.5.0 update. When I did this, I could no longer boot into my main image due to similar problems. I've had to also update the VirtIO storage driver with a new image installation. Before I figured that everything worked fine on a host reboot, the installer would spit out an error that it could not modify the partitions of the drive. Everything else worked fine with SATA or IDE configuration, but not VirtIO. I shouldn't need to restart my computer after shutting down the computer.

I've tried using QEMU with the latest Linux kernel (4.4.x) with the exact same result.

Here is what I have configured:
- Arch Linux with linux-lts (4.1.19-1-lts)
- QEMU 2.5.0
- VirtIO drivers v 0.1.113
- Windows 10 from MSDN
- vfio PCI Passthrough of NVIDIA 970

I'm not sure how to get any more logs so if you need more info I'll be glad to provide it



I've just recently experienced drive corruption and BIOS issues. After a reformat (to ext4 from f2fs), a BIOS re-flash and reinstall with linux-lts, this issue isn't appearing anymore so it was an issue specific to me.
