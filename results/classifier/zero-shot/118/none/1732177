SBSA ACS test freezes inside qemu-system-aarch64

In an effort to get Windows 10 for ARM64 (which is supposed to boot on SBSA/SBBR-compliant platforms) to boot inside qemu, I tried to run the SBSA ACS test suite. I used the UEFI image from the latest Linaro snapshot, and built the SBSA ACS UEFI application from https://github.com/ARM-software/sbsa-acs myself using a Linaro aarch64 compiler.

Test #8 causes an infinite exception loop, as the exception vectors themselves somehow become inaccessible, and accessing them triggers another exception to be handled by the same vector. (With some older Linaro UEFI images, the hard lockup is avoided, and the SBSA UEFI app crashes instead.) If I disable that test, the testsuite locks up in other tests in very similar ways. We aren't even able to get a pass/fail score from the app because of this.

Which version of QEMU did you test? Does it work better with the latest version of QEMU now?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
