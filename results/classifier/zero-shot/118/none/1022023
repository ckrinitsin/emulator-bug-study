vga/std lacks few wide screen modes.

hi,
i have noticed that qemu-1.0.1 doesn't support few widescreen modes on -vga std, e.g. 1680x1050, 1600x1000, 1440x900.
i have a few laptops with kvm and i would like to work with qemu windows guest native full wide screen mode.
could you please add these modes?

small correction, 16080x1050 is supported but there's no support for 1600x1000 and 1600x900.

There are more requests in other bug tickets:

- 1366x768 (from https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1054558)

- 1080 wide x 1920 high (from https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1665789)

... so these should be considered, too, I think.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
