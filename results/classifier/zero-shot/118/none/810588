Unexpected crash of qemu-kvm with SCSI disk emulation.

Virual machine with MS windows 2003 installed on the virtual scsi disk (-drive file=/my/path/myimage.qcow2.img,boot=on,if=scsi,media=disk,bus=0,unit=1) unexpectedly crashes without core dump. When the image is connected as an ide disk (-hda )  vm flies normally.
Qemu-kvm version: 0.12.5
Os/distr.: Debian squeeze, x86_64

Please post your full QEMU command-line.

Did you enable core dumps before launch QEMU?  Do "ulimit -c
unlimited" in the same shell before running the QEMU command-line.

If it is exiting instead of crashing I suggest launching QEMU from gdb
and catching the exit:
1. Install qemu-kvm-dbg to get the debuginfo for useful backtraces
2. Start gdb with QEMU and its usual command-line arguments: gdb
--args qemu-kvm ...
3. Set breakpoints on exit(3) and abort(2):
b exit
b abort
4. Run the VM and reproduce the exit:
r
5. When it exits you will hopefully be at an exit/abort breakpoint and
can print the stack trace:
bt

Please post the backtrace so we have more information on how the exit happens.

Thanks,
Stefan
