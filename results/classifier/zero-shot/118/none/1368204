WinME isn't able to detect QEMU's cdrom drive and other hard drives automatically

On a fresh installation of Windows Millennium (WinME) in qemu, Windows Me isn't able to find the CD-ROM drive or additional hard drives other than -hda at first place.

Only if i add manually an IDE controller driver in Windows ME's device manager, the CD-ROM inserted in QEMU is found.
Thus an IDE controller isn't found automatically either.

This shouldn't be the case. On normal real hardware, Windows ME would find at least one IDE or SCSI controller.

The command line that was used is the following:
sudo /usr/bin/qemu-system-i386 -hda WinME_QEMU.img -cdrom drivers.iso -boot c -no-acpi -no-hpet -soundhw sb16 -net nic -cpu pentium3 -m 256 -vga cirrus   

qemu's version is:
qemu-system-i386 --version

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

As far as i can remember, this bug was still valid with QEMU version 2.5.0 shipped with Kubuntu 16.04.
I am planning to switch to Kubuntu 18.04 in the next couple of weeks. There i can test it with QEMU version 2.11.x.
