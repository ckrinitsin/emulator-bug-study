GTK3 interface doesn't zoom-to-fit by default

The SDL interface automatically scales the video output to
match the window size.  The GTK3 interface has an off-by-default option
"Zoom To Fit" for that.  As far as I can tell, no command-line option
exists to turn that option on.  That makes it harder to quickly zoom a
freshly launched VM; instead of just hitting a maximize-window hotkey, I
also have to navigate through the menu to select "Zoom To Fit".

Given that VMs typically start out running in a much lower-resolution
video mode than the host (and VMs not running a full graphical
environment often stay that way), this seriously impacts the usability
of qemu-system.

(Observed in QEMU 2.8)

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
