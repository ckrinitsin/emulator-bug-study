Arrow keys press is double in some programs in Dos

Hello,
im trying to use Qemu for Dos machines.

 But there is problem with some programs that arrow key press is double in some problems. As advanced Filemanagers - Dos Navigator or File Wizard, same Scandisk.

There is gif:

 Its blocking to use such problem, unless you use Numlock key for it, but im used 25+ years to arrow keys and its bug.. I guess that it would mess with some games too.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
