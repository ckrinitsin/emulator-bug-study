QEMU Windows fails to mount rootfs on an ISO where QEMU Linux works normally

I have installed QEMU 3.1.0 for Microsoft Windows from https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/ . When I give the command "qemu-system-x86_64.exe -cdrom ..\QemuSaver\freeduc2.iso", qemu boots the ISO, but the resulting Linux kernel panics when trying to mount the root file system. Running the equivalent command under Linux (OpenSuSE Leap 15.0) results in success.
I will attach a screenshot of the command and the kernel panic message.
To reproduce the problem, download the zip file from Google Drive here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bAozvGeRF7PbkOnJKzrFHxhUh2kDLz6L/view?usp=sharing, and unpack it under Microsoft Windows. You can either run the installer (which will install QEMU 3.0.0 and an ISO image in C:\QemuSaver) or you can run the command I gave from the directory where your QEMU is installed.



This fails on Windows 7 and on Windows 10.
I have had success with different ISO files.

This turned out to be not enough memory allocated to the virtual machine. When I added "-m 1024" to the parameters, all was well.

Ok, thanks for the update. So I'm closing this now.
