coreaudio not working on MacOS

OS: MacOS Catalina 10.15.2

qemu-system-x86_64 -version
QEMU emulator version 4.2.50 (v4.2.0-13-g084a398bf8-dirty)

Qemu install via brew: brew install qemu

I use following to install Ubuntu 18.04 desktop successfully:-

IMG_CD=$HOME/Downloads/iso/ubuntu-18.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso
IMG_FILE=$HOME/code/vm/qemu/u64d01.qcow2

\
-cdrom $IMG_CD

Removing the last -cdrom line Ubuntu desktop boot up and everything work perfectly except the audio.

I test with wav audio driver by replacing the -audiodev line as follow, which save the client audio to a wave file, like below and it work perfectly:

-audiodev wav,id=snd0,path=$HOME/qemu.wav

I start the vm, open firefox and play a few video, then shutdown the vm. Then I can play the qemu.wav file and all the audio was recorded there.

However, I can't get audio directly with coreaudio.

First thing to check is whether you have any other audio applications installed, since there seems to be a long running issue whereby other applications can prevent QEMU from being able to output audio. See https://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=8848&sid=1e5fab3a08347beb3b344be0f953221e&start=150#p60978 for a discussion on this.

Secondly does QEMU 4.1 audio work? There has been a report on list that there is an issue caused by conversion to the new backend audio APIs in 4.2 here: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-01/msg02142.html.


I am not using any audio enhancing software.

I start trying qemu + Ubuntu Desktop a few weeks ago and put all configurations together last week, so I never try coreaudio on 4.1.

I recently test it again, coreaudio is working on 4.1.1, 4.2 and 5rc1 on MacOS.

It is working now. Tested with 4.1.1, 4.2 and 5rc1.
