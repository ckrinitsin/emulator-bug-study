qemu-0.13.0-r2 special keys different when using -alt-grab

I use -alt-grab with qemu-0.13.0-r2 and special keys like Ctrl-Alt-f for full screen did not work for me with a windows guest. They work normally when omitting the -alt-grab startup parameter.

After quite a long time, I found out that I have to add the shift key to the keys from the documentation when I use the -alt-grab option.

Probably -ctrl-grab behaves similarly. It would be really nice to have this documented in the default documentation in the man page as has not been documented there yet.

Hi,

Thanks for reporting this issue - sorry it takes a while to get these addressed.

I've looked at the code, and the modifiers are handled specially depending on the command line option, so I think it is the intended behaviour. I've update the docs (and submitted a patch) to make it clearer.

Thank you!

Comment #1 sounds like this issue has been dealt with? Is there still something left that needs to be fixed here?
