Makefile BUG in edk2 firmware install 4.1.0-rc3

DESTDIR installs end up with wrong paths in JSON files installed to $prefix/share/qemu/firmware. For example, the file:

  50-edk2-x86_64-secure.json

ends up incorrectly with:

  "filename": "/build/qemu/pkg/qemu/usr/share/qemu/edk2-x86_64-secure-code.fd",

instead of the correct:

  "filename": "/usr/share/qemu/edk2-x86_64-secure-code.fd",

Related to commit 26ce90fde5c.

What distribution/version are you using?

I'm on Arch, but that shouldn't matter. It's a clear bug in the Makefile.

I note that Fedora doesn't ship these blobs as they're provide by separate edk2 package. 

Attached patch fixes it for me.

The same issue was reported and patched on qemu-devel by Olaf Hering two months ago. The patch received three Reviewed-by tags, but nobody bothered to queue it.

[Qemu-devel] [PATCH v1] Makefile: remove DESTDIR from firmware file cont

The thread is split over two months, hence two links below, into the mailing list archive:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-05/msg07093.html
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-06/msg00690.html

There shouldn't be a need to post a new patch, just for someone to pick up what's been posted already.

Phil: "get_maintainer.pl" reports no official owners for the root Makefile, but you come out on top as commit-signer (26/70). Can you pick this one up, please? Thanks!

Fixed in commit 177cd674d620 ("Makefile: remove DESTDIR from firmware file content", 2019-08-03), part of v4.1.0-rc4.
