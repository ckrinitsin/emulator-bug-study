Unable to create or revert snapshots

With an update to Qemu (3.1.x) I am unable to revert snapshots using virt-manager or virsh. Virtual Machines existing before the update seem to function properly. It is only after creating a new machine that snapshots are misbehaving. I tested spinning up vms of tumbleweed, leap15, and ubuntu 18.04. Each of them had the following issues:

- With the machine running, live reversions act like they apply, but no changes are actually made.
- With the machine paused, reversion also does not apply.
- With the machine turned off, reversion is not possible. Virsh is unable to find the snapshot, and virt-manager errors out with:

Error running snapshot 'FreshInstall': internal error: qemu unexpectedly closed the monitor: 2019-01-15T19:19:46.020247Z qemu-system-x86_64: Device 'drive-virtio-disk0' does not have the requested snapshot 'FreshInstall'

After doing some digging, the error occurs because of the following commit:

Adding System Information

Before kernel 4.20.x this was not an issue as nested virtualization was not enabled by default. In any distribution using 4.20.x or later, snapshots and migration do not work.

Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU and libvirt? Anyway, since the problem occurs with libvirt, have you already tried to report this issue to the libvirt project instead?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
