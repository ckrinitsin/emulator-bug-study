no-shutdown does not fire SHUTDOWN event for some guests

Currently using: qemu-x86_64 version 2.0.0
Steps to reproduce: Create virtual machine with the arguments -no-shutdown, such as used by libvirt. Attach to the json event system. Load a guest such as Ubuntu 14.04 and run the 'halt' command. Guest ceases to execute, qemu freezes CPUs however no SHUTDOWN event is fired to the monitor.

Now load a guest such as finnix or Debian 7. Run the same sequence of steps and note that the SHUTDOWN event is fired to the monitor.

This seems like a qemu bug as the execution of the guest has ceased.

Thanks
Michael
