Desktop background messed up when running Raring in a QEMU-based virtual machine

Screenshot attached.

Problem occurs only when choosing the default cirrus graphics card. The other graphics cards do not show this problem but are very unstable.

The screenshot is of the whole desktop with a Virtual Machine Manager window containing the desktop of the VM. You see that its actual background is messed up and also the background images which you can choose when right-clicking the background and choosing "Change Desktop Background".



It does not matter whether the host machine is Quantal or Raring, currently my host machine is Raring, so I can easily test Raring packages for the fix of this bug.

Thanks I'll try to reproduce later tonight.

For additional info see the files attached to bug 1157066, they are for the same virtual machine.

I see this behavior over vnc as well.  The desktop is rendered correctly using spice.  You can use that by adding eg

   -vga qxl -spice port=5990,disable-ticketing

and connect using

   spicy -h localhost -p 5990

I also don't get this with the vmware vga driver.  The background is fine for that with both sdl and vnc.

(lowering priority since there are more than one workarounds)

Sorry, I had misread the original description and thought you said the other graphics cards *also* showed this problem :)

Thanks again for submitting this bug.  I'll test against upstream qemu to see if we can report this there.

Also reproduced with git://git.qemu.org/qemu.git (using vga -cirrus)

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

This did never occur again for me. So this can get closed.
