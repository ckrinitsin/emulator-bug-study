Solaris on KVM/QEMU: WARNING rtls0: Failure resetting PHY

When running Solaris (both version 10 and 11) on a QEMU/KVM virtual host, the Solaris guest displays this warning just after starting the system:
WARNING rtls0: Failure resetting PHY.

Although the networking seems to work fine.

I have this network device model selected for the Solaris guest: rtl8139

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
