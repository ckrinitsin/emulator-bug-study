Addressing Limitations with 64GB RAM on virt-9.2 Machine Type in QEMU 9.1.93
Description of problem:
When attempting to run a VM with 64GB of RAM using the `virt-9.2` machine type, QEMU encounters an error related to addressing limitations. It appears that the memory configuration exceeds the 32-bit addressing limit.

Error output:
**qemu-system-aarch64: Addressing limited to 32 bits, but memory exceeds it by 65498251264 bytes**
Steps to reproduce:
1. Build QEMU from source on macOS (M2 MacBook, arm64).
2. Run the command with the `virt-9.2` machine type and 64GB of RAM.
Additional information:
- Changes in [UTM app](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases) for release v4.6.2 - (macOS) Support > 32GiB RAM configurations in QEMU ([#5537](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/5537))
- Although the site advertises release of qemu-9.2.0-rc3, the brew install doesn't install the latest version yet.
- The QEMU build environment includes dependencies installed via Homebrew: libffi, gettext, glib, pkg-config, pixman, ninja, meson, sdl2, gtk+3, gnu-tar.
