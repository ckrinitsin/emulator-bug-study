Ctrl Alt G -- Multiple Virtual Machines

I'm using Fedora 22.

Firstly, what works:
A single VM instance, running Windows. Although, I am keeping this (GTK) window focused.

What really fails:
If I have two running VM's, WIndows XP and Windows Vista:
1. I press Ctrl-Alt-G to get the focus.
2. That works first time.
3. Then I press Ctrl-Alt-G again.
4. Then Alt-Tab to the other machine (switching from XP to Vista, or back.)
5. Then press Ctrl-Alt-G to gain focus:
- Problem is that now the Ctrl-Alt-G, although showing in the title bar, only grabs the mouse, but NOT the keyboard. That is to say, whilst in Ctrl-Alt-G mode the second time, pressing Alt-Tab jumps back to the other VM!

Pressing Alt-F4 quits!!!!!!!!!!!!! Regardless of whether Ctrl-Alt-G mode or not!
But only when running two VM's.

Thanks

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU (version 3.0)? Which window manager were you using here?
