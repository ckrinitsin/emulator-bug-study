AMD Athlon(tm) X2 Dual-Core QL-64 bug

I upgrade my qemu 2.12.0-2 => 3.0.0-1. After that I can't load virtual machine with "-cpu host" option. Full command line is
qemu-system-x86_64 \
	-monitor stdio \
	-enable-kvm \
	-cpu host \
	-smp cpus=2 \
	-m 1G \
	-vga virtio \
	-display gtk,gl=on \
	-soundhw ac97 \
	-drive file=/ehdd/qemu/arch_hw_12_08_2018/arch_shrinked.raw,format=raw,if=virtio
I have Arch Linux on virtual machine. When I start QEMU, GRUB tries to load initial ramdisk and stops. System doesn't load. If I try to start virtual machine with "-cpu athlon" option then get the same bug.
I downgrade back to qemu 2.12.0-2 and virtual machine works fine, system loads.
My processor is AMD Athlon(tm) X2 Dual-Core QL-64.

Hi Kirill,
  That's a bit tricky to debug; could you build qemu from git and try and bisect between 2.12.0 and 3.0 to see which commit broke it?

Yes I could, but it rebuilds too long. I will report results later, when find broke commit.

I try to bisect git version. When I run git bisect bad v3.0.0 it says:
Bisecting: 1298 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:

Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting
Something is wrong, isn't it?

I can't do bisect, but I have installed qemu version 3.0.50 (v3.0.0-614-g19b599f766-dirty) from git and this works fine.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
