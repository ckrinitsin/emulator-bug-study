SDL2 interface didn't follow the current X11 keyboard layout for hotkeys

My X11 was configured to use Dvorak keyboard layout, with setxkbmap(1). Despite the window title said 'Press Ctrl-Alt-G to exit grab' after it grabbed the mouse, pressing this hotkey don't have any effects, and I has to switch to a virtual terminal to kill(1) that qemu process. By debugging the program I found it is using the raw key code to handle the key events, so I must use CTRL-ALT-I to exit the grab, in my keyboard.

Also affects SDL 1.2 UI in QEMU 2.12.1

I'm currently reverted the commit f8d2c9369b8302f65f4f43f14ed3987c2268a02a to use only CTRL-ALT.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
