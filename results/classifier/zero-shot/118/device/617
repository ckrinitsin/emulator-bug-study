USB passthrough with Conbee 2 failing after upgrade to Fedora 34 / Libvirt 7.0.0
Description of problem:
Hi,

I upgraded recently from Fedora 32 to 34.

For a little under a year, I've been running reliably a Home Assistant instance with Deconz add-on in a VM, with a Conbee 2 zigbee gateway in USB passthrough, controlling about 15 devices (door/window sensors, thermometers, leak sensors and push buttons).

It has worked flawlessly but stopped working after upgrading Fedora. The Conbee shows up on the Linux guest but the serial can't be read by the Deconz application and it just does not work, the app can't get past the device connection screen.

This is the state of what works and what doesn't:

- Home Assistant Linux VM: NOK
- Ubuntu Linux 20.04 VM: NOK
- Windows 10 VM: NOK
- Windows 10 physical machine: OK, can connect and pair a door sensor

All running the latest Deconz app.

The fact that the physical Windows machine works excludes a bricked device. I used the physical Windows to upgrade the Conbee 2 firmware with no improvement. 

This does not seem to be an isolated issue: https://old.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/o04sgw/conbee_ii_usb_passthrough_with_libvirt_660/

Apologies if this has already been reported. Let me know what kind of logs you might want.

Thanks!
