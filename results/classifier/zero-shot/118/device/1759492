suspend/resume is not supported for vm with tpm device

I have used libvirt with qemu to create a vm with tpm device, when I suspend the vm and resume it, libvirt will
raise error:
libvirtError: internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: Enter char_pty_open
I find some materials:
https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/TPM
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2015-05/msg05355.html
They present qemu haven't supported tpm suspend/resume, Does someone have any advice on how to resolve the problem?

qemu version: 2.10.2
vm image version: centos 7.2

Thanks

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
