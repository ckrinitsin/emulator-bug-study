qemu-system-ppc no longer able to read real cdrom

When I use to send the -cdrom /dev/cdrom option to QEMU, I would be able to use a real cdrom. With QEMU v2.0.0, real cdroms don't work. A quick look at the output from the "info block" command shows this:

ide1-cd0: /dev/cdrom (raw, read-only)
      Removable device: not locked, tray closed

This indicates that the cdrom is set to /dev/cdrom. I remember versions of QEMU prior to 1.5 were able to use a real cdrom. 

qemu-system-ppc is being run on Mac OS 10.6.8.

According to https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/588691 CD-ROM drives should be working again, so I assume we can close this bug nowadays? Or can you still reproduce it with the latest version of QEMU?

I cannot reproduce this issue with QEMU. This report can now be closed. Thank you.
