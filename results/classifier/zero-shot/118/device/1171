tulip: DMA reentrancy issue leads to stack overflow (CVE-2022-2962)
Description of problem:
A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the tulip emulation. When tulip reads or writes to  rx/tx descriptor ( tulip_desc_read/write ) or copies  rx/tx frame(tulip_copy_rx_bytes / tulip_copy_tx_buffers), it doesn't check whether the destination address is its own MMIO address. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.
