Extend uefi-test-tools to report SMBIOS location

UEFI helper app exposes the pointer to RSDP ACPI table that firmware allocates in guest's RAM
but it doesn't do so for SMBIOS tables. Hence bios table test would skip testing SMBIOS tables
to workaround shortcoming. This bug is a request to expose two new entry point fields (one for SMBIOS 2 and another for SMBIOS 3) so test could check SMBIOS tables when guest is started a with  UEFI firmware.

Discussion on qemu-devel:

I'll work on this once Igor's above series is merged (which in turn depends on my series
