Infinite loop in xhci_ring_chain_length() in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c (CVE-2020-14394)
Description of problem:
An infinite loop issue was found in the USB xHCI controller emulation of QEMU. Specifically, function `xhci_ring_chain_length()` in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c may get stuck while fetching empty TRBs from guest memory, since the exit conditions of the loop depend on values that are fully controlled by guest. A privileged guest user may exploit this issue to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.
Steps to reproduce:
Build and load `xhci.ko` from within the guest:

1) make
2) insmod xhci.ko
