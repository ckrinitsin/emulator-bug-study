libfdt.a git compilation fail

I don't know the commit tags but I checked out dtc on the 28 of october at 20:27 in the tree of qemu (also git checkout out tonight). The compilation fail at line 234 in qemu/dtc/Makefile so I inserted that line:

@$ /usr/bin/strace -o /usr/src/qemu_build/error.log.txt /usr/bin/ar $@

into the makefile at position 234 to see what is the exact problem but the strace log is inconclusive.

for the error: /usr/bin/ar: deux operations différentes spécifiées

liberal translation is: two different operation specified.

the distribution is arch linux with binutils 2.23.2, gcc 4.8.2 and kernel kvm-3.12.0-rc5 from git.



Which version of make are you using? Recently, a bug with make 4.0 has been discovered, please see this thread for a description and a work-around:

I am indeed using make v4.0. Thanks you very much for the email thread, I will try to compile qemu again.

This should be working fine again with recent versions of QEMU, so I'm closing the bug. If you still have problems, feel free to open it again.
