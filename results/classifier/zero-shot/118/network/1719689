[feature request] add flag to treat warnings as errors

Since booting could potentially take a lot of time and warnings are likely to indicate that something is wrong, it would be useful to have a command line flag which would abort the boot if there are any warnings.

An example might be network configuration. The following output most likely indicates that there is something the user has to fix before starting and being able to use the guest os. 

Warning: hub port hub0port0 has no peer
Warning: vlan 0 with no nics
Warning: netdev hub0port0 has no peer
Warning: requested NIC (anonymous, model vitrio-net-device) was not created (not supported by this machine?)

Ideally, there would be an option the user could pass which would cause qemu to print these warnings then exit, rather than boot the kernel.

Alternatively, or additionally, a dry run option would be helpful for the same purpose: making sure qemu get to the booting the kernel stage with everything in working order so that you do not have to wait for the kernel to boot and then shut down while debugging things like networking (things which can be debugged (at least partially) without booting, or trying to boot, the guest os).

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
