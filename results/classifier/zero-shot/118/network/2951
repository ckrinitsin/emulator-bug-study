First byte of USB NIC is hardcoded to 0x40
Description of problem:
Incus recently added support for USB attached network interfaces.
As with any network device, we generate a MAC address (using our MAC OUI) and allow the user to override that to a value of their choice.

That's when we noticed that no matter what MAC address we set, the resulting MAC always has the prefix swapped to "40:". Looking into the code, this is done on purpose here:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/hw/usb/dev-network.c?ref_type=heads#L1386

Unfortunately there is no comment in the code or in any of the commits touching that code as far as why that is.

We've also looked at the libvirt code handling those devices and that code seems to also assume that a user provided MAC will be correctly passed through to the guest, no mention of the odd prefix override.

This is a bit concerning as there are valid IEEE OUI with the "40:" prefix.
So this means that QEMU may be generating collisions with actual physical MAC addresses...

For a few months now, I've been applying this small patch to my own Incus packages (which bundle QEMU) and haven't heard or seen any obvious issue from the change.

Does anyone know why this hardcoded MAC address prefix exists?
