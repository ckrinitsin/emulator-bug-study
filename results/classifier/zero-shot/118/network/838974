Confusing error report for missing vde support

The error that appears in qemu 0.15 is "parameter 'type' expects a network client type" when trying to use vde for networking as if the parameter is wrong, but the problem is that the executable was compiled without vde support.

Thanks for reporting this bug.

That certainly could be confusing.  However, practically speaking, since qemu was compiled without that support, it becomes more difficult for qemu to tell the difference between a unsupported but otherwise-valid type, and an invalid type.

Perhaps upstream would accept a (trivial) patch changing the message to always say "expects a valid network client type".  Even more helpful would be for that message to be followed by a list of valid, supported network types.

I think this has been fixed by this commit here:
https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=d139e9a6cf01b8c31f59
... so closing this ticket now.
