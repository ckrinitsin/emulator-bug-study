Qemu 4.0.0-rc3 COLO Primary Crashes with "Assertion `event_unhandled_count > 0' failed."

Hello Everyone,
Now with Qemu 4.0.0-rc3, COLO is finally working so I gave it a try, but the Primary is always crashing during Network use. Typing fast in ssh or running "top" with 0.1 second delay (change with 'd') reliably trigger the crash for me. I use the attached scripts to run Qemu, in my case both primary and secondary run on the same Host for testing purposes. See the files in the attached .tar.bz2 for more Info, they also contain a Coredump.

Regards,
Lukas Straub
