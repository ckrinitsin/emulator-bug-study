NVMe differences between QEMU v4.1.0 and v8.2.1
Description of problem:
We are currently upgrading QEMU from v4.1.0 to v8.2.1. In order to keep compatibility between the two QEMUs, we are adding ``-machine pc-q35-4.1``. One of our test is to ensure a guest that has hibernated on the previous QEMU is able to resume on the new one.

When resuming, we get the following error:

Digging throw the NVMe code, I have found one [patch](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-01/msg04202.html) changing the BAR layout. It doesn't look like there is a way to select the previous BAR layout.

When selecting the ``-machine``, I was expecting that the underlying HW (including devices) would not change. Can you clarify if hibernating from QEMU A and resuming to QEMU B is meant to be supported?
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start the guest with qemu v4.1.0 and an NVME disk
2. Hibernate the OS
3. Resume the guest with qemu v8.2.1
