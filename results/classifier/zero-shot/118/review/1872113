qemu docs fails to build with Sphinx 3.0.x

We've just updated Sphinx to version 3.0.1 and qemu fails to build the docs with this version.

Here's the relevant section in the build log.

Hmm, that's not ideal. The C is valid C which the compiler accepts, so I'm not sure what Sphinx is complaining about, and I don't have a system with that new a version of Sphinx.

It does suggest that we ought to make our configure --enable-werror/--disable-werror (and the code that makes the default be disable for releases) control Sphinx's warnings-as-errors option as well as the compiler's, which would at least mean that for released versions the build doesn't fail entirely on Sphinx warnings.


One of our packaging gurus make a small change that removed the error fails option.

# Don't treat warnings as errors when building docs with sphinx
sed -i -e '/SPHINX_BUILD/s/-W//' Makefile

The build completes now, however there are still errors.

build succeeded, 4 warnings.

The HTML pages are in docs/devel.

I'm a bit confused: you say "however there are still errors" but the build log you quote ends with "build succeeded, 4 warnings" and it looks like it has indeed just produced warnings and continued.


You are right. Wrong choice of words.

However, the change is a breaking change from Sphinx.

See https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/7457#issuecomment-612413080

I've sent a proposed fix to the list:
https://<email address hidden>/


The upstream fix for this is now in 5.0-rc3 and will be in the final 5.0 release.
