Build failure on s390x with Clang 17 due to int128 alignment used in `__sync_` operations
Description of problem:
We experienced this downstream, but filing this here since the code still seems to be the same in git.

https://reviews.llvm.org/D143813 introduced this warning since, according to the description, `__int128`
needs to be 8-byte aligned on s390 but the code in `host/include/generic/host/atomic128-ldst.h` unconditionally uses 16-byte alignment.

The output is:

```
