"Zoom to fit" doesn't work  with -display gtk -vga virtio

qemu version: 2.12.1

When using -display gtk for all -vga options (std,qxl,vmware,cirrus) the option "Zoom To Fit" is unchecked and auto-resizing of the window works well; except for -vga virtio: here "Zoom To Fit" is checked and auto-resizing doesn't work.

Proposal: disable "Zoom To Fit" as default for virtio as well

virtio-vga will adapt the guest display to the window size (once the guest drivers are loaded).
Therefore it is not needed to auto-resize the window (to avoid display scaling).

Well, then something isn't right here.

"Zoom to Fit" disabled: qemu starts with a small window (1:1 scale) and resizes the window when the xserver/window manager starts (1:1 scale). This is the sane and wanted behavior.

"Zoom to Fit" enabled: qemu starts with a small window and doesn't resizes the window when the xserver/window manager starts. The whole display is squeezed into the small window. The window simply ignores resolution changes of the guest.

So either there is sth wrong with your statement: "Therefore it is not needed to auto-resize the window" or with my setup (my window manager is dwm, the linux guest uses modesetting as video driver). 
 




The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
