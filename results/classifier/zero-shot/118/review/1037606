vmwgfx does not work with kvm vmware vga

vmwgfx driver fails to initialize inside kvm.

tried: kvm -m 2048 -vga vmware -cdrom RebeccaBlackLinux.iso (Ubuntu based, any Ubuntu live CD would do)

Would it be possible for you to test the latest upstream kernel?  Refer to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelMainlineBuilds . Please test the latest v3.6 kernel[0] (Not a kernel in the daily directory) and install both the linux-image and linux-image-extra .deb packages.

Once you've tested the upstream kernel, please remove the 'needs-upstream-testing' tag.  Please only remove that one tag and leave the other tags. This can be done by clicking on the yellow pencil icon next to the tag located at the bottom of the bug description and deleting the 'needs-upstream-testing' text. 

If this bug is fixed in the mainline kernel, please add the following tag 'kernel-fixed-upstream'.

If the mainline kernel does not fix this bug, please add the tag: 'kernel-bug-exists-upstream'.

If you are unable to test the mainline kernel, for example it will not boot, please add the tag: 'kernel-unable-to-test-upstream'.  
Once testing of the upstream kernel is complete, please mark this bug as "Confirmed".


Thanks in advance.

This issue appears to be an upstream bug, since you tested the latest upstream kernel.  Would it be possible for you to open an upstream bug report[0]?  That will allow the upstream Developers to examine the issue, and may provide a quicker resolution to the bug.

If you are comfortable with opening a bug upstream, It would be great if you can report back the upstream bug number in this bug report.  That will allow us to link this bug to the upstream report.

i am also having this problem on amd64 debian sid, using:

    qemu                            1.7.0+dfsg-5

on the guest system, i'm also running sid:

    linux-image-amd64               3.13+56
    xserver-xorg-video-vmware       1:13.0.1-3+b1

i added vmwgfx to /etc/modules, trying to follow the directions here (aside from using VMware Play, etc.):

    http://www.x.org/wiki/vmware/vmware3D/

however, that only gives me the bug sooner than Michael.

the bug on the kernel bug tracker is marked as "resolved obsolete", not "confirmed".

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46711 is marked as WILLNOTFIX, so I'm closing the QEMU bug here, too.

The kernel bugzilla response is:

The vmwgfx kernel module does not support devices without the pitchlock capability. Sorry. In that case you need to use the xf86-video-vmware driver standalone without kernel modesetting.

So presumably this is some capability to be added to the qemu device

Also http://airlied.livejournal.com/69291.html

OK, got your point ... but AFAIK the vmware display device in QEMU is pretty much unmaintened anyway, so unless someone steps up and takes care of this device, I think the WONT-FIX status is appropriate for this bug.
