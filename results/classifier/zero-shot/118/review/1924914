Running sway in a QEMU VM results in a GPU hang of the guest (virtio-gpu driver)

System is Arch Linux (guest and host OS).

Problem:

Basically, when using sway on a guest and running certain applications via Xwayland (on the guest), the GUI will freeze and won't be usable anymore, I can still ssh to the guest and run commands.

This is the command I use to run my guest:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cdrom ~/Downloads/linux/archlinux/archlinux-2021.04.01-x86_64.iso -m 4G -vga virtio -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22

This doesn't happen when I use X with i3-wm.



I can't get it to happen with -vga qxl.

I can't reproduce it with weston.

-cpu host -smp 4 makes the hang/freeze go away.

From the dmesg above:

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
