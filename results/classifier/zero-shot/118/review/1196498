Failed to create COM port in Windows Guest VM

Hi,

Tried to establish virtual serial connection between two Windows Guest VMs(Windows 2008 Server).

As it mentioned under the link,
http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/WindowsGuestDrivers/UpdatedGuestDebugging

Started VM using the below command with serial device as TCP port.
# qemu-system-x86_64 -smp 1 -enable-kvm -m 512 -boot c -serial tcp:127.0.0.1:50001,server,nowait -hda /mnt/sda5/var/lib/libvirt/images/win2008host.img

And started WinDbg in the Windows VM, with serial port:COM1 and Baudrate:115200.

It throws the error "Could not start kernel debugging using com:port:COM1,baudrate:115200 parameters, Win32 error 0n2. The system cannot find the file specified."

Checked under Device Manager and there is no COM1 port.
Does the -serial tcp:127.0.0.01:50001 creates COM1 port? I doubt.
If no what are the parameters I should pass to WinDbg for serial port?

Please help me how to solve this issue.

Thanks
Venkatesh

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
