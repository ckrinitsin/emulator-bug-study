qemu uses a bitmap icon

qemu currently uses the icon in pc-bios/qemu-icon.bmp, which, obviously, is a bitmap file. It is loaded such that white pixels will be transparent. This can cause nasty artifacts in the display.

Unless there is a specific reason to use bitmaps, I'd suggest moving to, e.g., a PNG file with a proper alpha channel.

For me the icon looks ugly if QEMU is run by the normal user. However, when run via sudo, it looks normal for some reason and does not display any of the white pixels.

I also see an ugly icon when running QEMU as a user in GNOME. I tried running QEMU as root to see if there is any difference, but it doesn't work at all. I think QEMU should use pc-bios/qemu_logo_no_text.svg instead of pc-bios/qemu-icon.bmp.

Gees, some please fix this already! Ubuntu 16.04.2 also uses some ugly icon.  Why not ditch the bitmaps and use this official svg?

On Ubuntu 18.04 and this is still an issue.

Please don't make QEMU look like a crappy piece of software. It deserves a crisp icon.

This series gives the QEMU SDL2 & GTK frontends high quality icons http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-12/msg04475.html


Finally fixed here:
