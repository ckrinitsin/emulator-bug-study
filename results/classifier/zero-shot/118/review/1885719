qemu/target/nios2/helper.c:261:20: style:inconclusive: Found duplicate branches for 'if' and 'else'

Source code is

            } else if (address >= 0x80000000) {
                /* Kernel virtual page */
                return cpu_nios2_handle_virtual_page(cs, address, rw, mmu_idx);
            } else {
                /* User virtual page */
                return cpu_nios2_handle_virtual_page(cs, address, rw, mmu_idx);
            }

Which version of QEMU did you use here? Apparently it was an older version, since that code has been removed more than a year ago already:

 https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=0137c93ff8cbcebf

Please make sure to use the latest release of QEMU when reporting bugs. Thanks!

>Which version of QEMU did you use here?

git trunk. I have no idea why Richard's patch isn't in my current version
and I am disinclined to find out why.

Any further work by me on qemu looks somewhat doubtful. Have fun !
