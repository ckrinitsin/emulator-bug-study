Incorrect VGA text mode rendering
Description of problem:
All of my physical machines use black as `DarkGray` and have the text starting from `White+DarkGray` blink (watch the video below). The ISO I'm using is a minimal kernel I've written to check VGA text mode (provided by the BIOS at `0xb8000` with a 80x25 resolution) handling on multiple emulators and machines.
Changing the emulated CPU and display driver doesn't change this behaviour.

Hyper-V: color test shows correct colors, all text starting from `White+DarkGray` is blinking

AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ + NVIDIA Quadro 400 on actual hardware: same as Hyper-V
I've tested this with multiple physical GPUs and they all have the same behaviour and color palette.

QEMU: dark gray is the wrong color and the text doesn't blink
Changing the emulated device doesn't change this behaviour.

I think QEMU should emulate the hardware as close as possible and therefore atleast have the blinking text.
Consider this a low priority issue.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download ISO from the link above
2. Run the QEMU command above
3. See the text not blink
