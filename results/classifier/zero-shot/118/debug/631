QEMU locks out user interface after waking from laptop sleep
Description of problem:
If qemu is started on laptop from command line and set to full screen, screen activated with mouse click, then put to sleep by closing lid; after waking up by opening lid the user interface locks out, the mouse cursor doesn't show, mouse clicks and keys are unresponsive.

A Ctrl-ALt-Fn terminal must then be used to locate and kill the qemu process. After which the system can recover if it is terminated. The system tends to be affected in other ways such as wifi being disabled and needs to manually enabled after. So it looks like it disrupts the system from fully restoring the awoken state.

The terminal from which QEMU is running is also filled with debug output. The issue looks to be caused by the SDL backend not knowing what to do with a wake up code. The terminal window is filled with the following text: 
`The key you just pressed is not recognized by SDL. To help get this fixed, please report this to the SDL forums/mailing list <https://discourse.libsdl.org/> X11 KeyCode 151 (143), X11 KeySym 0x1008FF2B (XF86WakeUp).`

I have reduced the steps causing the bug to as little as needed with low dependencies.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Using a laptop, start a qemu session in full screen like so:
  `./qemu-system-ppc -machine mac99,via=pmu -serial stdio -full-screen`
2. Shut the lid so it sleeps.
3. Shortly after open the lid.
Additional information:
I downloaded the 6.1.0 stable build and compiled it myself.

The SDL issue appears to be low priority. I found some reports here but see no evidence of it being discussed.
