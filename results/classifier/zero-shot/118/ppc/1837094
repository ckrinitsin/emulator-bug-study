I only had access to the last packet which isn't the culprit, I'm now seeing how to log the network traffic of the guest to provide more useful information.

Recent libslirp patch 126c04ac (explained in e0be8043) changed ip_reass(), so this bug might be fixed.

And

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/slirp/libslirp/commit/d203c81b

I apologize for not understanding this bug was a security issue, and not insisting on it.

It has been fixed in SLiRP by "Fix use-afte-free in ip_reass() (CVE-2020-1983)":
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/slirp/libslirp/commit/9bd6c591

And in QEMU by commit 7769c23774 "slirp: update to fix CVE-2020-1983".

Fixed in QEMU release v5.0.0
