qemu-user fails to run wineserver on ppc64el host

When attempting to run wineserver on a 64-bit ppc64el host via QEMU's user-mode i386 emulation, a file locking operation fails.

Command line:
qemu-i386-static /usr/lib/wine-development/wineserver32

Output:
wineserver: fcntl /tmp/.wine-0/server-17-14d21bf/lock: Invalid argument

Relevant portion of strace:
fcntl(6, F_SETLK64, 0x3fffe8802218) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
