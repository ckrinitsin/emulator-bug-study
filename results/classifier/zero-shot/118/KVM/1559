7.2 (regression?): ppc64 KVM-HV hangs during boot
Description of problem:
qemu 7.2.0 hangs at " * Mounting ZFS filesystem(s)  ..." whereas 7.1.0 would fully boot.

Without -smp, sometimes gets further and hangs later on at " * Seeding random number generator ..."
Additional information:
7.1.0 used to work before upgrading to 7.2.0, but would hang randomly after booting (usually during my benchmark). Not sure if related. Unfortunately, after downgrading back to 7.1.0, it also now hangs the same way as 7.2.0 does.
