Qemu / KVM always wants to be on top

Whenever I pass with the mouse over the KVM (qemu) window, it automatically raises on top, obscuring other windows on the same desktop, which is rather intrusive...
No other application does this.

> dpkg -l qemu-kvm

Seems like you are using the QEMU from your Linux distribution. If you want to have support for that version, you should use the bug tracker from your distro instead. Otherwise, can you please try again with the latest version from http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Download to see whether the bug is already fixed there? Thanks!

Seems to be fixed by now. Indeed kvm no longer does this on none of the 2 distributions that I currently use (Debian 8.6.0 and Kubuntu 14.04.5)

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
