SGX Device mapping is not listed into QEMU KVM
Description of problem:
I want to run SGX into QEMU VM, the vm is up and running but SGX device mappings are not listed there. I also looked in dmesg | grep sgx and it returned "There are zero epc section"

I have upgraded the libvirt to 8.6.0 because of below issue
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libvirt/+bug/1982896

I tried with libvirt-8.0.0 but it did not help

I have attached the xml, please let me know why sgx mappings are not showing inside VM
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Ubuntu 20.04 VM with SGX mapping
Additional information:
Please let me know if any other logs are required
