QEMU 5.1 no longer says anything about inaccessible devices

Previously, with QEMU 5.0.0 running a VM with the following command:

$ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -hda arch-zoom.qcow2 -m 4G -device usb-ehci,id=ehci -device usb-host,bus=ehci.0,vendorid=0x04f2,productid=0xb449 -device intel-hda -device hda-duplex -vga virtio

Would display something like the following:

libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] libusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/004: Permission denied
libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] libusb requires write access to USB device nodes.
libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] libusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/004: Permission denied
libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] libusb requires write access to USB device nodes.

With insufficient permissions.

QEMU 5.1.0 no longer displays anything.

I did a git bisect and this is the result:

[diego@thinkpad qemu]$ git bisect bad

    usb: add hostdevice property to usb-host

    The new property allows to specify usb host device name.  Uses standard
    qemu_open(), so both file system path (/dev/bus/usb/$bus/$dev on linux)
    and file descriptor passing can be used.

    Requires libusb 1.0.23 or newer.  The hostdevice property is only
    present in case qemu is compiled against a new enough library version,
    so the presence of the property can be used for feature detection.

The previous commit is fine, it displays the USB errors:

libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] libusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/004: Permission denied
libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] libusb requires write access to USB device nodes.
libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] libusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/004: Permission denied
libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] libusb requires write access to USB device nodes.


My system is Arch Linux.

Not sure this is a bug.

I was changing the /dev file permissions based on the output from above, that's why I decided to submit this bug report.

Either way, the output from lsusb works too.

I no longer need this (it's no longer an issue for me), feel free to reopen if this issue affects you.
