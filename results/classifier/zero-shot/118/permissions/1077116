automoc4 segfaults when building in an armhf pbuilder on an amd64 host

When trying to build kde4libs in an armhf pbuilder created with the pbuilder-scripts running on an amd64 host automoc4 recieves a segmentation fault and I can't get any useful information out of it:

automoc4 runs fine when building on a nexus7 so this sounds like an issue in qemu.
Tested in quantal and raring.

This still applies to raring's qemu with the linaro patches.

Thanks for reporting this bug.  There seem to be a few bugs in the armhf qemu-user-static right now.  I'll test against bleeding edge upstream.

Buildlog from an armfh PPA build as reference.

Same for me

I was able to reproduce this failure with QEMU 2.5, and the code runs OK under QEMU current master, so I think this is fixed by the threading/signal handling bugfixes we've done between then and now. I'm going to close this as will-be-fixed-in-2.11 (though it's quite possible it's already fixed in 2.10).


We have had a few more issues around armhf qemu-static that mostly resolved in Artful (qemu 2.10) and finally one that was good in Bionic (qemu 2.11).
This also included some updates to other components but should be good now.

If the issue here really still applies to a newer version please reopen and state an updated test and version that it ran on.
