qemu-system-sparc w/ SS-20 ROM does not add processors

When booting a SPARCstation-20 with the original ROM, qemu does not set the number of processors in a way that this ROM can understand it, and the ROM always reports only 1 processor installed:


 ~/qemu  /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-sparc -bios ./ss20_v2.25_rom -M SS-20 -cpu "TI SuperSparc 60" -smp 2 -nographic

(It is necessary use SS-20 since it is the only sun4m model that supports 512MB RAM, and I can't get Solaris to install on the SS-20 using OpenBIOS.) 

When booting with OpenBIOS I can't seem to boot any version of Solaris though I had heard this did work.  Solaris 8 and 9 do work nicely with this ROM, but I am opening this to see if it is possible to fix this to allow the original OBP ROM to see multiple processors.

As of QEMU 4 OpenBIOS can boot Solaris again, and it does properly allocate multiple CPUs. Of course, it's a whole lot slower on multiple CPUs which I wasn't really anticipating, but it does work.  (And single CPU is so fast anyway compared to the actual hardware it's emulating!)  So this bug while still applicable can be closed. 

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Yes this can be closed, no problems now using open bios to boot Solaris and it does support multiple processors though this is actually slower than one.
