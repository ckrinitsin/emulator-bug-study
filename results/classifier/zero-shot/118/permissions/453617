kvm hangs at 100% cpu when connecting to forwarded ports (when listed incorrectly on the command line)

Binary package hint: qemu-kvm

If kvm is started using two separate "-net user,hostfwd=<forwarding rule>" arguments to forward ports from the host to the client, it won't complain, but will return a connection refused error and hang at 100% cpu when trying to connect to either forwarded port.

However, if kvm is started with the hostfwd rules combined together into a single "-net user" argument, it works fine.

As an example, this command line doesn't generate any warnings or errors, but causes kvm to hang for me:

kvm -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:8888-:80 -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22 -m 128 -smp 1 -drive file=disk0.qcow2

... but this command line works fine:

kvm -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:8888-:80,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22 -m 128 -smp 1 -drive file=disk0.qcow2

On Lucid alpha 3 an error is reported and kvm stops:

$ sudo kvm -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:8888-:80 -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22 -m 128 -smp 1 -drive file=disk0.qcow2kvm -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:8888-:80 -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22 -m 128 -smp 1 -drive file=lucid.qcow2 
could not set up host forwarding rule 'tcp:127.0.0.1:8888-:80'

qemu-kvm Version: 0.12.3-0ubuntu2


Torsten-

Check your command line.  Looks like you double-pasted the faulty command.

Jesse-

I can actually confirm this in Lucid's qemu-kvm 0.12.3.  I ran your exact two lines and it seems to lock my kvm process and eat a bunch of cpu.

The symptoms look very similar to Bug #474968.

Anthony, can we have a look at this?

At the very least, the manpage needs to be updated, as the "hostfwd=[tcp|udp]:[hostaddr]:hostport-[guestaddr]:guestport" section says: "This option can be given multiple times."

The documentation aspect of this bug should be fix along with Bug #474969.

This bug was fixed in the package qemu-kvm - 0.12.3-0ubuntu6

Is there still an issue left here with upstream QEMU?

There hasn't been any comment about upstream QEMU within the last months, so I assume this has been fixed there, too. Closing...
