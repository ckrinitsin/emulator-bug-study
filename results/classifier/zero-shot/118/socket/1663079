socket network not working

The socket network type is no longer working in 2.8.0.

When trying to establish a network between 2 qemu instances:

The listening host:
qemu-system-x86_64 -netdev socket,id=in0,listen=127.0.0.1:9999 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=in0

works fine, but for the second one:

qemu-system-x86_64 -netdev socket,id=in0,connect=127.0.0.1:9999 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=in0

It fails with:

qemu-system-x86_64: -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=in0: Property 'virtio-net-device.netdev' can't find value 'in0'

netstat shows a new connection to port 9999 in time_wait state every time.

host: kernel 4.4.38, 64bits.

It was working fine with previous version.

Works for me with the current QEMU master branch... can you still reproduce the issue with the latest version of QEMU (either v4.2 or the master branch)?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
