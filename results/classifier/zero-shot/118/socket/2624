qemu-system-aarch64: tpm-emulator: TPM result for CMD_INIT: 0x9 operation failed
Description of problem:
I'm using QEMU (compile from the latest source code) to simulate a tpm2 device with the above command, it just returns an error message:
```
qemu-system-aarch64: tpm-emulator: TPM result for CMD_INIT: 0x9 operation failed
```
swtpm start command:
```
TPMSOCK=/tmp/swtpm-sock$$                                                                                                                                                  
swtpm socket --tpm2 -t -d --tpmstate dir=$PWD/tpm --ctrl type=unixio,path=$TPMSOCK --log level=20                                                                          
```
swtpm version:
```
TPM emulator version 0.7.3, Copyright (c) 2014-2021 IBM Corp.
```
Also tried the latest swtpm, encountered the same error.

swtpm log (0.7.3):
```
swtpm: Data client disconnected
swtpm: SWTPM_NVRAM_Lock_Dir: Could not open lockfile: Permission denied
swtpm: Error: Could not initialize libtpms.
swtpm: Error: Could not initialize the TPM
swtpm: Data client disconnected
```

swtpm log (0.10.0):
```
swtpm: SWTPM_NVRAM_StoreData: Error (fatal) opening tpm/TMP2-00.permall for write failed, Permission denied
swtpm: SWTPM_NVRAM_Lock_Dir: Could not open lockfile: Permission denied
swtpm: Error: Could not initialize the TPM
swtpm: Data client disconnected
```

Any clues about this error? Best regrads.
