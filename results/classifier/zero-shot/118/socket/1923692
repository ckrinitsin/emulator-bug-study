qemu 5.2.0: Add reconnect option support for netdev socket

Most of qemu socket accepting options (such as chardev) accept among other things a "reconnect" option.

netdev socket however returns: Invalid parameter 'reconnect'

It would make sense that available options for socket links be at least partially normalized (also see issue https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1903470 which was closed without resolution).


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
