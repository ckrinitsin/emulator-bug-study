qemu-1.5.0 savevm error -95 while writing vm with ceph-rbd as storage-backend

With a running VM I encounter this strange behaviour, former qemu-versions don't show up such an error.
Perhaps this comes from the rbd-backend in qemu-1.5.0 in combination with ceph-0.56.6?

( -95 might be a general "Operation not supported" error? )

Up to 1.4.2 everything is OK with savevm, though.

Any help welcome, 

Oliver.

Sorry for not providing enough informations, here we go:

typical longish start for qemu is:

/usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -usbdevice tablet -enable-kvm -daemonize -pidfile /var/run/qemu-server/760.pid -monitor unix:/var/run/qemu-server/760.mon,server,nowait -vnc unix:/var/run/qemu-server/760.vnc,password -qmp unix:/var/run/qemu-server/760.qmp,server,nowait -nodefaults -serial none -parallel none -device rtl8139,mac=00:F1:70:00:2F:80,netdev=vlan0d0 -netdev type=tap,id=vlan0d0,ifname=tap760i0d0,script=/etc/fcms/add_if.sh,downscript=/etc/fcms/downscript.sh -name 1155823384-4 -m 512 -vga cirrus -k de -smp sockets=1,cores=1 -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=virtio0 -drive format=raw,file=rbd:1155823384/vm-760-disk-1.rbd:rbd_cache=false,cache=writeback,if=none,id=virtio0,media=disk,index=0 -drive format=raw,file=rbd:1155823384/vm-760-swap-1.rbd:rbd_cache=false,cache=writeback,if=virtio,media=disk,index=1 -drive if=ide,media=cdrom,id=ide1-cd0,readonly=on -drive if=ide,media=cdrom,id=ide1-cd1,readonly=on -boot order=dc

after fired up I go to the monitor socket and try a:

QEMU 1.5.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) savevm test123
Error -95 while writing VM
(qemu) 

If I only let the error -95 happen and ignore, everything seems to be OK, though. Might be easy to fix, but not for me...
qemu up to 1.4.2 is not affected.

Please let me know, if you need more informations.

Oliver.



Triaging old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU (currently v2.9.0)?

Hi Thomas,

thnx for coming back on this. Currently on vacation, but just gave it a shot on fresh compiled qemu-2.9.0:

—

savevm
Error while writing VM state: Operation not supported

—

I think there once existed a patch from the Proxmox guys dealing with the VM state informations. But
apparently did not make it into main-stream.

Kind regards,

Oliver.
