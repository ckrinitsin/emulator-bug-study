qemu-img bug with dynamic vhd

Hye, i found a problem with qemu-img when trying to get info of a dynamic vhd. I made imgae of my 60GB computer hard drive with disk2vhd. The dynamic vhd is 21gb size.

With 1.0-rc3 version :
running command: qemu-img info 60_GB.VHD
qemu-img:  Could not open '60_GB.VHD' : File too large

0.14.1 version give me wrong information :
image: 60_GB.VHD
file format: vpc
virtual size: 127G (136899993600 bytes)
disk size: 21G

Thanks for reply.

Which host OS are you running qemu-img on?  Is it 32- or 64-bit?

I wonder if you get the same behavior when using qemu-img convert
instead of "disk2vhd" to create a vhd file.

Hi, 

I'm having the same problem. I'm using qemu-img 1.0, running from a Ubuntu Server 12.04 x64 on a SW RAID, ext4.

The .VHD has 29GB and was made using disk2vhd.

Here is the command and the results:
sudo kvm-img convert -f vpc -O raw image.VHD image.img
[sudo] password for sysop: 
kvm-img: Could not open 'image.VHD': File too large
kvm-img: Could not open 'image.VHD'

Same error doing a simple qemu-img info image.vhd

Thanks for your help

Serge Hallyn introduced the size check when VHD files are opened, you
can read about the background here:
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/106736/

I'm not sure if QEMU has a bug or lacks support for the file format
version used by disk2vhd.

Though that commit and the comments were about 127G images.  HIs is only 27G.

Also, 'qemu-img info' is also showing the error, which shows that this is not being done on vpc_create().

So I think this is a case of qemu-img actually failing to properly parse the FHD file.

The 127 GB limit applies to the virtual disk size, not to the size of
the image file itself.

I'm not sure what you mean.  Your commit (efc8243d00) added an -EFBIG
return to vcp_open(), not vpc_create().  This will affect qemu-img
info.

We need the header/footer contents to be sure what's going on here.

Please post the output of the following commands:

$ hexdump -C -n 512 image.VHD
$ hexdump -C -n 512 -s $(($(ls -l image.VHD | awk '{ print $5 }') -
512)) image.VHD

This will show the file header/footer, which contains fields that are
validated when opening the file.

Thanks,
Stefan

I thought he had converted a roughly 26GB physical disk, assumed (perhaps
wrongly) that was the virtual disk size.

Oops, good point.  Thanks.

qemu-img fails to read a disk2vhd (VHD)  image created from  a Windows Server 2003.   
qemu-img will read and convert a VDI image created from that VHD

VHD header/footer details:


[root@T3400 ]# qemu-img info vhd/p.vhd
qemu-img: Could not open 'vhd/p.vhd': File too large

[root@T3400 ]# ./vhddump -vv -s vhd/p.vhd

Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU (currently version 2.9.0)?

No, sorry. The environment was retired in 2014 and we took a different direction.
