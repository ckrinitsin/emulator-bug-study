CDROM size not updated when changing image files

I'm using qemu 13.0 with a plain Linux kernel using the ata_piix driver as the guest, and an initrd that starts a shell. When changing the image in the monitor and reading from the CDROM in the guest, the size is not updated. I'm using LInux 2.6.32.24
as the host and I've tested 2.6.32.24, 2.6.35, and 2.6.36 as guests.  Both host and guest are 64-bit. Here is the command used to start the guest using the initrd:

./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom /spare2/cd1.img -kernel /sources/linux-2.6.32.24-test/arch/x86/boot/bzImage -initrd /spare2/initrd.img -append 'root=/dev/ram0 rw' -cpu core2duo

Additional info on this bug can be found here: http://marc.info/?l=kvm&m=128746013906820&w=2. Note: this is how I discovered 
the bug, using 32-bit Slackware install CDs.

I'm attaching the initrd I used in my tests: I created two different-sized fake CDROM images by dd'ing from /dev/zero. In my tests,
cd1.img is smaller that cd2.img. In the monitor I executed 'change ide1-cd0 /spare2/cd2.img' to load the new image. I checked 
the size by cat'ing /sys/block/sr0/size in the guest after reading the CDROM. Reading the CDROM was done by typing
'dd if=/dev/sr0 of=/dev/null bs=512 count=3'



Please note that until this bug is fixed, one cannot successfully install a guest OS from a set of CD-ROMS where the first disk image is smaller than subsequent ones.

Just to clarify, the contents of the image do change, but the reported size does not?

Sounds like a missing change event to the guest to me.

Kevin, are you aware of this bug?

I looks like change event is being sent, but it's being eaten by the
error recovery in the guest.


      

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
