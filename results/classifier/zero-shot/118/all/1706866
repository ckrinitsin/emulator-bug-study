migrate:  add tls option in virsh, migrate failed

version:
    libvirt-3.4.0 + qemu-2.9.90(latest)

domain:
    any

step:
    1. generate tls certificate in /etc/pki/libvirt-migrate
    2. start vm
    3. migrate vm, cmdline:
       virsh migrate rh7.1-3 --live --undefinesource --persistent --verbose --tls qemu+ssh://IP/system
    4. then migrate failed and reported:
 Migration: [ 64 %]error: internal error: qemu unexpectedly closed the monitor: Domain pid=5288, libvirtd pid=49634

This is the qemu bug tracker here. Please report libvirt bugs to the libvirt project instead (see http://libvirt.org/bugs.html). Thanks!

with libvirt test, qemu report error, this is problem for qemuï¼Œso report here!

But then please follow this recommendation from http://www.qemu.org/contribute/report-a-bug/ :

"Reproduce the problem directly with a QEMU command-line. Avoid frontends and management stacks, to ensure that the bug is in QEMU itself and not in a frontend."

So can you reproduce the problem by starting QEMU directly from the command line?

ok, thank you!

chan: The backtrace you show there - how did you capture that? Was that from a core dump  ?  If so then please do a   bt full  to get more detail.

Even if you can't reproduce it with qemu without libvirt I'd be interested to debug it - but the libvirt logs from /var/log/libvirt/qemu/.... on both the source and the destination would help.
