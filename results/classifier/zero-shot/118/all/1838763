Bugs in SSH module (ssh.c)

I installed gcc-8&libssh* on my Ubuntu 18.04 arm64.When I was compiling any version of qemu like 3.1.0 4.0.0or 4.1.0 with SSH support,the GCC went wrong.It said some vars undeclared like'SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_OTHER','SSH_KNOWN_HOST_UNKNOWN',etc.

As suggested by Richard in [*], filled a libssh report:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libssh/+bug/1847514

[*] https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-08/msg02506.html

I think that libssh in Ubuntu 18.04 is just broken. I don't think that we'll include a work-around in QEMU for this anymore, now that 20.04 is already released and works fine. Thus closing this as WONTFIX.
