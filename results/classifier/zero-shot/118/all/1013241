qemu-system-ppc64 hanging occasionally in disk writes

I found last week that qemu-system-ppc64 (from git) hangs occasionally          
under load, and I have a reproducer for it now.  Unfortunately the              
reproducer really takes a long time to run -- usually I can get a hang          
in under 12 hours.                                                              
                                                                                
Here is the reproducer case:                                                    
                                                                                
  https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/ppc/2012-June/001698.html           
                                                                                
Notes:                                                                          
                                                                                
(1) Verified by one other person (other than me).  Happens on both              
    ppc64 and x86-64 host.                                                      
                                                                                
(2) Happens with both Fedora guest kernel 3.3.4-5.fc17.ppc64 and kernel         
    3.5.0 that I compiled myself.  The test case above contains 3.3.4-5.        
                                                                                
(3) Seems to be a problem in qemu, not the guest.  The reason I think           
    this is because I tried to capture a backtrace of the hang using            
    remote gdb, but gdb just hung when trying to connect to qemu                
    (gdb connects fine before the bug happens).                                 
                                                                                
(4) Judging by guest messages, appears to be happening when writing             
    to the disk.

I switched to using virtio-scsi (instead of virtio-blk).  This appears to have solved
this problem, although it brings another problem.  I also tried vscsi, which fixes
both problems.

Therefore I will (not definitively) claim that the problem lies somewhere in virtio-blk,
but a workaround seems to be available.

What was the virtio-scsi problem ? (Other than SLOF doesn't know about
it yet :-) I haven't audited/tested it so it might have endian issues...

I have reproduced a similar hang with vscsi in full emulation, I haven't
observed your problem with virtio-blk, I plan to spend more time doing
some torture testing & debugging this week see if I can find out what's
going on.

BTW. What was your guest kernel version ?

Cheers,
Ben.




The problem with virtio-scsi is only a single disk shows up:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1013691

I've been using guest kernels 3.3.4 and 3.5.0-rc2+ (ie. Linus git), and both behave the same way.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
