Bug checklist for AEHD
Description of problem:
There was a discussion on qemu-devel about addition of a new hypervisor, which is essentially a rewrite of linux/kvm, but for windows
- 202303002 Haito Shan [PATCH 0/6] Adding the Android Emulator hypervisor driver accelerator  
  https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/CAGD3tSzW1QoAsn+uGjoAkBegLt1iZ=9YWDFcvqbcHMr0S_5kVw@mail.gmail.com/

If the new hypervisor AEHD does not support these, then each of the below may automatically qualify as a feature catchup bug
1) Nested Virtualization
2) virtio-GPU/virgl/OpenGL/venus
3) Vulkan passthrough
4) Xen emulation on KVM ( a feature also currently under development)   
  20230302 [phase1-qemu-8.0](https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20230302123029.153265-1-pbonzini@redhat.com/) [PULL 00/62] i386, misc changes for QEMU 8.0 soft freeze  
  20230307 [phase2-qemu-8.0](https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20230307171750.2293175-1-dwmw2@infradead.org/) [PATCH v2 00/27] Enable PV backends with Xen/KVM emulation  
5) Migration 
6) others??

perhaps also document if known for certain that there is no intention to catchup to a particular feature.
Steps to reproduce:
NA
