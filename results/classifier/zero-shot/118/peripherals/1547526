Java program does not execute on SPARC Solaris 8

Hello, 

I am trying to run a java program that never execute. The program uses jre1.1.5 which came with the java program. I don't know what to do to run this application. There are some random messages in command line that can be related to my problem (or not). They are:

	#1. Webstart launcher crashing.
	Also found here: http://www.openfirmware.info/pipermail/openbios/2011-May/006472.html

	#2. Assertion failed: MUTEX_HELD(&svc_mutex), file rpc/svc_run.c, line 766
	Which was already reported here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1450881

	#3. Some problems with libthread in Solaris. 
	I have tried a workaround setting LM_LIBRARY_PATH to use another version of libthread that Solaris 8 has.

I don't know if this is a qemu problem or Solaris problem.
My java application can be executed in command line or in GUI but I've tried both with no luck. I also have tryed other versions of JRE from 1.1.8 to 1.5 but no luck either.

I appreciate **any information** that can help me to execute the java program!!
Thank you.

I am using qemu-system-sparc (v2.5.50) with Solaris 8 (solaris-8-hw4-2.04-sparc).
The host is an Ubuntu 15.10 and I am using the openbios-sparc from Ubuntus ppa as shown bellow:

	openbios-sparc | 1.1+svn1334-1 | http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ wily/universe amd64 Packages

The command line used to launch qemu is:

	qemu-system-sparc \
		-M SS-5 \
		-m 256 \
		-boot c \
		-cdrom $(DATA_ISO) \
		-drive file=root-disk.img,index=0,media=disk,format=raw \
		-serial stdio \
		-monitor tcp::4444,server,nowait \
		-localtime \
		-net user \
		-net nic \
		$(ui)

DATA_ISO is the way I found to send my data to the guest.

The root-disk.img is:

	Disk root-disk.img: 36 GiB, 38654705664 bytes, 75497472 sectors
	Geometry: 27 heads, 107 sectors/track, 24620 cylinders
	Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
	Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
	I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
	Disklabel type: sun

	Device           Start      End  Sectors   Size Id Type       Flags
	root-disk.img1       0  2744549  2744550   1.3G  2 SunOS root

	root-disk.img3       0 71127179 71127180  33.9G  5 Whole disk      
	root-disk.img8 3047895 71127179 68079285  32.5G  8 SunOS home      

	image: root-disk.img
	file format: raw
	virtual size: 36G (38654705664 bytes)
	disk size: 1.2G

I've been looking at this as I have time, and IMO it's a qemu bug. Fortunately I have a easy local reproducer here, and from what I can see in this one particular case it seems the QEMU doesn't honour the annul bit in the branch (or apparently corrupts it according to the guest?!). So yes, it's a known issue and I am working hard to try and isolate the bug and come up with a fix.

Hi Mark, it is very good to hear that it isn't only with me.

Let me know if you need a help to test and/or collect any information to help you to discover/fix this problem.

Proposed patch posted to mailing list: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-04/msg01645.html - please test and report back.


Great Mark! This patch solves my problem. Thank you very much. 

Patch that solves the problem.

Leandro, thanks for testing on your setup. If it passes my local tests, I'll send it in for the QEMU 2.6 release.

Good! I tested with QEMU from git that I did the clone now. It shows
version 2.5.91.

Hi Mark, do you know when qemu 2.6 will be released?
