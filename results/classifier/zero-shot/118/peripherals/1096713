qemu 1.3.0: Windows XP crashes when reconizing the USB keyboard

I'm trying to use the usb tablet and the usb keyboard as follows:
./qemu-system-i386  -device pci-ohci -device usb-tablet -device usb-kbd
or
./qemu-system-i386  -device ich9-usb-ehci1 -device ich9-usb-uhci1 -device usb-tablet -device ich9-usb-uhci2 -device usb-kbd

While Windows XP works fine if I only use the tablet but not the keyboard, it crashed with a BSOD when I use both keyboard and tablet. It crashed during the detection of the keyboard.

Triaging old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU (currently version 2.9.0)?
