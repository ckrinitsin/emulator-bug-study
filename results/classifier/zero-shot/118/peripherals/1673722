Reading register at offset. It is not fully implemented warning make VM impossible to use

Hi,

Since this commit:
https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/bc0f0674f037a01f2ce0870ad6270a356a7a8347

We can no longer use the IOSvL2 image from Cisco. The problem is we got a lot of warning message saying:
e1000: Reading register at offset: 0x00002410. It is not fully implemented. 

User got so much of this warning that they can't use the VM. 

Thanks for the help

CCing the author and maintainers.

DBGOUT() is compiled in by default.  Warnings that can be triggered at a
high rate by the guest should be off by default or use a
printf_once()-style macro so they are only printed once and not again.

Leonid: do you want to adjust e1000 DBGOUT() usage to avoid printing
guest-triggerable messages by default?

If we want to report "whoops, we don't implement this yet" messages then
the recommended way to do that is
 qemu_log_mask(LOG_UNIMP, "....");

(these are not reported by default but only if the user asks for them.)

I don't see a reason that enabling E1000E_DEBUG by default. How about 
just disable it by default?

Thanks


I sent a patch to the mailing list:
