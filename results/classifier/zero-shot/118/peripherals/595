QEMU VNC mouse doesn't move in tablet mode os9
Description of problem:
What I am trying to do is have a headless os9 running in QEMU on ubuntu and use the native vnc support in QEMU to access the screen. That is setup and works as expected but the mouse only works in ps/2 mode and that is clearly very undesirable (mouse is never lined up). I set it up in tablet mode and when I am in the QEMU window on the host the mouse works perfect (I added tablet mode to os9 with: https://github.com/kanjitalk755/macos9-usb-tablet). That same tablet mode results in the mouse not moving at all over vnc, if I ctrl+alt 2 and switch the mouse type from tablet mode it starts working again but not lined up at all as expected, cant get to any buttons on edges. Is there anyone in here that ran into this? Am I the only one using QEMU VNC?

Iv thought about running a vnc application on the vm itself but performance was meh at best. Any tips would be worth a lot to me, its a sin to say but I am trying to adapt this into a production environment...

Upon further investigation this seems to be a issue on Linux. I am testing the QEMU on windows and its working as expected over VNC. That is to say if QEMU is running on a windows host, it just works over vnc with tablet mode. So what could be causing Linux version to not work? I did compile it from source, are there any configure flags I am missing? I am trying to run it on Ubuntu server 21.04
Steps to reproduce:
1.add vnc option to parameters
2.enable tablet mode and install driver in os9
3.connect to vnc and mouse doesn't move
