Qemu does not force SSE data alignment

I have an OS that tries to use SSE operations. It works fine in qemu. But it crashes when I try to run the OS at the host cpu using KVM.

The instruction that crahes with #GP(0) is
 movaps ADDR,%xmm0

The documentation says ADDR has to be 16-bytes alignment otherwise #GP is generated. And indeed the problem was with the data alignment. After adjusting it at my side the OS works fine both with Qemu and KVM.

It would be great if QEMU followed specification more closely and forced SSE data alignment requirements. It will help to catch alignment issues early and debug it easier.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

I am currently running into this bug on QEMU emulator version 5.1.0.
movaps unaligned access works fine in qemu, when it should throw a GP. Likewise, the same code on physical hardware throws a GP.

Yep.  Long-standing bug.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
