qemu-system-x86_64 minimizing window causes keyboard input lag globally

After qemu window is minimized, it causes keyboard lag on the host for all applications, pressed keys will be delayed and very laggy, typing to notepad or any other text extremely slowly appear on the screen, queue is slowly processed.
If qemu window is open back to normal size, keyboard is back to normal, everything is back to normal and stable, this behavior i have been testing since several months of qemu releases, i am reporting a bit late here, not breaking but it seems important and everytime i accidently minimize qemu, i remember it later and take qemu window to normal size back always, i try never minimize it anymore.
This problem does not occur if using -display none
Guest OS doesn't matter for this behavior, result is always same
I am using:
qemu 5.1.0.0
qemu-system-x86_64w.exe
Windows 10 build 2004
4K screen dpi scaling set to 150%

If requested, i can record a video to see the problem clearly, but i think all information i give already clear now.

Thanks for making quality software, hope all bugs fixed

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
