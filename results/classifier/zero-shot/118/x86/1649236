Commit snapshot fails with Permission denied when daemonized

When running qemu with daemonize option it is impossible to run "commit all" in monitor.

I run qemu 2.7.0 under gentoo 64 bit distribution with following command line:

qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -cpu host -smp 2 -enable-kvm -snapshot \
    -drive file=vm.img,if=virtio \
    -net nic,model=virtio,macaddr=11:11:11:11:11:11 \
    -net tap,ifname=tap$PORT,script=no,downscript=no \
    -vnc :1 -daemonize \
    -chardev vc,id=mon0 -mon chardev=mon0,mode=readline \
    -chardev socket,id=mon1,host=localhost,port=10001,server,nowait -mon chardev=mon1,mode=control 

I connect to vm through VNC viewer and press CTRL+ALT+2 and run "commit all" command.
Following error is shown:
`commit` error for `all`: Permission denied

When I run my VM without `daemonize` option the command "commit all" works without errors.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
