Cannot build QEMU on RHEL6 because of MAP_HUGETLB

Hello,
I've just downloaded qemu-2.11.0 sources and I wanted to build QEMU on RHEL6 x86_64, for various targets, amonst which arm-linux-user.

The build fails because /usr/include/bits/mman.h does not define MAP_HUGETLB.

I think it is needed since commit 541e16904.

I'm not sure if RHEL6 is still supported by QEMU? If so, can you fix this problem?

Thanks

I think we can close this bug: the build fails on RHEL6.4, but succeeded on RHEL6.7.

Probably related to: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/320613

This was fixed by the distro updating their glibc-headers pakcage:

* Tue Jul 23 2013 Alexandre Oliva <email address hidden> - 2.12-1.119
- Add MAP_HUGETLB and MAP_STACK support (#916986).
- Update translation for stale file handle error (#970776).

The build works in the current centos6 docker image and has been confirmed to build on later RHEL6 (RHEL6.7). 

OK, since we work on more recent RHEL6 and the submitter is happy with that, let's close this bug as WONTFIX.
