qemu-fixed-text-console.device not found error when using display set to anything but SDL
Description of problem:
When attempting to launch QEmu from the command line using any display option aside from `sdl`, QEmu fails to launch with this error message:

```plaintext
Unexpected error in object_property_find_err() at ../qom/object.c:1314:
qemu: Property 'qemu-fixed-text-console.device' not found
Aborted
```

This error is almost nonexistent when searching online. There is a mention of it in this chain of messages on the mailing list from about a week ago, but it doesn't seem to discuss any kind of way to remedy it. Link: https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg988630.html

I came across this issue because I was attempting to launch QEmu in other display modes, because for some reason if I launch with the `-display sdl` option, QEmu successfully starts up but then the display is black the majority of the time with some very brief flickers of the OS, and mouse/keyboard input don't seem to be correctly handled, making it unusable. So when trying to see if another display configuration could help me be able to resolve the black screen issue, I learned that I can't even launch with any other configuration due to the fixed text console not being found.

I have been using these simple arguments for running the configure script:

```plaintext
../configure --enable-debug --target-list=x86_64-softmmu
```

I tried using the configure flags `--enable-gtk` and `--enable-sdl` to see if they made any difference, but it seemed like they did not (neither the black screen issue or the fixed text console device error changed) so I just started leaving them off.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run configure script
2. Run make to build QEmu
3. Launch QEmu using `-display gtk` or with no `-display` option specified at all (also tried: `./qemu-system-x86_64 -m 6G -smp 2 -hda ../../vdisk1.qcow2`) and the error occurred.
4. Error occurs
Additional information:
I am new to QEmu and am trying to use it as part of a college project, so if anyone wants to respond, please let me know if I can give any additional information at all that could help.
