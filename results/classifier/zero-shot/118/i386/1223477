Unable to read USB filesystems with EFI Bios

Preamble and version:
With respect to my fix for using USB devices as -hda mentioned in bug 1223467
Using Qemu 1.6.0 with OVMF r11337-alpha (Qemu is built from Source, OVMF is pre built)

Command:
qemu-system-i386.exe -m 1024 -hda \\.\PhysicalDrive1 -L ovmf-ia32

Fault:
The EFI Shell is able to detect the hda block device, report its capacity and usage; 
but it sees no files or directories on the device.

Similar commands:
I have also seen the same with 
qemu-system-x86_64.exe -m 1024 -hda \\.\PhysicalDrive1 -L ovmf-ia32
and
qemu-system-x86_64.exe -m 1024 -hda \\.\PhysicalDrive1 -L ovmf-x64

Investigations:
I tried very small (500MB) and very large (32 GB) USB devices with no difference.
I re-built several versions of Qemu in an identical build environment, and found that: 
Qemu 1.2.2 and before, all the above commands work and the EFI boot loader is called.
Qemu 1.3.0-rc0 and after do not work and the USB device appears blank.
I'm reporting the bug here and not with OVMF because older versions of Qemu with the same OVMF bios work perfectly. 

In all cases using '-L pc-bios' works perfectly.
In all cases using an image of the USB device works.

Thanks

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
