e1000 - no link detected by VXWorks based guest

I'm trying to get a VXWorks image running inside a qemu guest.  I have the machine running, however, the vxworks image only has support for the 82544EI device so I had to change the device ID in e1000.c to get the device even recognized so I'm not sure if this is a bug or an issue for the development list.


After changing e1000.c, the device is now seen by the guest OS, however, it never gets a link.  I've attached the e1000 debug logs in the hopes that someone can help me understand where to start looking into why this guest won't get a link.

I tested the updated e1000 driver with a debian live CD and the card works under it, so it doesn't appear that the issue is with the driver string change but rather something in the e1000 driver itself.

Here is the command I'm using to start QEMU:

/opt/qemu/bin/qemu-system-i386  -cpu coreduo -hda /root/vxworks_test -m 2048 -netdev tap,ifname=tap0,id=net0 -netdev tap,ifname=tap1,id=net1 -device e1000,netdev=net0,mac=00:00:e8:01:02:03 -device e1000,netdev=net1,mac=00:00:e8:01:02:04 -boot c -curses -no-kvm -D /tmp/qemu.log 2>/tmp/e1000.log



Triaging old bug tickets... Which version of QEMU have you been using here? Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
