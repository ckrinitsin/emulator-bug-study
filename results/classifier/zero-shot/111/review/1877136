Qemu GDB Arm core registers XML description not valid for M-profile

When trying to debug an armv7-m binary running on Qemu, GDB makes some mistakes due to mistakenly believing the target is not M-profile.

One observable is that backtraces over signal handlers are not handled correctly -- since the special M-profile EXC_RETURN value is not recognised.  That happens because GDB doesn't think the target is M-profile.

This happens because GDB sees a reported feature set from the Qemu remote connection that includes the feature `org.gnu.gdb.arm.core`.

As described in the GDB online docs, for "M-profile targets (e.g. Cortex-M3), the ‘org.gnu.gdb.arm.core’ feature is replaced by ‘org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile’"
https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/ARM-Features.html

From a scan of the Qemu source code on commit ea1329bb3a8d5cd25b70e3dbf73e7ded4d5ad756 it seems that when emulating an arm core it uses `arm-core.xml` unconditionally for `CPUClass->gdb_core_xml_file`, and that means the only feature provided is `org.gnu.gdb.arm.core`.

Note that even though there is a command to set the architecture in GDB, setting the target architecture to an M-profile core is still not a valid workaround.
This is because the target description overrides everything in setting the `is_m` attribute within GDB.

Reproduction of the observable:
Using the examples here https://git.linaro.org/people/peter.maydell/m-profile-tests.git/tree/ .
Build the examples, and run 
```
qemu-system-arm -s -S -no-reboot -M lm3s6965evb -m 16 -serial stdio -display none -net nic -net user,restrict=on -d guest_errors,unimp -kernel test3-kern.bin
```

Then in a GDB session
```
vshcmd: > arm-none-eabi-gdb -q                                                                                                                                                                    
(gdb)
vshcmd: > file test3-kern.elf
