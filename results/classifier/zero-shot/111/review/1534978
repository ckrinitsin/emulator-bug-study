Windows command line -name cannot use = sign

Windows command line:

qemu.exe -L . -name "32-bit Emulation Session RAM=500MB" -boot c -m 500 -drive file=\\.\PhysicalDrive2

This fails to run.
If I remove the = sign in the -name quoted string it runs OK.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


Cannot reproduce in recent version - please close.

Thanks for checking! Closing now.
