qemu-system-riscv64 hangs after poweroff linux command

QEMU Version : v4.2.0-773-g43d1455-dirty (commit 43d1455cf84283466e5c22a217db5ef4b8197b14)

Command: qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -kernel ./bbl -nographic -initrd rootfs.cpio.gz -append "root=/dev/ram console=ttyS0"

Host:LSB Version:    :core-4.1-amd64:core-4.1-noarch
Distributor ID: CentOS
Description:    CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core)
Release:        7.7.1908
Codename:       Core


Problem: after boot, when type poweroff -f it hangs (not quitting). I have tested this for x86_64, and aarch64 and it works fine. The problem appears only for risv64(of those mentioned). Last time i have checked it worked also for riscv64 and it was on the d0f90e1423b4f412adc620eee93e8bfef8af4117 commit

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
