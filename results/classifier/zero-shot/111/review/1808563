Listing the contents of / lists QEMU_LD_PREFIX instead

Seeing this in qemu-user version 3.1.0

Demo:
$ QEMU_LD_PREFIX=$(pwd)/usr/armv7a-cros-linux-gnueabi ../run/qemu-arm /tmp/coreutils --coreutils-prog=ls / 
etc  lib  usr
$ ls /
boot  etc   lib     lib64   lost+found  mnt    root  sbin  sys  usr
bin   dev   export  home    lib32       net    proc  run   tmp  var
$ ls usr/armv7a-cros-linux-gnueabi
etc  lib  usr

In strace, the openat for "/" is remapped to the directory specified in QEMU_LD_PREFIX:
[pid  5302] openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/qemu/usr/armv7a-cros-linux-gnueabi", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_DIRECTORY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3

As an aside, if I change the code to do chdir("/"); opendir("."); it works fine.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

This might also be a duplicate of bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813307

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
