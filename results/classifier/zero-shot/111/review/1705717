Live migration fails with 'host' cpu when KVM is inserted with nested=1

Qemu v2.9.0
Linux kernel 4.9.34

Live migration(pre-copy) being done from one physical host to another:

Source Qemu:
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=${IMAGE_DIR}/${IMAGE_NAME},if=virtio -m 2048 -smp 1 -net nic,model=virtio,macaddr=${MAC} -net tap,ifname=qtap0,script=no,downscript=no -vnc :1 --enable-kvm -cpu kvm64 -qmp tcp:*:4242,server,nowait

And KVM is inserted with nested=1 on both source and destination machine.

Migration fails with a nested specific assertion failure on destination at target/i386/kvm.c +1629

Migration is successful in the following cases-

A) cpu model is 'host' and kvm is inserted without nested=1 parameter
B) If instead of 'host' cpu model, 'kvm64' is used (KVM nested=1)
C) If instead of 'host' cpu model, 'kvm64' is used (KVM nested=0)
D) Between an L0 and a guest Hypervisor L1, with 'kvm64' as CPU type (and nested=1 for L0 KVM)

Hi,
  Can you please give the exact assertion failure.

However, I'm confused - I think you're saying that your setup is that both hosts have nested enabled, but this is a migration of top level VM - correct?  Does the top level VM have a guest inside it - migration with a nested guest is known not to work, however migration of a VM on a host with nested enabled should work if the guest doesn't use the nest.


Hello,
I could not replicate this behavior on another system.
So, please close this bug.
Apologies for the inconvenience.

Hmm OK; but if you do hit it again please just reopen this one and give the full assert and details
