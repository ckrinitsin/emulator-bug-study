SDL UI switching to monitor half-broken and scrolling broken

ctrl+alt+2 must be pressed 2 or more times for the monitor console window to appear with -sdl, the window flashes and disappears also before finally staying open

backspace does not always work in -sdl also, and switching back and forth very quickly from the vga to the monitor windows, it hangs

you need to do a proper code review of all the user interfaces.

This is described a bit more here:

  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-05/msg00946.html

But basically it's a libsdl bug:

  https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3287

i see, but there are still problems with the user interfaces.

did you use SDL1.2 or SDL2 here?
