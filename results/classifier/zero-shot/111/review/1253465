This is a known issue.  VMware has not released the file format
specification for VMDK version 3.  At this point the information needed
to implement version 3 support is not publicly available.

If you are aware of open source software which already supports version
3, please let us know!

Fam: Do you have instructions for exporting version 2 images from
VMware?

VirtualBox can.

- VirtualBox uses VMDK version 3 disks.
- When you export a VM with VirtualBox (creating an .ova), it will include VMDK version 3 disks.
- VirtualBox can convert from vmkd to vdi. ('VBoxManage clonehd --format VDI "vmdk_file" "vdi_file"')

Does that help?

Can you try again with QEMU 2.8? Recent versions of QEMU should be able to
handle version 3 VMDK disks.
