Documentation for mtdblock, option-rom, and pflash is non-existent

The options -mtdblock, -option-rom, and -pflash are severely under-documented.  For example:

-mtdblock  -- It isn't at all clear what this does from --help or the documentation, and it's especially not clear that it's only implemented for ARM right now

-option-rom is only implemented for a handful of architectures, including palm, pc, pci, and one or two others

-pflash looks to be implemented for most if not all architectures, but there's nothing informing the user that it replaces the bios if -bios isn't used in tandem with -pflash, and it isn't clear whether the user could add multiple pflash roms


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
