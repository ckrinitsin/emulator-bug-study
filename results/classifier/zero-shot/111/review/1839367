Wrong interrupts generated for I.MX6 FEC controller

The imx_eth_update function in hw/net/imx_fec.c has the following comment (https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/864ab314f1d924129d06ac7b571f105a2b76a4b2/hw/net/imx_fec.c#L421-L445):

    /*
     * Previous versions of qemu had the ENET_INT_MAC and ENET_INT_MAC
     * interrupts swapped. This worked with older versions of Linux (4.14
     * and older) since Linux associated both interrupt lines with Ethernet
     * MAC interrupts. Specifically,
     * - Linux 4.15 and later have separate interrupt handlers for the MAC and
     *   timer interrupts. Those versions of Linux fail with versions of QEMU
     *   with swapped interrupt assignments.
     * - In linux 4.14, both interrupt lines were registered with the Ethernet
     *   MAC interrupt handler. As a result, all versions of qemu happen to
     *   work, though that is accidental.
     * - In Linux 4.9 and older, the timer interrupt was registered directly
     *   with the Ethernet MAC interrupt handler. The MAC interrupt was
     *   redirected to a GPIO interrupt to work around erratum ERR006687.
     *   This was implemented using the SOC's IOMUX block. In qemu, this GPIO
     *   interrupt never fired since IOMUX is currently not supported in qemu.
     *   Linux instead received MAC interrupts on the timer interrupt.
     *   As a result, qemu versions with the swapped interrupt assignment work,
     *   albeit accidentally, but qemu versions with the correct interrupt
     *   assignment fail.
     *
     * To ensure that all versions of Linux work, generate ENET_INT_MAC
     * interrrupts on both interrupt lines. This should be changed if and when
     * qemu supports IOMUX.

Unfortunately, this behavior causes the QNX Sabrelite BSP (http://blackberry.qnx.com/en/developers/bsp) to hang on ethernet initialization. This is caused by the fact that QEMU is firing the ENET_INT_TS_TIMER timer interrupt unexpectedly (when the ENET_INT_MAC flag is set). The BSP functions correctly on the actual hardware, but it is unable to handle the deliberately incorrect interrupt firing by QEMU.

From reading the comment, it appears that this behavior is necessary to support certain versions of Linux. However, it would be very useful to be able to restore the correct interrupt behavior (possibly via a command-line flag).

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


Still a bug.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
