Qemu-5.1.0 build from source man entry not found

Hello together,

i build qemu-5.1.0 from source on centos 8 withe the following command:

../configure --prefix=/usr --target-list=x86_64-softmmu,x86_64-linux-user

make -j4

make install

The build and the installation finished successfully. But when i try the command

man qemu-system-x86_64

i got the message "No manual entry found". What i do wrong ?

Best regards
Damian

You probably don't have the necessary dependencies to build the manual pages. Since 5.0 we have required Sphinx to be installed to build the docs (see https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/5.0#Build_Dependencies).

Pass --enable-docs to configure if you want to force the docs to be built (and then configure will stop with an error if Sphinx or another required tool is missing); otherwise configure will default to "build docs if possible, skip if required tools are missing".


There is only one shared man-page for all qemu-system-xxx binaries ... have you tried to simply run "man qemu" ?

Hello together,

build with enable-docs and install the required packages now it works with man qemu. 

Many thanks for you help

Problem resolved :-)

Best regards
Damian
