ppc64 + virtio-scsi: only first scsi disk shows up in the guest

When adding two virtio-scsi targets to a single guest, only the first
disk is seen inside the guest.  For some unknown reason the guest
doesn't enumerate the second disk.

For full qemu-system-ppc64 command line and 'dmesg' output, see:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2012-06/msg02430.html

I have also tried this with Linus's git tree (3.5.0-rc2+ at time of writing),
same thing.

In both cases I'm using qemu from git.

Can you test whether the spapr-vscsi controller works instead?

Yes, that works fine, both disks seen by the guest.

Only just saw this bug, I assume the problem still exist ? I have somebody look at it next week

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU and guest kernel? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Closed it, very old bug and we successfully test many disks with ppc64/le nowadays.
