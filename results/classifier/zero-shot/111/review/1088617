qemu-system-mipsel save/restore broken

Save and restore on mipsel seems to be broken (tested with commit 1c97e303d4ea80a2691334b0febe87a50660f99d). To reproduce:

1. Download debian_squeeze_mipsel_standard.qcow2 and vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta from from http://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/mipsel/

2. Boot the system. I had to ^D past a Bus error in fsck, which may be another bug (haven't investigated). The command line used was:
qemu-system-mipsel -M malta -kernel vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta -hda debian_squeeze_mipsel_standard.qcow2 -append "root=/dev/sda1 console=tty0" -k en-us -vnc :0

3. Once the system is booted, go to the monitor and do "savevm booted". Then quit.

4. Re-run qemu-system-mipsel again with "-loadvm booted". The guest system comes back but is hung (the monitor remains responsive, however).

I also captured a debug log, which is attached. The immediate cause of the freeze seems to be that it's stuck in a loop repeatedly handling the same page fault over and over.



Triaging old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU?
