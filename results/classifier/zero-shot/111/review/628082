nl-be keymap is wrong

As mentioned on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kvm/+bug/429965 as well as the kvm mailinglist (http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/14413), the nl-be keymap does not work. The number keys above the regular keys (non-numeric keypad numbers) as well as vital keys such as slash, backslash, dash, ... are not working.

The nl-be keymap that is presented in the above URLs (and also attached to this bug) does work properly.

Would it be possible to include this keymap rather than the current one?



Hi, is this still a problem with the latest version of QEMU? If yes, please submit your keymap as a patch to the qemu-devel mailing list (see http://qemu-project.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch for details). Thanks!

There have been quite a lot of changes with regards to keyboard mapping in QEMU recently, could you please try again with QEMU 2.12 to see whether this has been fixed now?
