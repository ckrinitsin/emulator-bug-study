This bug would be better reported to the upstream for the ipxe rom -- we just ship the source code because we ship the binary.


Thank you, I contacted IPXE folks.

Should be fixed here:
http://git.ipxe.org/ipxe.git/commitdiff/956f6a722

Btw. how do you pull changes from ipxe into qemu repo?

The next step is a QEMU patch which updates our git submodule
to point at a version of IPXE with the fix and also has the
pre-built binaries corresponding to that new version.

Gerd, it looks like you did the last IPXE update -- could
we do another one with this fix in it?

thanks

Yes, makes sense to do that, last ipxe rebase was more than a year ago.

cheers,

In QEMU commit fd813c72392a712022d5d75a9 we upgraded our ipxe, so this bug should now be fixed in git master and in the upcoming 4.0 release.
