OpenSolaris guest fails to see the Solaris partitions of a physical disk in qemu-kvm-9999 (GIT)

# qemu-kvm --version
QEMU emulator version 0.13.50 (qemu-kvm-devel), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

The following disk is presented to guest as IDE disk with /dev/sdd as path.

# fdisk -l /dev/sdd

Disk /dev/sdd: 750.2 GB, 750156374016 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 91201 cylinders, total 1465149168 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x7f3a03aa

The prtvtoc output is attached from both VirtualBox and Qemu-KVM. As can be seen in the screenshots, a valid Solaris partition table (which is inside the /dev/sdd3, marked 'bf' in Linux fdisk output) is not seen in Qemu but seen in Virtualbox.

This makes the guest unbootable in Qemu because the root FS is not found but its bootable in Virtualbox.





Qemu's version of partition table is gotten using a OpenSolaris b134 livecd because I couldn't really boot the disk.

Basically, somehow all the slice labels are missing when booted in Qemu. OpenSolaris thinks that /dev/sdd3 (which is a primary Solaris 'bf' type partition) is not sliced. Hence, its showing 2 unmountable slices and 1 reserved slice.

When booted in VirtualBox, the correct slice table is seen. We can see slice 0 being 'root' slice of about 16GB, slice 1 being 'swap' slice of size about 6GB and slice 6 being the 'data' slice of about 26GB.

This is a showstopper bug for me to adopt KVM as the virtualization solution because I just can't boot my OpenSolaris guest. I want to move to KVM because of in-kernel support and better SMP support.

I ran qemu from command line with debugcon:

Why are PCHS and LCHS both wrong?

I thought C*H*S was equal to the physical size. if c <16384, h<16, s<63 for the physical, then max size disk it can support is about 8GB. what gives?

And C*H*S IS equal to the disk size as shown in the fdisk -l output above.

Since I have been battling this issue alone in this bug report, here is the deal: Attached is the patch which applies to 12.5 and 13.5 and fixes the issue.

Can someone please verify the integrity and apply?

hello? anybody home?

Please send the patch to the qemu-devel list. Don't forget a
Signed-off-by: line.

What's this bugdb for then? I now have to subscribe to a list, just to send the patch?

It's probably there to report bugs. But it's much easier to review
submitted code when it's sent to the list. I don't think you have to
be a subscriber.

what's the list address? All the lists at the kvm main page are for kvm only.

Sorry, I missed that this was for qemu-kvm. Anyway, the patch is
probably applicable to QEMU as well and you actually filed the bug to
Qemu.

qemu-devel list information can be found in
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/qemu-devel

Did this change get submitted? Is it still an issue?

At least the patch hasn't been applied. I don't remember seeing it in the list.


Is this issue still reproducible with the latest version of QEMU, or could we close this issue nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
