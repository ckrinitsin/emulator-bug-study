savevm fails with inserted CD, "Device '%s' is writable but does not support  snapshots."

Hi,

yesterday unfortunately a customer reported a failed snapshot of his VM. Going through the logfile I discovered:

"Device 'ide1-cd0' is writable but does not support snapshots"

this is with qemu-1.2.0 and 1.0.1 at least...

Why writeable?
Even if I specify "-drive ...,readonly=on,snapshot=off" to qemu the monitor-command sees the CD-ROM-device as being writeable?!

Somewhere I saw a "hint" for blockdev.c:

after installing with this small patch applied it works, so insert CD, savevm <somename> succeeds.
This should be fixed at all correct places, and the tags "readonly=on,snapshot=off" should do it, too. Or even just work after specifying a drive being a CD-rom should do the trick ;-)

Another "bad habit" is, that the ISO/DVD-file has to be writeable to be changed?

Thnx for attention and regards,

Oliver.

Very old bug. If anyone sees this behavior, please re-file against a supported release (5.0 at time of writing, soon to be 5.1) and please paste a full command-line and steps to reproduce.

(To my knowledge, this bug is not present in modern QEMU builds, but do not know when it would have changed.)
