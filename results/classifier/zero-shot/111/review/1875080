USB host device data transfer with control endpoint

QEMU emulator version 4.2.0
Host -> Arch Linux kernel version: 5.4.34-1-lts
Guest -> Various Linux Distros

I sent a control message with data through endpoint zero.
On the other side message is received with all fields correct except data buffer.
I've tested the data field inside guest with usbmon and data field was correct but after packet leaved qemu, data filed is lost.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
