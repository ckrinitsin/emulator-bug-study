Multiple (Repeating) Keystrokes in macOS

Hi,

I am finding this issue with v4.2.0, or the latest master - on a Windows host, with macOS guest. It happens using gtk (SPICE?) or VNC. When I get to a place to enter a keystroke, I quite reliably get multiple of the same key (i.e. press A, get AAAA).

Thinking there may be a basic setting to address this? I did try it in Linux (kvm), no issue there.

Thanks!

BTW, it does make the guest unusable ... can't even enter a password (if I could get that far, having issues even running setup).

Thanks!

Issues with time emulation. MacOS runs on qemu with a specific cpu option: -cpu Penryn,vendor=GenuineIntel,+invtsc,vmware-cpuid-freq=on.
The code of cpu_x86_cpuid has no handler for 0x40000010, so vmware-cpuid-freq is ignored.
Another solution is to modify tsc_increment_by_tick value in MSR_IA32_PERF_STATUS returned from helper_rdmsr. Currently it is val = 1000ULL. Try to set it to 2000ULL, and see what happens.

The solution for hardware emulation is to return real hardware values to the guest. I think for tcg it can be passed from command line, so the user can adjust it's value.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
