Cannot boot FreeBSD on versatilepb machine

I know some years ago it was possible to boot FreeBSD in QEMU versatilepb machine
https://kernelnomicon.org/?p=229 (you can download image and kernel using web.archive.org)
Now when I try to do that I get only black screen with no output even in QEMU console.
I also added -global versatile_pci.broken-irq-mapping=1, but this seem to have no effect.

What version did this last work on? What version have you tested that failed? Have you tried the latest QEMU HEAD build? What was the full command line of your invocation?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
