disas/i386.c compile error

QEMU Version: 2.12.1, 3.0.0-rc4
Compiling with GCC 8.2.0
System: Plop Linux, 32 bit 

Error:
  CC      disas/i386.o
/tmp/ccK8tHRs.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/ccK8tHRs.s:53353: Error: can't resolve `L0' {*ABS* section} - `obuf' {.bss section}


The problematic line is in 'disas/i386.c' in the function 'INVLPG_Fixup (int bytemode, int sizeflag)':
strcpy (obuf + strlen (obuf) - 6, alt);

If I comment out this line, then compiling works without problems.


The error comes only on 32 bit. On 64 bit, compiling works without problems.

Looking through old bug tickets ... This sounds like it was rather a bug in your toolchain ... is it still reproducible with a newer version of your Linux distro and the latest version of QEMU?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
