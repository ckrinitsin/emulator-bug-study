ppc fails to clear MSR_POW when incurring exception

QEMU VERSION: 0.12.4

According to FreeScale's 'Programming Environments Manual for 32-bit Implementations of the PowerPC Architecture' [MPCFPE32B, Rev.3, 9/2005], section 6.5, table 6-7, an interrupt resets MSR_POW to zero but qemu-0.12.4 fails to do so.
Resetting the bit is necessary in order to bring the processor out of power-management since otherwise it goes to sleep right away in the exception handler, i.e., it is impossible to leave PM-mode.

This doesn't look right. POW shouldn't even get stored in SRR1. Could
you please redo the patch and make sure that mtmsr masks out MSR_POW?

I'm afraid I don't understand. My the problem and fix doesn't address mtmsr at all.
It just makes sure MSR_POW is cleared in MSR when an exception occurs.

Do you mean MSR_POW should masked from MSR before saving it to SRR1?
That's already taken care of (target-ppc/helper.c:2074 [qemu-0.12.4]).

As far as I can see, this problem has been fixed by this commit here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=41557447d30eeb944e4
... so I'm setting the status to "Fix released" now.
