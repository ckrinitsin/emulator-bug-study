qemu git -vnc fails due to missing en-us keymap

If trying to run qemu with -vnc :0, it will fail with:
./qemu-system-x86_64 -vnc :2
qemu-system-x86_64: -vnc :2: could not read keymap file: 'en-us'

share/keymaps is missing en-us keymap and only has sl and sv, confirmed previous stable versions had en-us. 

Tried with multiple targets, on arm64 and amd64

Git commit hash: 9435a8b3dd35f1f926f1b9127e8a906217a5518a (head)

A work around to get vnc enabled for those that need it until this is fixed is to manually copy from source tree pc-bios/keymaps/* to qemu-data keymaps directory, usually installed at /usr/share/qemu/keymaps or /usr/local/share/qemu/keymaps (default prefix). 

Commit that broke the install of keymaps is either https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/09db9b9db38e82acbc1fd4fa4661ac19c387380c (commit hash 09db9b9db38e82acbc1fd4fa4661ac19c387380c)

or https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/ddcf607fa3d6881cf0286a9b88a40fde265cbe37 (commit hash ddcf607fa3d6881cf0286a9b88a40fde265cbe37)


I can also reproduce this issue. +CC Gerd Hoffmann

Confirmed also a problem on the Windows build. Work around is to copy en-us file from 
C:\Program Files\qemu\keymaps to qemu folder.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU
(currently version 6.0), then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
