SS-5 emulation doesn't work with Sun boot ROM


The 32-bit SPARC emulator's TCX emulation seems to work with OpenBIOS, but doesn't work with a SparcStation ROM on Cocoa.  Screenshot attached.  Using version 1.7.0 on Mac OS X 10.9 via MacPorts and compiled directly from source, though this problem has carried over from Mac OS X 10.8 and many earlier versions of Qemu.

The following is my Qemu command:

sudo qemu-system-sparc -m 256 -M SS-5 -bios /home/img/ROMs/sun/ss5-170.bin \
  -g 1024x768x24 \
  -drive file=/home/doc/VMs/slagheap/sd0.raw,if=scsi,bus=0,unit=3 \
  -drive file=/home/doc/VMs/slagheap/sd1.raw,if=scsi,bus=0,unit=1 \
  -drive file=/home/doc/VMs/slagheap/sd2.raw,if=scsi,bus=0,unit=2 \
  -net nic,macaddr=DE:EE:DD:FF:EE:DD,model=lance \
  -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=/home/doc/VMs/slagheap/ifup,downscript=/home/doc/VMs/slagheap/ifdown

Note: also can't compile Qemu w/ SDL support from MacPorts on Mac OS X, and config.log is not helpful to figure out why, but this is another issue.

This is actually two separate issues.

(1) This SS-5 ROM doesn't boot on QEMU. You can see this if
you try it on a Linux host : the display stays black.

(2) The Cocoa UI frontend doesn't black the screen on startup
(or on resize) the way the SDL frontend does, so if the guest
hasn't tried to display anything to the screen post-resize you
get the old garbage of the window decoration displayed.

We should probably fix (2), though it's only a cosmetic issue
and you won't even see it if you have a functioning guest.
I expect you care more about (1) and you'll do better with a
bug report that's clear that it's a generic SPARC guest issue.

thanks

Please accept my apology if I'm missing something, but I don't understand what you mean by #1; this ROM actually *does* boot on QEMU.  Just not without the "-nographic" option.

-peter

Ah, I hadn't tried -nographic. However, my general point still stands: whether you run this on MacOS or Linux, you get the same behaviour.

Experimenting I see that all that's happening here is that '-nographic' gives you a serial console, which the ROM outputs to. You can also specify that with '-serial stdio' instead, in which case you get ROM output to the terminal and a blank display. So the two parts of this bug are:

(1) no graphics output with this ROM
(2) cocoa UI doesn't properly show a black window if there is no graphics output from the guest

I have some patches which fix (2).

(If you have a bug which is a general QEMU emulation bug, it's a really bad idea to describe it using phrases like"on Cocoa" or "on MacOS" which suggest that it's a MacOS host specific bug, because this will mean that it will get ignored by almost all the developers, most of whom use Linux. If you have access to a suitable machine it's definitely helpful to try reproducing on a Linux box before reporting a bug. If you've only been able to test on Mac you should say so somewhere in the bug report, though.)


These two patches for the Cocoa UI:
  http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/304879/
  http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/304878/

fix issue (2) so Cocoa now also displays a plain black window for this guest, like the SDL frontend does on Linux.

FWIW this should now work if you replace the QEMU,tcx.bin file from QEMU 
1.7/master with the one uploaded to this bug: 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1262081.

As OpenBIOS doesn't have its own git infrastructure, I need to get the 
git.qemu.org git-svn mirror updated by Anthony in order to send a pull 
request with updated binaries (Blue Swirl set up OpenBIOS to build as a 
git submodule from the git.qemu.org mirror). I'll try and get them 
updated as soon as I can.


ATB,

Mark.



Thanks, Peter ... will do, definitely have Linux and can use it to test in the future before reporting other bugs.  That said, I think you can close this one.
