Emulated monitor EDID reports too few available graphics resolutions

In a Windows guest, not very many resolution modes are available.  The available modes are restricted by what the virtual "monitor" EDID reports via DDC.  And apparently, your fake monitor has a short list of modes.  Please add some more modes like 1152x864, at least.  But what would be REALLY nice is much finer granularity so that users can set the guest res to be just enough smaller than the host display so that window decorations and such fit.

If you use -vga std of -vga vmware, you'll have a much larger choice of resolutions.

For -vga vmware, it's actually possible to add custom resolutions but we don't have the tooling to make that user friendly today.  I'll mark this bug as a wish list to track adding that feature.

As mentioned in comment #1, -vga std is the way to go, so marking this ticket now as "Won't fix".
