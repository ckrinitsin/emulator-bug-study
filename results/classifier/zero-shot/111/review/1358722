latest acpi commits causes memory allocation fault in macosx

qemu release 2.1.0

Hi,
I've found a regression on MacOSX guest (10.9.4) after merging the following commits 

18045fb9f457a0f0cba2bd113c748a2dcb4ed39e pc: future-proof migration-compatibility of ACPI tables
868270f23d8db2cce83e4f082fe75e8625a5fbf9 acpi-build: tweak acpi migration limits

The migration limits make x86 chameleon bootloader generate a memory allocation error with 0xdeadbeef address at line 899 in source file:

http://forge.voodooprojects.org/p/chameleon/source/tree/2360/branches/Bungo/i386/libsaio/acpi_patcher.c

I've not tried to recompile chameleon yet.

The experiments for running MacOSXon KVM/QEMU I followed are here: http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~somlo/OSXKVM/

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
