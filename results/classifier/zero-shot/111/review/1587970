QEMU Crashes when attaching USB 3.00 devices to xhci bus

Using qemu 2.6 with a windows7 32-bit VM, if I plug a USB 3.0 memory stick in to a USB 3.0 port, then pass it through to the VM via the monitor (device_add usb-host,bus=xhci.0,hostbus=xx,hostaddr=xx,id=stick1) then qemu asserts and dies - I have seen 2 different asserts one is from the xchi module - Assertion `intr->er_full, and one is in core.c (line 400 I IIRCC) with "Assertion dev->state == 3 failed"
Tried to work around by only passing in an ehci controller to the VM, but then if I attach a usb 3.0 memory stick to that it doesn't work in windows.
I have made sure the xhci drivers in the windows VM are up to date, latest version of SeaBios etc, but at the moment, I have had to disable xhci in my system bios and just use ehci for everything.

I also had this problem. You can try to configure the VM with core=1 and thread=1. See if the "intr->er_full" assertion still exist.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
