qemu: uncaught target signal 5 (Trace/breakpoint trap)

I'm getting core dumped when running the attached a.out_err binary in qemu, but when using Gdb to remote-debug the program, it exited normally. will appreciate if you can help look into this qemu issue.

And I found that QEMU's 32-bit arm linux-user mode doesn't correctly turn guest BKPT insns into SIGTRAP signal.

And I have check that the bug(https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1873898) is fixed.
But it's coredump.

It seem to can not upload a binary?
