qemu-img created VMDK files lead to "Unsupported or invalid disk type 7"

Using qemu-img version 3.1.50 (v3.1.0-13607-geb2db0f7ba-dirty) on a Windows 10 machine.

Converting a VHD to VMDK.
qemu-img.exe convert "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vhd" -O vmdk -o adapter_type=buslogic -p "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vmdk"

I have also tried:
qemu-img.exe convert "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vhd" -O vmdk -o adapter_type=buslogic,hwversion=6 -p "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vmdk"

Attaching the VMDK to a VM in VMware produces the following error when powering on.

Power On virtual machine:Failed to open disk scsi0:1: Unsupported or invalid disk type 7. Ensure that the disk has been imported.
Target: MyVM1
vCenter Server: VCENTER
Error Stack
An error was received from the ESX host while powering on VM MyVM1.
Failed to start the virtual machine.
Module DevicePowerOn power on failed. 
Unable to create virtual SCSI device for scsi0:1, '/vmfs/volumes/5cca0155-bdddf31d-2714-00215acbeb1e/AppD-VM01/AppDdisk1-VM01.vmdk' 
Failed to open disk scsi0:1: Unsupported or invalid disk type 7. Ensure that the disk has been imported.


If I do not specify the adapter type, it creates an IDE VMDK which works perfectly.

Which version of VMware are you running?

Hi, I'm running 5.5.

I've been playing around with some of the options, and if I run the below, I end up with 2 files.

qemu-img.exe convert "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vhd" -O vmdk -o adapter_type=lsilogic,subformat=monolithicFlat -p "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vmdk"

The files I get are:
AppD-VM01.vmdk (which is always 12kb)
AppD-VM01-flat.vmdk (which is the full size of the disk, eg 30GB).

If I then upload both of these files to the datastore, they somehow merge into 1 and I can attach and power on the VM. If you dont upload both files into the datastore, VMware does not recognise it.

This is the only method that seems to work for me.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
