qemu-img convert malfunction on macOS

On macOS 10.13.6, `qemu-img convert` failed to convert a qcow2 into a new qcow2 (for the purpose of shrinking the image).

A 50GB (3.7GB allocated) qcow2 image was used as source. The qemu-img convert output was a 3.4MB file. 

qemu-img from HomeBrew were tested. Both 2.11.1 and 3.1.0_1 failed to convert a qcow2 image.

Preliminary debugging seems to hint that wrong image convert status for some sectors during iteration in convert_do_copy() accumulated a much smaller allocated_sectors than it should.

Possibly a duplicate of https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1776920

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
