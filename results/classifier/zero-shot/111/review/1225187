qemu hangs in windows 7 host with -serial pipe:windbg

Execution line:
qemu-system-i386.exe -m 512 c:\Disks\Qemu_XP_en.vhd  -serial pipe:windbg

It waits for the pipe.
Execute windbg
c:\WINDDK\7600.16385.1\Debuggers\windbg.exe -k com:pipe,port=\\.\pipe\windbg,resets=0,reconnect

GUI black screen shown. QEMU hangs.

qemu v1.5.3 (c0b1a7e207094dba0b37a892b41fe4cab3195e44). MinGW built.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

Tested and this issue still affects the latest version of QEMU (8.2.0) compiled for Windows.

Instructions in original post are still sufficient to reproduce the problem on Windows 7 x64.
Both i386 and x86_64 were tested and both result in a hung QEMU process.

The GUI does not open until after the other end of the pipe connects (to WinDbg or other).

Using -display gtk results in a hung GUI window with a white screen.
Using -display sdl results in a responsive GUI window, but the VM is still hung after the text "SeaBIOS (version rel-...)" is printed to the screen.

Running with "-d trace:serial_read,trace:serial_write,trace:serial_update_parameters" results in the following output to the console:
serial_update_parameters baudrate=9600 parity='N' data=5 stop=1
serial_update_parameters baudrate=9600 parity='N' data=5 stop=1

I can post additional logs if provided with appropriate parameters for QEMU.
