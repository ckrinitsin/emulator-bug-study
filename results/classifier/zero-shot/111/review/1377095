KVM guest VM does not reattach a throughpassed USB printer from Host after switching printer off and on


Host OS: Gentoo, all packages built 2014-10-01

qemu version 2.1.0-r1

Linux kernel 3.14.14   x86_64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3220T CPU @ 2.80GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux


Guest VM: Debian 7 (Wheezy) Linux 3.2.0 686


Start command:
/usr/bin/qemu-system-i386 -enable-kvm -name wheezy -k de -serial null -parallel null -hda /var/kvm/wheezy.kvm-img -daemonize -net nic,macaddr=02:00:00:00:01:31 -net tap,ifname=tap3,script=no,downscript=no -m 512 -pidfile /var/run/kvm/wheezy.pid -usb -usbdevice tablet -runas myuser -vnc 127.0.0.1:3 -usbdevice host:04e8:3242

Problem:
USB printer pass-through from KVM host to guest vm only works if I start the qemu kvm when the USB printer (vendor/product ID 04e8:3242) is switched on and therefore shown in lsusb on the host. Then it is available in the started VM.

But when I switch the usb printer attached to the host off, it disappears in lsusb both on the host and the VM (as expected) but when I switch the USB printer on again, it is shown on the host and also on the QEMU Monitor (Crtl Alt Shift 2 -> info usbhost), but in the VM lsusb does not show it again- so USB pass-through / hot plugging does not work. It worked with a previous Version of qemu (1.0 or something).

That is very annoying, because every time I want to print something, I need to shutdown the VM, start the printer, and then start the VM (which runs cups as printer server).
But after printing, I do not want the printer to keep running, so I switch it off.

This is a very annoying bug, and it is still not solved after six months, last versions tested with the bug:

KVM host qemu version 2.2.1

KVM host Linux version 3.14.37

Please fix this.

This is a very annoying bug, and it is still not solved after 2.7 years.
Last versions tested and affected by this bug:

KVM host qemu version 2.9.0

KVM host Linux version 4.9.6 x86_64

Please fix this.


I guess switching the printer off and on again is like attaching a new USB device to your host (so it only shows up in the host, of course, and not in the guest). Have you already tried to do a new "device_add usb-host,..." in the QEMU monitor to attach it to the guest again while the VM is running?

Thanks Thomas for Your suggestion. Unfortunately I cannot achieve the reconnection:

KVM runs with following parameters:

-usb -device usb-host,vendorid=0x04e8,productid=0x3242,id=drucker -monitor unix:qemu-monitor-socket,server,nowait

With the Unix socket, I can now pipe commands to the qemu monitor. This info command works:

echo 'info status' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info status
VM status: running

What I have is this:
- disconnect USB printer (Product Samsung ML-1510_700)
- stop KVM
- connect USB printer
- start KVM

echo 'info usb' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usb
  Device 0.1, Port 1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Tablet
  Device 0.2, Port 2, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Hub
  Device 0.3, Port 2.1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product Samsung ML-1510_700, ID: drucker

Printer works.
- disconnect printer

echo 'info usb' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usb
  Device 0.2, Port 1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Tablet
  Device 0.3, Port 2, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Hub
  Device 0.4, Port 2.1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product Samsung ML-1510_700, ID: drucker

USB Info still shows the printer, allthough it is disconnected.

Remove device from KVM:

echo 'device_del drucker' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket

Printer is removed from the device list:

info usbdrucker' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usb
  Device 0.2, Port 1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Tablet
  Device 0.3, Port 2, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Hub

-connect printer

printer is not shown:

echo 'info usb' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usb
  Device 0.2, Port 1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Tablet
  Device 0.3, Port 2, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Hub

Add printer device:

echo 'device_add usb-host,vendorid=0x04e8,productid=0x3242,id=drucker ' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) device_add usb-host,vendorid=0x04e8,productid=0x3242,id=drucker

echo 'info usb' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usb
  Device 0.2, Port 1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Tablet
  Device 0.3, Port 2, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Hub
  Device 0.0, Port 2.2, Speed 1.5 Mb/s, Product USB Host Device, ID: drucker

Device is shown, but not like when KVM is started with connected printer: Speed only 1.5 Mb/s, no vendor and product info.

Printer does _not_ work.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
