unable to migrate non shared storage when TLS is used

Operating system: Gentoo
Architecture: x86_64
kernel version: 5.4.72, 5.10.11
libvirt version: at least 6.9.0, 6.10.0, 7.0.0
Hypervisor and version: qemu 5.1.0, 5.2.0

With software versions described above and following configurations:
libvirt:
key_file = "/etc/ssl/libvirt/server.lan.key"
cert_file = "/etc/ssl/libvirt/server.lan.crt"
ca_file = "/etc/ssl/libvirt/ca.crt"
log_filters="3:remote 4:event 3:util.json 3:rpc 1:*"
log_outputs="1:file:/var/log/libvirt/libvirtd.log"
qemu:
default_tls_x509_cert_dir = "/etc/ssl/qemu"
default_tls_x509_verify = 1
migration with tls:
virsh # migrate vm1 qemu+tls://server2.lan/system --persistent --undefinesource --copy-storage-all --verbose --tls
never succeeds. Progress stops typically at high progress amounts (95%-98%), and network traffic drastically drops as well (from 1 gbps+ to nothing). domjobinfo progress also stops. Without --tls migrations succeed without issues without any other changes to hosts or configurations.

Note: I reported this originally as libvirt bug: https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/issues/108.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Eric: Following that libvirt issue it looks like it's block related; something weird happening where only some of the disks are syncing?


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
