OS/2 Warp 3 support broken in 2.11

Hello, I used to run OS/2 Warp 3 on QEMU with the following command line: qemu-system-i386 -vga cirrus -soundhw sb16 -hda os2warp3v2.img -boot c. It runs OK on QEMU 2.10, but immediately gives TRAP 0006 (invalid opcode?) on QEMU 2.11 (see screenshot).
If it is important I have Fixpack 40 and GRADD installed in OS/2.
Here is the image:

This image boots for me without problem with latest version from git so 
either it's already fixed or the problem is elsewhere. Can you try latest 
git version? If it still does not work with that maybe you need to provide 
more details, like configure options or what host arch/OS are you on.



I used QEMU 2.11 for Windows from Stephan Weil (http://qemu.weilnetz.de/). I have Windows 10 (v1709) x64.

No, I've used the same command as in the bug report. Now I've retried with 
explicit -M pc,accel=tcg and -M pc,accel=kvm and it boots without problem 
for me both ways on Linux. If it crashes for you maybe you could try 
bisecting, that's what I was trying to do to help but I can't reproduce 
it.

It looks like this bug affects only QEMU for Windows.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
