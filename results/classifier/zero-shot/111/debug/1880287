gcc crashes in hppa emulation

There seems to be a translation bug in the qemu-hppa (qemu v5.0.0) emulation:
A stripped down testcase (taken from Linux kernel build) is attached.

In there is "a.sh", a shell script which calls gcc-9 (fails with both debian gcc-9.3.0-11 or gcc-9.3.0-12). and "a.iii", the preprocessed source.

When starting a.sh, in the emulation gcc crashes with segfault.
On real hardware gcc succeeds to compile the source.

In a hppa-user chroot running "apt update && apt install gcc-9" should be sufficient to get the needed reproducer environment.



Test still crashes the VM and chroot with up-to-date debian chroot, including updated gcc-9.3.0-14.

Sven Schnelle (<email address hidden>) noticed that increasing
-#define TCG_MAX_TEMPS 512
+#define TCG_MAX_TEMPS 1024
in include/tcg/tcg.h prevents fixes that crash.

Thanks for the debugging.  Failure to free temporaries.
