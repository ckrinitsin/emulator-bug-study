K800 keyboard no longer works when attached to a VM

I use Logitech K800 keyboard which is connected to a PC through Logitech unifying receiver. In order to control my windows VM i attach unifying receiver USB device to a VM using "virsh attach-device VM-Name ./device.xml". Device ID as seen in lsusb is 046d:c52b.

As of v4.1.0 keyboard no longer works when attached to a windows VM. When attached receiver is still at least partially functional. Logitech pairing utility properly displays paired keyboard, pressing buttons on the keyboard shows changing indicator icon in pairing utility. Pairing and unpairing works. Pressing keys however fails to register any key presses.

Downgrading to v4.0.0 fixes the issue.

device.xml used to attach USB device:
```
<hostdev mode='subsystem' type='usb'>
        <source>
                <vendor id='0x046d'/>
                <product id='0xc52b'/>
        </source>
</hostdev>

```



There are only two pass-through changes:

commit bfe44898848614cfcb3a269bc965afbe1f0f331c
commit 65f14ab98da1da920f98ee8734dc1588b01d6b2b

Can you check whenever reverting the one or the other or both restores 4.0 behavior?

Can you add "lsusb -v" output for the device in question to the bug?

Reverting 65f14ab98da1da920f98ee8734dc1588b01d6b2b fixes the issue.

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1176777/

Could you please clarify how this config is supposed to be used? I would test your patch.

qemu: -device usb-host,...,guest-resets-all=true

libvirt:

   <qemu:arg value='-set'/>
   <qemu:arg value='device.hostdev0.guest-resets-all=true'/>

... assuming this is is the only pass-through device.

If you pass through more devices you''l have hostdev0, hostdev1, ... and have to pick the correct one.

(see also http://blog.vmsplice.net/2011/04/how-to-pass-qemu-command-line-options.html)

I am bit slow to test, but i just realized that i am still not sure how to test this. My devices are attached using "virsh attach" after system has started. So it seems to me there is no way to test it with libvirt. A global option to restore old behavior would be useful until libvirt starts supporting this option.

Patch has been included here:
https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=1dfe2b91dcb1633d0ba450
... and been released with QEMU v4.2

Any way to get old behavior back when using `virsh attach` command? Devices are not attached on boot. I am stuck with qemu 4.0 because of this.

Try this:

   <qemu:arg value='-global'/>
   <qemu:arg value='usb-host.guest-resets-all=true'/>

Not fully sure this works for hotplugged devices though.


It works with virsh device-attach. Thank you very much.
