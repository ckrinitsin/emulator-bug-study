Thanks for the information.

Hey Chuck-

You marked this confirmed... Are you able to reproduce this?

Hi Sarunas-

Were you able to install windows7 and just the reboot failed?  Or are you using a windows7 image that was installed elsewhere (or otherwise)?

Anthony, any idea of the state of 64bit Windows7 on a 64bit QEMU host?

I was able to install windows7 and just the reboot failed. It all works in VirtualBox OSE though.

Looks like the install failed to succeed and there was not an MBR written.
