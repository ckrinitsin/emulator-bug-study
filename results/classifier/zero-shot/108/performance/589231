cirrus vga is very slow in qemu-kvm-0.12

As has been reported multiple times (*), there were a regression in qemu-kvm from 0.11 to 0.12, which causes significant slowdown in cirrus vga emulation.  For windows guests, where "standard VGA" driver works reasonable well, -vga std is a good workaround. But for e.g. linux guests, where vesa driver is painfully slow by its own, that's not a solution.

QEMU 0.12 is pretty much outdated - has this been fixed in a newer version of QEMU? I.e. do you think we can close this bug nowadays?
