Performance improvement when using "QEMU_FLATTEN" with softfloat type conversions

Attached below is a matrix multiplication program for double data
types. The program performs the casting operation "(double)rand()"
when generating random numbers.

This operation calls the integer to float softfloat conversion
function "int32_to_float_64".

Adding the "QEMU_FLATTEN" attribute to the function definition
decreases the instructions per call of the function by about 63%.

Attached are before and after performance screenshots from
KCachegrind.







Confirmed, although "65% decrease" is on 0.44% of the total
execution for this test case, so the decrease isn't actually
noticeable.

Nevertheless, it's a simple enough change.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
