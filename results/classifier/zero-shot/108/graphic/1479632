dos crashing no sound 

I use this command  when I use sound in a program there is no sound and sometimes the program crashes or hangs with no mouse 
working. I can though reset with the system with  the control menu, but this is further hard to use, because there is no option to scroll through all the commands, I did not visited a wiki page yet.

This is my command.

qemu-system-i386  -soundhw all -m 1g -boot menu=on -hda dos622_1.img -boot d

I have quite freed up some memory, but that didn't help.

I used qemu because of a bug in dosbox, but that appeared to be the unclutter program and  I have now uninstalled it.

Not to mention that I did not knew that qemu is in such a beta phase.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Hello, I also am afraid thet in the image there is no sound driver,
maybe that's the problem.
And its so long ago that you can close it.
