vdagent is not working properly after live migration
Additional information:
when validating on windows server 2016 Datacenter Evaluation, i found that if vdagent process or vdservice is restarted, copy/paste from host to guest or reverse will work again. i am wondering if we should send something(eg, a event?) to guest to let it reopen the port after live migration?
