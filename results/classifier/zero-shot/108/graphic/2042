Not able to reboot Linux guest on Windows host
Description of problem:
I am running Linux Mint on Windows, but when I try to reboot the machine, I get the following error:

qemu: WHPX: Unexpected VP exit code 4

I did some experiments changing the flags I use when I launch Qemu and I realized that if I set -smp 1 it does not fail. Furthermore, if I set the irqchip to off (kernel-irqchip=off) it does not fail either, but both options do not have good performance at all. I realized too that if I set 4 cores (-smp 4), the error might appear up to 4 times.

What seems to be failing then is the APIC emulation that Hyper-V provides. Does anyone know if:

1. Am I missing a flag when launching Qemu?
2. Is it there a patch to solve this?

Any leads for solving this problem would be highly appreciated.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install MSYS
2. Open MSYS and run pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qemu
3. Launch Qemu and reboot machine
