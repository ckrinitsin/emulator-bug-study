Hang During Initramfs
Description of problem:
[Hang During Initramfs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/QEMU#Hang_during_VM_initramfs)
Is this still not fixed? I hang at startup. Previously I tried WIN11 and it booted fine.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download Windows10 ISO
2. qemu-img create -f raw Windows10 15G
3. qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom Win10.iso -boot order=d -drive file=Windows10,format=raw -m 4G

`-enable-kvm` works but i removed it to slow down a bit to see what is going on.
