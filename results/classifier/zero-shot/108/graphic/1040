Windows Server 2016 VM totally freezes spontaneously during the day a couple of times for 1-5 minutes. There is no any logs in it during the freeze
Description of problem:
Windows Server 2016 VM totally freezes spontaneously during the day a couple of times for 1-5 minutes. There is no any logs inside VM during the freeze. Timestamp of the last log written into journal is right before the freeze and the pretty next log is right after the freeze is gone. Looks like "black hole". No ping from from the host toward the VM. There is no way to connect to the VM even via spice on virt-manager as well. Seems like the VM is suspending. Htop on the host during the time of the freeze shows 100% load of all eight cores dedicated to the VM. But the host system is available and reachable, the lxc's inside this host is available and reachable as well.
