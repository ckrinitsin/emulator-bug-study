Can qemu support different core on one machine?
Description of problem:
I want to build a machine, including three core which is different types, arm Cortex-M3 core, cortex-m33 core, contex-a53 core, communicate through mailbox. I checked the current implementation of QEMU and saw that a machine uses a core, such as mps2.c virt.c . I want to know whether the QEMU strategy supports different types of cores on one machine and can communicate with each other.
Thanks.
