qemu-img fails to create images >= 4G

On a Windows XP system and an NTFS drive, using QEMU on Windows Ver 0.12.2 from http://homepage3.nifty.com/takeda-toshiya/qemu/ or QEMU 0.12.3 or d3538b45ea88e82d1b01959b4ca55d3696b71cb2 built locally, when I run the following command, a zero-length file is created.

 qemu-img create foo.img 4G

Confirmed under Win 7 64-bit.
Also does same thing on v10.6, v11.1, v12.1

what a zero-length file means? Run the following command to see

Sorry, I accidentally submitted comment #3 without finishing it.

I was going to say that when I tried QEMU 2.6.50 on a Windows 7 Professional system, it appears to have created the image file successfully.

Thanks for the update ... since it is working with the current version of QEMU, I assume this problem has been fixed sometimes during the past years, thus we can close this ticket now.
