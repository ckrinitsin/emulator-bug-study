VI.EXE crashes on start under QEMU; works under BOCHS
Description of problem:
vi.exe hangs on startup; can be verified to work in bochs
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run vi.exe from DOS prompt; hang is evident immediately as ~ ~ ~ ~ doesn't show up
Additional information:
Actual [vi.exe](/uploads/d77076b8187489253c6ad8f1ab3ec247/vi.exe) attached; it's ridiculously old; the kind of thing that belongs on archive.org; I think I actually own this copy program by inheritance; but if the copyright holder objects we'll have to take it down again. :(
