qemu-kvm -m bigger 4096 aborts with 'Bad ram offset'

When I try to start a virtual machine (x86_64 guest on a x86_64 host that has 32GB memory, using kvm_amd module, both host and guest running linux-2.6.39 kernels) with "qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu host -smp 2 -m 4096 ...", shortly after the guest kernel starts, qemu aborts with a message "Bad ram offset 11811c000".

With e.g. "-m 3500" (or lower), the virtual machine runs fine.

I experience this both using qemu-kvm 0.14.1 and a recent version from git

After updating from the QEMU that came with Ubuntu 11.04 to 070411-1ubuntu2 version, I am seeing the bad ram offset error, also.  If I drop the memory for the guest (which is Windows 7 Pro 64-bit) from 4 GB to 3300MB, the error goes away.

Host machine has an AMD Opteron 6128 with 32GB RAM and is running the 64 bit version of Ubuntu 11.04 updated to current versions as of November 

Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU?
