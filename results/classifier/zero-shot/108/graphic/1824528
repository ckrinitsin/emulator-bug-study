qemu fails to compile on gcc 9 `error: taking address of packed member of ‘struct <anonymous>’ may result in an unaligned pointer value [-Werror=address-of-packed-member]`

Tried to patch as below and it compiles fine, not sure if this is right fix though,

This struct represents the MTP protocol wire format so *must* be marked packed.

There unfortunately quite a few flaws in this MTP code area, so fixing the gcc warning is not straightforward.

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-03/msg07763.html

As a workaround, the simplest thing is to configure with --disable-werror, which will reduce these from errors to warnings. (This is the default if you're building from one of our release tarballs, but for builds from git we default to making all warnings into errors so we catch and fix them quickly.)


Sure, Thanks, using the workaround to proceed.

Good if each commit goes through a automated build test across different platforms vs gcc versions.

Fixed in

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-04/msg02524.html

The fixes for this issue in dev-mtp.c are now in QEMU git master and will be in the 4.1 release.
