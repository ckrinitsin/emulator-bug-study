slight screen corruption when maximizing window

Host: Ubuntu disco
qemu-kvm: 1:3.1+dfsg-2ubuntu2
libvirt: 5.0.0-1ubuntu2


Guest: ubuntu bionic
guest is using cirrus video, with the extra modules kernel package installed and the cirrus kernel module loaded

A non-maximized terminal window works just fine. As an example, I run "lsmod". It fills the screen, which then scrolls a bit.

The moment I maximize that window, though, the rendering breaks. I can see the commands I type, but not their output. See attached video.



lsmod run on a non-maximized window. All looks good.

continuing from the previous screenshot, all I did here was to click the maximize button. We can already see some bad rendering on the top right corner.

Here, with the maximized window, I typed several commands again: lsmod, clear, clear. If you look carefully, you can see the clear at the bottom, then at the top again, and nothing changes. All I can see are the characters I type, but not the command's output or effect. The screen doesn't clear, and the list of modules produced by "lsmod" doesn't appear.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
