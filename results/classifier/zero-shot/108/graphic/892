Ensure qemu-storage-daemon builds, works and is included in win10 setup
Additional information:
- Job run on 20220315 "msys2-64bit build target" seems to have created binary: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/jobs/2201739711
  - ```2456 [1324/1586] Linking target storage-daemon/qemu-storage-daemon.exe```
  - I hope it will be included in final distributed setup files
