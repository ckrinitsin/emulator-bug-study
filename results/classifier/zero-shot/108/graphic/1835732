GTK display zoom in, zooms infinitely

The zoom in feature in the "View" menu of the gtk frontend (launch qemu with -display gtk), seems to be very broken.

If I hit the zoom in feature, it first zooms in.

Then, it zooms in again.

Every subsequent second that passes, it zooms in again, until it eventually eats up too much host resources and freezes the host desktop.

I have seen this with 3.1.0 (Debian 1:3.1+dfsg-8~deb10u1), and also with a locally built 4.0, My colleague also confirms having seen the issue with 3.1.0 (Debian 1:3.1+dfsg-8).

This seems to work for me

Can you confirm:
  a) Guest OS and version
  b) Guest desktop environment
  c) Host OS version
  d) Host desktop env
  e) The full command line you used for qemu.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
