Swapping caps lock and control causes qemu confusion

Running Fedora14 [host], I have caps-lock and control swapped over in my keyboard preferences.

Qemu doesn't cope very well with this; running an OS inside Qemu (again fedora, suspect that it doesn't matter):

The physical caps-lock key [which the host uses as control] toggles caps-lock on both press and release.

The physical control key [which the host uses as caps-lock], acts as both a caps-lock and control key.

Qemu should either respect my keyboard layout or else ignore it completely.

Which interface is this?

I suspect this behaves differently in GTK/SDL/...

Also it seems to WorkForMe(tm) mostly. qemu tends to ignore the layout completely so installing same keymap in host and guest gives consistent result, and other configurations give inconsistent but correct result.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
