APIC unusable on QEMU

The APIC is unusable with QEMU using x86-64 system emulation.  Problem exists in the latest stable QEMU 0.12.5 as well as the latest git head.  I am using Mac OS X 10.6, 64-bit version of QEMU.

The QEMU binary was configured with:

 ./configure --target-list=i386-softmmu,x86_64-softmmubck-i-search: conf_      

Problem is that the hw/apic.c file (as well as a few other naughty files) rely on the cpu_single_env global - which is set to NULL in cpu-exec.c.

Below is a test reading the local APIC version register:

Before taking it out:

(qemu) xp 0xfee00030
00000000fee00030: 0x00000000
(qemu)

After:

(qemu) xp 0xfee00030
00000000fee00030: 0x00050011
(qemu)

Quick fix below.  I don't know if there are any side effects with this, if this is OK maybe we can fix it like this for the stable versions and fix the HEAD to not rely on the cpu_single_env global.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
