Windows  qemu download Big file bug in net user mode

hi 

Windows qemu with -net user downloading big files has a bug, -net tap is good!

I suspect that the Slirp protocol has a bug on the Windows pc, which is normal on ubuntu.

What is your version of qemu? I understand you are running qemu on ubuntu.

The VM is windows? which version? Which URL are you downloading? What is the program being used?

thanks
