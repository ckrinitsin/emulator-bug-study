Qemu (trunk code) crashes when using --soundhw all option in ioport.c

After not building qemu (git version) for about 3 weeks, I've done it again this morning.

With up-to-date trunk code, I got this error on start, when using --soundhw all option

$ qemu-system-i386 -soundhw all
qemu-system-i386: /home/fred/Téléchargements/logs/qemu-git/src/qemu/ioport.c:240: portio_list_add: Assertion `pio->offset >= off_last' failed.
Abandon (core dumped)

And if I use only soundhw with one or more options, it doesn't crash.

Tell me what you'll need to fix this bug.

Please always specify the exact version (git commit ID) that you are using... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
