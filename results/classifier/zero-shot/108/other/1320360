usb passthrough not working anymore

Hi,

I'm using qemu 2.0.0 with opensuse 13.1 x84_64 bit as host and window7 as guest. Til qemu version 1.6.2 USB passthrough works perfectly, but starting with qemu 2.0.0 passthrough stop working. I can still add the usb device but when I start the guest following message appears:

"unable to execute QEMU command 'device_add': 'usb-host' is not a valid device model name"

Then the guest will not start.

I try it with different usb devices (iphone, stick, hdd), always the same error.

Are there any news / hints about this ?

Regards

Martin

Be sure to add the -usb option. What is your command line?

Hi,
 
From qemu-1.7 release version, the old usb-host(host-linux.c) had been removed, 
re-implemented by libusbx. So you should build qemu with --enable-libusb, then
you can use usb pass-through capacity.

BTW, Gerd, should we enable libusb by default now? Thanks.


Best regards,

Hi,

as far as I can see from the rpm specs of the opensuse rpm package the 
--enable-libusb is set .

The above error information shows "usb-host" didn't been built in qemu-system-x86_64
binary file. You can get the qemu-2.0.0 source files from http://wiki.qemu.org/Download
and rebuild it with '--enable-libusb' during configure.

By default libusb will be used when found on the system.
When it isn't there qemu will be built without usb-host support.

If you explicitly ask for libusb support (via --enable-libusb) and
libusbx isn't found configure should fail.

cheers,
  Gerd




Martin,

The OBS Virtualization/qemu project doesn't build  QEMU v2.0 with libusb support for openSUSE 13.1, because the version provided in that distro was 1.0.9, and QEMU's configure requires 1.0.13.

Bruce

Hi, I've done the following on my OpenSUSE 13.1 install where I'm in sore need of USB passthrough with QEMU 2.0.0
1) zypper source-install qemu to get the sources 
2) update of libusb to 1.0.18 from the hardware:/debug/OpenSUSE_Factory repo - packages are libusb-1_0-0 and libusb-1_0-devel
3) removed the version check for --enable-libusb in qemu.spec to ensure that this flag is set when building
The output of rpmbuild -bb /usr/src/packages/SPECS/qemu.spec is
error: Failed build dependencies:
        libusb-devel is needed by qemu-2.0.0-240.5.x86_64
        xen-devel is needed by qemu-2.0.0-240.5.x86_64
Any input is greatly appreciated.

xen-devel was not an issue (that package was installed so that dependency was resolved immediately) but libusb-devel is still reported as missing, even though I have a 1.0.18 version of a libusb-1_0-devel installed. I would think it's only the package name that is different. I'm not overly familiar with the build process, therefore I'm not certain if it would be sufficient to modify the qemu.spec build spec with the library name as it is installed on my system. Thanks.

I went ahead and modified the qemu.spec to require libusb-1_0-devel instead of libusb-devel. That seems to work as according to the build output it includes /usr/include/libusb-1.0. I apologize for needing three comments to get to this point. This is all very much a learning experience for me. 

It looks like something may be broken when building seabios.

Now I'm well and truly stuck. Is there a way to leave seabios out of the equation or can this be resolved?

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Hi,

the ticket can be close. All works fine with actual opensuse tumbleweed 
and qemu 2.10.0 :-)

Best regards

Martin
