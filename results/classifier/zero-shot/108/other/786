assert in qemu-6.2.0/hw/acpi/aml-build.c:61:build_append_padded_str: assertion failed: (len <= maxlen)
Description of problem:
assert and crash when -acpitable argument is used. Specifically, the argument was "-acpitable file=my_file.bin" which causes the assert and crash. 

The other arguments, I hope, are not critical. In brief, I'm using secure boot (with ovmf_code.secboot.fd), and a sw tpm as well. But hopefully these are not relevant.

The assert with -acpitable is a regression since it worked with version 6.1.0

The actual error message in qemu 6.2.0 is

qemu-6.2.0/hw/acpi/aml-build.c:61:build_append_padded_str: assertion failed: (len <= maxlen)
