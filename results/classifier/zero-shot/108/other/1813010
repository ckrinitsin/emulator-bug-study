It seems the --save-temps is what breaks things for me, the following works:

  ../qemu.git/configure --target-list=riscv64-softmmu --enable-debug --extra-cflags="-O0 -g3" && make -j9

rm -rf and start again with:

  ../qemu.git/configure --target-list=riscv64-softmmu --enable-debug --extra-cflags="-O0 -g3 --save-temps"

falls over with lines like:

  block/trace.h: In function ‘_nocheck__trace_nbd_co_request_fail’:
block/trace.h:3141:73: error: ‘_TRACE_NBD_CO_REQUEST_FAIL_DSTATE’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘TRACE_NBD_CO_REQUEST_FAIL_BACKEND_DSTATE’?
     if (trace_event_get_state(TRACE_NBD_CO_REQUEST_FAIL) && qemu_loglevel_mask(LOG_TRACE)) {
                                                                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                                                         TRACE_NBD_CO_REQUEST_FAIL_BACKEND_DSTATE

which implies something getting in the way of making the trace files.


it seems like that "-save-temps" in "cflags" is the culprit. I removed it and it was possible to build with 8 instances:

# removed "-save-temps" from the "cflags"
> ./qemu/configure --target-list=riscv64-softmmu --enable-debug --extra-cflags='-O0 -g3' --prefix=/install/riscv-qemu

# build without any problem
> make -j 8

A workaround for this is to use "-save-temps=obj" which ensures the temps are dumped in the object directory. I suspect there is a clash somewhere between what save temps dumps and some of the files we generate for tracing.

putting the temporary files in object dir works as well: -save-temps=obj

# "-save-temps=obj" from the "cflags"
> ./qemu/configure --target-list=riscv64-softmmu --enable-debug --extra-cflags='-O0 -g3 -save-temps=obj' --prefix=/install/riscv-qemu

# build again without any problem
> make -j 8 

Hi; I'm going to close this bug because there's no way that QEMU's build process can handle being passed -save-temps via --extra-cflags, because this will cause GCC to use the same output files for multiple different source files, and they will clash. (Even with a non-parallel build, one compile is going to win, and the temp files for the first compile of the pair will just be overwritten and lost.) 

As you've discovered, the right way to do this is to use -save-temps=obj, which will correctly put the temporary files in different places for each generated object file, so they don't conflict with each other.
