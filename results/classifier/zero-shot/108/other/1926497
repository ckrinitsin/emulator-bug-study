dp83932 stops working after a short while

Following the instructions here https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Platforms/m68k I was able to successfully install debian. However, running apt-get update stalls after the first 1-2MB.

root@debian:~# apt-get update
Get:1 http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports sid InRelease [55.3 kB]
Ign:1 http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports sid InRelease
Get:2 http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports sid/main all Packages [8,735 kB]
18% [2 Packages 2,155 kB/8,735 kB 25%]

After running apt-get update. I don't seem to be able to send any packets anymore. ping host lookups fail and a subsequent apt-get update makes no progress.

I'm launching qemu with:

  qemu-system-m68k -boot c \
 -M q800 -serial none -serial mon:stdio -m 1000M \
 -net nic,model=dp83932 -net user \
 -append "root=/dev/sda2 rw console=ttyS0 console=tty" \
 -kernel vmlinux-4.16.0-1-m68k \
 -initrd initrd.img-4.16.0-1-m68k \
 -drive file=m68k-deb10.qcow2,format=qcow2 \
 -nographic

I see this with qemu v6.0.0-rc5

I also see the same problem with version 4.2.1

I think you must use a more recent kernel because some bugs have been fixed in QEMU and kernel that need both of them in sync.

Could you extract the kernel from your m68k disk image to use it with QEMU "-kernel" and "-initrd" parameters?

The kernel in my m68k disk image is vmlinux-4.16.0-1-m68k which is presumably what comes from https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/10.0/m68k/iso-cd/debian-10.0-m68k-NETINST-1.iso. Is there a debian image that uses a newer kernel?

It looks like using https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/snapshots/2021-04-17/debian-10.0.0-m68k-NETINST-1.iso instead fixes the issue. Perhaps the instruction on https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Platforms/m68k should be updated.

I've updated the page to include:

Please note that the instructions below use kernel versions that might
have been superseded by newer ones on the most recent installation cd
images! Also, during installation on hard disk image the update
process might install a newer kernel. Always make sure to extract the
latest kernel and initrd.gz from your hard disk image after
installation or update and replace the kernel names in the examples
below with what is currently installed.


The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
