qemu/kvm SDL over ssh -X broken

qemu/kvm by default uses SDL to render the output of its emulated VGA graphics.
This is broken over ssh -X since quite a while.
The only workaround I know, is to use qemu -vnc :0
and connect using vncviewer


How To Reproduce:
1. zypper in qemu
2. ssh -X localhost qemu -cdrom ANYISOFILE

Actual Results:
qemu hangs in an endless loop on the BIOS display screen

Expected Results:
should boot up the iso as 0.10 versions did

Reproducible: Always


this is what broke it:

    sdl zooming

    Hi all,
    this patch implements zooming capabilities for the sdl interface.
    A new sdl_zoom_blit function is added that is able to scale and blit a
    portion of a surface into another.
    This way we can enable SDL_RESIZABLE and have a real_screen surface with
    a different size than the guest surface and let sdl_zoom_blit take care
    of the problem.

This problem occurs on both Debian and openSUSE.

One possible way to get X11-forwarding back on qemu master is to disable zoom by this patch.

But I do not know why the do_sdl_resize function should be problematic.
There is probably a better solution.

Hi,

I tried this with a current (git) build, and I'm not able to reproduce it.

I do see a problem with a bad initial SDL window size (its much too small) on a remote machine over a moderate-level network (wireless LAN). I don't see that when ssh-ing to localhost (even though both hosts are basically the same).

I do see differences between current (git) qemu and the 0.12.5 version. Current git boots the ISO, but doesn't appear to get to the login screen.

I'm not sure what the differences between our configurations are. I have SDL 1.2.14-6ubuntu3

Still investigation.

I now found that it depends on my client side. The bug happens when I ssh -XC from my netbook with 1024x600(intel)  to a server, but when I ssh -XC to the same server from my laptop with 1024x768(fbdev), then it works.
So might be that the scaling code that made the difference in my bisecting, is only used for small screens.

I can confirm this:

My client: 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS via ssh -X with Gnome - Terminal 3.4.1.1 and compiz enabled
3.2.0-33-generic #52-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 18 16:29:15 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU, with the latest version of SDL?

It seems to be working now with current versions, so has probably been fixed somewhere.

OK, thanks a lot for testing it again!
