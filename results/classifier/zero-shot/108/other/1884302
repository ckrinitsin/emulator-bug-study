disable automatic mouse grabbing

I'm using QEMU 5.0.0 on a Gentoo Linux host system. Guest is an Arch Linux system.

I'd like to disable automatic mouse grabbing when the QEMU window is focused.
I would prefer for QEMU to grab the mouse only after a click.

I use the i3 window manager on my host system.
Suppose I'm in workspace 1, while the QEMU window is in workspace 2.
In order to switch to workspace 2, I need to press the "Win+2" key combination ("Win" is the Windows key).
The problem is that the character "2" (from "Win+2") will get transferred to the guest system.
For example, if I have a text editor opened under the guest system, the character "2" will be pasted inside the document I'm working on, which is pretty annoying.

I would like instead to press the "Win+2" key combination and then explicitely click on the QEMU window with the mouse before grabbing it.

Command line:

qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=/home/fturco/qemu/arch.img,media=disk,index=0,if=virtio,format=raw,cache=none -cpu host -m 2G -k it -enable-kvm -net nic,model=virtio -net user -vga virtio -display sdl -usb -rtc base=utc -soundhw ac97 -monitor stdio -no-quit

Possibly similar bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/906864

FYI:  The gtk ui has support for that.  Try "-display gtk,grab-on-hover=off".  You can also toggle it in the "view" menu.

Thanks for the info, but I prefer to continue using the SDL interface, if possible.
Is there a plan to add the grab-on-hover=off option to the SDL interface?


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
