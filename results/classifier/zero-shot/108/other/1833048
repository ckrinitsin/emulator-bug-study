Guest Agent get-fsinfo doesn't show ZFS volumes

Calling get-fsinfo on a virtual machine does not include ZFS volumes. Calling on a system with a single ZFS disk (ZFS as root fs) simply returns '[]', if other disks exist on the guest it only shows these.

Expected behaviour: Show file system details like with other fs formats.

Tried with debian stretch default qemu-guest-agent package and v4.0.0 from git, compiled locally - result is the same.
Host is using QEMU 3.0.1, but that shouldn't matter, right?

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
