Use of TSTEQ/TSTNE has regressed the cdrom test when running a 32 bit build of qemu-system-x86_64 using TCG
Description of problem:
The test freezes, eventually timing out. The bisect was confused by other SEV related things so I had to whittle down the config to --disable-kvm.
Steps to reproduce:
1. '../../configure' '--disable-docs' '--disable-user' '--cross-prefix=i686-linux-gnu-' '--target-list=x86_64-softmmu' '--enable-debug' '--disable-kvm'
2. ninja
3. meson test -t 0.05 qtest-x86_64/cdrom-test V=1

    target/i386: use TSTEQ/TSTNE to test low bits
    
    When testing the sign bit or equality to zero of a partial register, it
    is useful to use a single TSTEQ or TSTNE operation.  It can also be used
    to test the parity flag, using bit 0 of the population count.
    
    Do not do this for target_ulong-sized values however; the optimizer would
    produce a comparison against zero anyway, and it avoids shifts by 64
    which are undefined behavior.
