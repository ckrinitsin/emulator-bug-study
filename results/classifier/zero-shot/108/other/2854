https://www.qemu.org/ is missing chance to provide (or at least link) some starting guide
Description of problem:
as a completely new (potential) user https://www.qemu.org/ main page is missing chance to easily link some hello world documentation
Steps to reproduce:
1. open https://www.qemu.org/
2. try to click "Full-system emulation" with hope that it will link some starting hello world how to do so
Additional information:
On https://www.qemu.org/ you can click "support"

Then you can click "documentation"

Then "main documentation section"

Then "system emulation"

Then "introduction"

At this point you have something that sort-of is viable as hello world.

Maybe link https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/introduction.html from main page ("Full-system emulation")?

Unless there is a better documentation?

Though maybe someone who will not go through this link maze should not try to use QEMU at all?
