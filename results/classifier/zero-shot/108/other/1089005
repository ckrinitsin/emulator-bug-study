Qemu does not shutdown with vnc enabled on OS X

I am running OS X 10.8.2 and Qemu 1.3.50 from your git repository.

Running

    qemu-system-i386 <image>

works fine. I can quit the process using ctrl-c.

When I try to use

     qemu-system-i386 -vnc :<port> <image>

ctrl-c does nothing and I have to kill the process trough the activity monitor.
Furthermore terminating the process from my java program does not work either. 
I have also posted a question on Stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13798367/qemu-does-not-shutdown-with-vnc-enabled-on-os-x

Thanks

Interesting -- my experience is that control-C doesn't work at all, even if using the cocoa UI frontend. It's a bug of some kind related to signal handling but I haven't been able to track it down. As far as I could tell with a debugger QEMU never received the SIGTERM at all, which makes no sense to me.

As a workaround you can send QEMU a SIGKILL, which will abruptly terminate QEMU (NB that if you have a writable disk image you may find it is corrupt since this is a long way from a clean shutdown). The best approach would be to make the guest cleanly power down the VM, which should cause QEMU to exit automatically.


Triaging old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce this issue with the
latest version of QEMU (version 2.9)?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

the issue is still there
i am using 2.9.50
i want to stop a running process when i press ctrl-c and not stop the whole qemu

Rida, this bug was about stopping QEMU with CTRL-c, so I guess you tried to do something else here? What do you mean by "running process"? The emulated process that is running with QEMU?

I just got the newest version of QEMU available via Homebrew (2.9.0) and was able to successfully terminate the QEMU process with ctrl-c. 

@Rida: To clarify: I did want to stop the whole QEMU and that did not work at the time. I had to kill the process through the activity monitor. 

Thanks for checking the latest version, Leander - I changed the status accordingly.
