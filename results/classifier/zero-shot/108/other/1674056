USB keyboard and mouse sucked into qemu-kvm (somewhere)

i am unable to run a command line qemu that does not "suck in" the keyboard and mouse of the host PC
i tried all that i could from the command line parameters i want to run a headless gui-less kvm host

if i specify a second set of keyboard and mouse with the -usb the only thing that is diffrent is that i have a keyboard and mouse in the VM if i specify the host keyboard and mouse same thing ... the vm is working fine but the host has no control , no keyboard. i dont see any output of anything 
the only recourse i have is ctrl+alt+delete  and that resets the host after 2-3 times. 

i tried ctrl+alt, ctrl+alt+x , c , z , 2 , etc... also alt + all those combination and alt with F keys 
no luck. 


my command line looks like this (altough i tried many other variations)
 
qemu-system-x86_64 -M q35 -enable-kvm \
-cpu host,kvm=off -m 4096 -smp cpu=4,sockets=1,cores=4,treads=1 \
-drive file=xyz.qcow2,if=scsi \
-device vfio-pci, ... (GPU) \
-device vfio-pci, .... (GPU audio) \
-usb -usbdevice host:XXXX:XXXX -usbdevice host:XXXX:XXXX \   <<< same behaviour with and without
-vga none -vnc localhost:1 -daemonize  

i tried with -nographics , -curses, -monitor stdio, pty and none, same result and with -serial as well
tried </dev/null at the end of the command no luck same with & 

my guess is that the keyboard and mouse gets grabbed by the "window" of the qemu regardless if there is graphics or not and i have not foud a "-headless" ,"-nograb" or "-nopussygrab" mode . (yeah had to make the joke :P)

hardware:
Z97N-wifi 
Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4690K CPU @ 3.50GHz
ram > 8Gb
keyboard is logitech
mouse is logitech

distro is suse leap 42.1 (made with suseStudio)

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
