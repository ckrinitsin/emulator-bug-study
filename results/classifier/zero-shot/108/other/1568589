fix: http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/603499/

According to the discussion for the patch that you've mentioned, the problem should go away after a "make distclean". Can you still reproduce it after doing a fresh build?

Closing this bug since the submitter never responded to Thomas' query in comment #4 in 2016, and we believe it to have been a transient issue fixed by 'make distclean'.
