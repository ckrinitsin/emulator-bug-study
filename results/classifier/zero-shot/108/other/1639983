e1000 EEPROM have bad checksum

I am using qemu-system-i386 to emulate FreeDOS with e1000 nic card.

I am using Intel PRODOS v.19.0 (latest version with E1000ODI.COM file).
E1000ODI.COM v.5.07 (140116)

http://pclosmag.com/html/issues/201208/page11.html
Suggest that v.4.75 (120212) was/is working.
Oldest PRODOS available version seems now 18.5 (June 2013) which I have not tested yet.

When running it, it detect: Slot 18, IRQ 11, Port C000.

But complains:
EEPROM checksum was incorrect.

Contact your services network supplier for a replacement.

I'm also seeing this issue with version 2.11. Currently Intel's oldest available is 18.4 and this version reports an invalid checksum. The E1000.dos file when loaded doesn't recognize the emulated NIC. 

I was able to get the e1000odi DOS driver to correctly detect the Intel e1000e once I added a PCIe bus, however the e1000 still reports a bad checksum as of this posting with the master branch.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
