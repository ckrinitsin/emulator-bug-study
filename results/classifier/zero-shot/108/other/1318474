QEMU update causes Windows reactivation

After updating QEMU the guest OS's detect new hardware. As a result any Windows OS sees it as a significant change in hardware and require a reactivation.

Host OS: Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit

Guest OS's:
Windows Server 2003 R2 Enterprise
Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise
Windows Server 2008 R2 Web
Windows Server 2008 R2 Data Center

QEMU version: 2.0.0

How did you start QEMU with the new version here? You might need to specify the correct machine type with the new version to avoid that the guest sees different hardware (e.g. with the "-machine pc-i440fx-2.0" option).

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

When updating QEMU use specific machine type and this will keep "old" HW.
