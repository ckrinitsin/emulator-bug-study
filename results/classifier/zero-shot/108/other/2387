Segmentation fault on booting from ISO when using GTK display with OpenGL enabled
Description of problem:
When trying to boot from the ISO mounted in the `-cdrom` argument, using a GTK display with OpenGL enabled gives a segmentation fault error. If using SDL instead, the whole application kinda freezes most of the times. I managed to get it working once, but I don't know how or why, seemed completely random. After installing it, I can boot from the disk normally with no errors.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install QEMU for MSYS2 / UCRT64 as described [here](https://www.qemu.org/download/#windows)
2. Download ISO from EndeavourOS website
3. Run `qemu-img create -f qcow2 EndeavourOS.qcow2 64G` to create a disk file
4. Run the script as described above in a `.sh` file
5. See error
Additional information:
I have multiple VMs, included but not limited to Manjaro, Pop!\_OS and Debian, none of them gives this specific error. I also usually avoid SDL because I had multiple issues with the application window completely freezing in the past with "Not responding", and that does not happen with GTK.
