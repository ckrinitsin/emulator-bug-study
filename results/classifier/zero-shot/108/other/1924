```

If we do vcpu hotplug and hot unplug for virtual machine continuously, the virtual memory and RES memory of qemu is increasing.
Steps to reproduce:
1. start qemuï¼š
valgrind   --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full /home/qemu-system-x86_64  -accel kvm -cpu host -m 4G -smp 4,maxcpus=64,sockets=8,dies=1,cores=8,threads=1  -drive file=/home/centosx861.qcow2,if=none,id=drive0,cache=none  -device virtio-blk,drive=drive0,bootindex=1  -monitor stdio -vnc :0
2. after boot successful
ctl+c kill qemu
