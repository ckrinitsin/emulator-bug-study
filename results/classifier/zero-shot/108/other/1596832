e500 -bios/-kernel broken with big images

This is tested using qemu 2.4.1, but it looks like the code qemu/hw/ppc/e500.c has not changed since. This looks like the source of the problem:  http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=3812c71ffaa2cf733c3087792b859fef30b7545f


What works:
----------

Basic invocation qemu-system-ppc -machine ppce500  -monitor stdio  -bios u-boot.e500 works, I get the uboot prompt and this:

(qemu) info roms
addr=0000000000f00000 size=0x044b8c mem=ram name="phdr #0: .../qemu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"
addr=0000000000f81000 size=0x006b00 mem=ram name="phdr #1: .../qemu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"


Passing u-boot.e500 image as kernel (-bios u-boot.e500 -kernel u-boot.e500) appears to work, $qemu_kernel_addr is filled in, though (as expected) uboot complains about the image format.

(qemu) info roms
addr=0000000000f00000 size=0x044b8c mem=ram name="phdr #0: .../qemu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"
addr=0000000000f81000 size=0x006b00 mem=ram name="phdr #1: .../qemu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"
addr=0000000002000000 size=0x054e8c mem=ram name=".../qemu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500



What doesn't work:
-----------------

However, once I try to load a big image (>=32 MiB), uboot doesn't even show anything:

qemu-system-ppc -machine ppce500  -monitor stdio -bios u-boot.e500 -kernel boot/vmlinux -m 1024

(qemu) info roms
addr=0000000000f00000 size=0x044b8c mem=ram name="phdr #0: .../qemu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"
addr=0000000000f81000 size=0x006b00 mem=ram name="phdr #1: .../qemu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"
addr=0000000002000000 size=0x27aeedc mem=ram name="boot/vmlinux"

The thing is, this used to work +- before the commit, where I'd just pass the image as -kernel option, and it booted.


If I do that now (w/o the -bios option, using the exact same image), the kernel gets loaded twice, only at different addresses (the cause is obvious from the commit), causing overlap error:

qemu-system-ppc -machine ppce500  -monitor stdio  -kernel boot/vmlinux -m 1024
QEMU 2.4.1 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) rom: requested regions overlap (rom boot/vmlinux. free=0x00000000027492fc, addr=0x0000000002000000)

Curious: Is your guest kernel >=3.6 with qemu-ppce500 config ie qemu_ppce500 defined etc? 
In case u-boot loads/maps uImage format kernel differently have you tried uImage vs vmlinux?

And are you able to boot ok with an mpc... machine instead of ppce500 by specifying a dtb file or dtb compatibility? Do you know if more recent qemu (2.8 or 3 or 4.2) has same issue for you?

Oh wow I just noticed this is from 2016! It would be nice for such bugs to have follow-up, closure, or summary of solution/circumvention/workaround taken by those who posted them :)

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
