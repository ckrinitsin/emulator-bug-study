Avoid defining custom machine-definition macros for each new machine type
Additional information:
There are already some semi-generic implementations of this macro, such as [`DEFINE_PC_VER_MACHINE()`](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/aa3a285b5bc56a4208b3b57d4a55291e9c260107/include/hw/i386/pc.h#L326), which is used for the 'q35', 'pc' and 'isapc' machine types. 

There does appear to be some deviation from the template macro in some cases. We would have to enumerate what the nature of these deviations is, why only some machine types need them, and how they would fit into the proposed generic macro. Still, if we could have a generic macro that simplifies 80% of machine types' version definitions, then that seems like a win.
