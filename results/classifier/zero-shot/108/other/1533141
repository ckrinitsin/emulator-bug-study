qemu/disas/libvixl/vixl/invalset.h: 2 * sanity check after use ?

1.

[qemu/disas/libvixl/vixl/invalset.h:442]: (style) Array index 'low' is used before limits check.

 while (!IsValid(elements[low]) && (low < high)) ++low;

2.

[qemu/disas/libvixl/vixl/invalset.h:450]: (style) Array index 'middle' is used before limits check.

  while (!IsValid(elements[middle]) && (middle < high - 1)) ++middle;

Also, binary search is a standard C library routine. Suggest use.

libvixl is not part of QEMU proper, but is an upstream library which we use (as documented in disas/libvixl/README). If you want to suggest coding style changes to it I would recommend reporting them to the upstream project:  https://github.com/armvixl/vixl .

QEMU just takes the most recent release of the library and includes it in our repo without making any changes to the code if we can avoid it.
