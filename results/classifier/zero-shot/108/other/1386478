PS/2 keyboard returns incorrect scan code for F7 to guest

Using qemu 2.1 as supplied in Debian jessie, the F7 scan code (scan set 2) is being returned by qemu to the guest as 0x02, and not the correct value of 0x83.  (I assume 0x83 is correct, given that I cannot locate any scan set 2 charts that use any other value for F7.  Including those published by Microsoft.)

I see the map in hw/input/ps2.c ps2_raw_keycode[] using the correct values, starting at F1:  5, 6, 4, 12 (0x0C). 3. 11 (0x0B), 2, 10 (0x0A), 1, 9, ... but nowhere in that map do I see 131 (0x83).

I think this has been fixed by:
https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=8c10e0baf0260b5
... so closing this ticket now. If you still have trouble, please re-open it.
