Incorrect display colors when running big endian guest on POWER8 little endian host

When running a big endian CentOS guest on a little endian host system the display shows severe color issues, probably due to endianness not being properly detected / switched in the emulated display hardware.  Little endian guests show no display issues on the same host hardware and software.

See attachment for an example of the problem.



Which version of QEMU are you using? How did you start QEMU (i.e. which kind of graphics card did you specify)? And which version of CentOS are you using for the guest?

IIRC there were some endianess fixes for this in the past ... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU and a recent kernel? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
