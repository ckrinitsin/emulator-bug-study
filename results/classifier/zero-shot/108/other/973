qemu 6.2 memory leak when failed to boot and infinitely reboot
Description of problem:
qemu allocates tons of memory (very likely memory leak) in certain (rare) cases.

When I misconfigured qemu so that I have run a bigger linux kernel within insufficient memory (for example 8M bzImage while 16M ram and no hdd), the kernel will obviously fail to boot. In this case qemu will reboot (likely the linux kernel reboots). However reboot does not solve the problem, causing qemu to repeatedly reboot.

Memory usage of qemu raises sharply in the progress.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Get any linux kernel (tested with 5.15.33)
2. Run the kernel on qemu, with memory smaller than necessary
Additional information:
A reproducing dockerfile:
```
FROM alpine:3.15

RUN apk add qemu-system-x86_64 linux-virt

CMD ["/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64", "-kernel", "/boot/vmlinuz-virt", "-nographic", "-net", "none", "-m", "16M"]
```
