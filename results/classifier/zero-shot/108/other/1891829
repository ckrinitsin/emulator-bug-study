High bit(s) sometimes set high on rcvd serial bytes when char size < 8 bits

I *believe* (not confirmed) that the old standard PC serial ports, when configured with a character size of 7 bits or less, should set non-data bits to 0 when the CPU reads received chars from the read register.  qemu doesn't do this.

Windows 1.01 will not make use of a serial mouse when bit 7 is 1.  The ID byte that the mouse sends on reset is ignored.  I added a temporary hack to set bit 7 to 0 on all incoming bytes, and this convinced windows 1.01 to use the mouse.

note 1:  This was using a real serial mouse through a passed-through serial port.  The emulated msmouse doesn't work for other reasons.

note 2:  The USB serial port I am passing through to the guest sets non-data bits to 1.  Not sure if this is the USB hardware or linux.

note 3:  I also needed to add an -icount line to slow down the guest CPU, so that certain cpu-sensitive timing code in the guest didn't give up too quickly.

I will hopefully submit a patch for review soon.


If I connect a serial mouse to the built-in serial port on an old (kernel 2.4) box and go

stty -F /dev/ttyS0 1200 cs7
dd if=/dev/ttyS0 bs=1|hexdump -C

The bytes received/printed when the mouse is moved all have bit7=0.


The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
