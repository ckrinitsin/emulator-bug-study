moving window + changing screen resolution = bug

Steps to reproduce:
1. Run qemu (sdl)
2. Start moving the window
3. At that moment the virtualized OS should change its screen resolution (for example, when switching from initial qemu screen to grub)

What I see:
Window size doesn't change, but internal screen resolution changes, so, image scale stops to be 1:1, now I see virtualized OS in wrong scale.

What I expected to see:
Window size changes so, that it keeps synchronized with internal resolution (as usual)

This bug preserves at lastest git version at the moment, i. e. 3d30395f7fb3315e4ecf0de4e48790e1326bbd47

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU, using SDL2? Or could we close this ticket nowadays? In case the problem persists, please also specify which host system (Linux? Window manager? Or Windows?) you are using!

The bug is not present in Qemu 2.12 (version reported by dpkg: qemu-system-x86 1:2.12+dfsg-1+b1). There is similar minor bug instead. The new bug doesn't harm me and I am not even sure is this a bug.

So, this is info about new minor bug.

Host is Debian Sid installed today (23 May MSK) with mentioned Qemu 2.12. I run Qemu in X using:

# qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 -daemonize -snapshot -drive file=/dev/sda,format=raw,cache=none -kernel /boot/vmlinuz* -initrd /boot/initrd* -append root=/dev/sda

Then I started to move Qemu window using mouse. I kept Qemu window catched by my mouse while guest OS boot. At some moment guest OS (Linux) switched from text mode to framebuffer. Internal screen resolution changed, but Qemu window didn't change its size (I kept moving Qemu window all this time), but likely window content didn't scale (this is as opposed to 3d30395f [3d30395f7fb3315e4ecf0de4e48790e1326bbd47] behavior, 3d30395f scaled window content). So text in window remain concrete (not fluid, as opposed to 3d30395f). Then I tried to resize Qemu window and window size imidiately became normal, i. e. it started to fit content.

All this is acceptable for me. I. e. I see this is nothing wrong when Qemu cannot change its window size when I move Qemu window
