GTK display does not support host scale factor

In the GNOME desktop environment, for HiDPI displays there is support to upscale everything.

This can be set in "System Settings -> Displays -> Scale".

I believe this affects GDK in the same way as setting the "GDK_SCALE" environment variable does.

When launching `qemu-system-x86_64 ... -display gtk`, this scale factor seems to get lost; the result is that the host window is upscaled and doubled in size, while the guest appears only in the bottom left corner of the UI.



The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
