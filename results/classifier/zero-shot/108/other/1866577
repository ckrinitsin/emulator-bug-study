powerpc-none-eabi-gdb.exe GDB 9.1 with QEMU 4.2 gdb-stub comes with  Reply contains invalid hex digit 79

I am using powerpc-none-eabi-gdb with qemu 4.2, but it comes with 
the following error:

undefinedC:\CI-Tools\msys64\powerpc-none-eabi\usr\local\bin\powerpc-none-eabi-gdb.exe: warning: Couldn't determine a path for the index cache directory.

```Not implemented stop reason (assuming exception): undefined```
The target architecture is assumed to be powerpc:603

```
Reply contains invalid hex digit 79
```

Which parameters do you use to run QEMU?
