qemu system emulator fails to start if no sound card is present on host

A plain build from git master at 81dbcfa9e1d8bab3f7c4cc923c0b40cd666f374f on Fedora 29 x86_64 host, with no options passed to configure.

Trying to launch QEMU on a  host with no audio card present:

# ls /dev/snd/
seq  timer

It will fail to initialize alsa and abort startup:

# qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-29-1.2.iso  -m 4000 -vnc 0.0.0.0:1

    audio: probe audio drivers by default
    
    Add the drivers listed in audio_possible_drivers to audio_drv_list,
    using the try-* variants.  That way the probable drivers are compiled by
    default if possible.
    
    Additioal tweaks:
      linux: reorder to: pa alsa sdl oss.
      *bsd: drop pa.

This changed our probe order:

   Linux)
  -  audio_drv_list="oss"
  +  audio_drv_list="try-pa try-alsa try-sdl oss"

After some debugging I can see that 'audio_init' successfully initializes the alsa driver.

When the pcspk devices goes to AUD_open_out though, the alsa driver fails spewing the above text to stderr and thus causes QEMU to fail.

This looks very much like the ALSA driver in QEMU is broken - audio_init() should not have succeeded unless the ALSA driver knew it could later succesfully honour AUD_open_out.

Don't know if same but just noticed "no sound" unless I unplug and replug headphones. If I boot with no headphones plugged in I get no sound, but if I plug in headphones I get sound. Of course, then, if I unplug headphones I still get sound. Something about plugging/unplugging to the headphones jack wakes things up.

Kris, your situation is completely different.

I agree. Thanks. :)

What happens if you remove "try-alsa" from the configure line?

I would work around this issue
by applying "export QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=none" to shell before we run the qemu command.


This bug was fixed by commit 7183834a29fbaf422a6 which will be in 4.0.
