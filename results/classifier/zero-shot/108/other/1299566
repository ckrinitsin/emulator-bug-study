virtio serial doesn't work with virtio nic

If virtio NIC is not used virtserialport works and delivers data written to /dev/vport0p1 to localhost:4444:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -kernel mykernel -initrd myramdisk -device virtio-serial -chardev socket,host=localhost,port=4444,id=agent -device virtserialport,chardev=agent,name=hera.agent -net user -net nic

If using virtio nic, write to /dev/vport0p1 succeeds, but no data is delivered to localhost:4444:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -kernel mykernel -initrd myramdisk -device virtio-serial -chardev socket,host=localhost,port=4444,id=agent -device virtserialport,chardev=agent,name=hera.agent -net user -net nic,model=virtio

This bug exists in 2.0 release, Debian's QEMU 1.7 package and b3706faf from git.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

I can't reproduce it now, I don't even remember this issue.

Ok, thanks for your answer. Then let's assume that it has been fixed by one of the past releases.
