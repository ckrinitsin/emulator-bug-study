unable to read symlinks when mounting 9p filesystem with security_model=mapped

I am trying to use clang that is mounted from a 9p filesystem that has the options 
 -fsdev local,id=virtfs3,path=/clang,security_model=mapped-file -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=virtfs3,mount_tag=clang

clang has symlinks to clang-9. eg /clang/clang/bin/clang is a symlink that points to clang-9 in the current directory. 

the clang filesystem is on a bind mount point on /clang/clang on the host and this is mapped to the same place on the guest. If I have the same virtfs mount point with the security_model=none I don't have this problem.

On the host: readlink clang
clang-9

and guest:

ls: cannot read symbolic link 'clang': No such file or directory
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 May 30 02:21 clang

readlink clang

returns nothing.
