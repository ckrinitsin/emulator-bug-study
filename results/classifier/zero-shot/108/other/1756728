virtio-scsi virtio-scsi-single and virtio-blk on raw image, games are not starting

Using virtio-scsi / vitro-scsi-sing and vitro-blk on a ZFS/raw image, most Assassin's Creed (Origin especially) games are not starting (uPlay), it seems related to some check or commands applications are doing on the disk drive that fails to respond.

Workaround has been found by creating a VHD volume, mounting it and installing games on it.

On a side note, application like HDDScan, CrystalDiskInfo returns nothing regarding disk drives.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
