qemu 4.2 does not process discard(trim) commands 

I'm using Arch Linux with qemu 4.2 and blktrace to monitor discard commands as they are sent to the hardware.  Blktrace shows nothing as the VM is trimming the SSDs.

I downgraded to qemu 4.1.1 and blktrace shows lots of discard commands as the VM is trimming.

Kernel version is 5.5.4.

Attached is the libvirt xml.





How did you start QEMU? Does this still happen with the latest version of QEMU?

I mean: Please provide the QEMU command line parameters ... is this also reproducible without libvirt? ... otherwise it might also be a problem in libvirt instead...

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
