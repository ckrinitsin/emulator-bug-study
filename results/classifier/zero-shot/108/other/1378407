[feature request] Partition table wrapper for single-filesystem images

Suppose you have a single filesystem image. It would be nice if QEMU could generate a virtual partition table for it and make it available to the guest as a partitioned disk. Otherwise you have to use workarounds like this: wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/QEMU#Simulate_virtual_disk_with_MBR_using_linear_RAID

It should be relatively easy to do on top of existing vvfat code.

This is a rather specific use case.  Note that linux can use partitionless diskspace just fine, and depending on the bootmanager, one can use single partition as a virtual disk to boot linux too (syslinux supports this mode for one).  Implementing this feature in qemu does not make much sense to me, unless it is a generic block device remapper like dm in kernel, which is rather complex.  FWIW.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
