nvme is missing support for NVME_ADM_CMD_ASYNC_EV_REQ

NVME_ADM_CMD_ASYNC_EV_REQ is required by specification but apparently we will be responded by error when this command is used.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

This was fixed in 5.2.0.
