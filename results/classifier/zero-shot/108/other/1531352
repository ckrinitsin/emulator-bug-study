QEMU_LD_PREFIX not load correct library order in the PATH

run qemu with QEMU_LD_PREFIX argument will not load the library in the PATH.
Ex: I use debootstrap to download the library of i386 architecture
And use -L point to the path.
But not load the library from that directory.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
