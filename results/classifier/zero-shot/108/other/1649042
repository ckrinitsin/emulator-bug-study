Ubuntu 16.04.1 LightDM Resolution Not Correct

My Specs:

Slackware 14.2 x86_64 > Host
Nvidia GPU GTX660M
nvidia-driver-352.63
QEMU 2.7.0

Ubuntu 16.04.1 x86_64 > Guest
Unity
Xorg nouveau - 1:1.0.12-1build2

These are the startup options for Ubuntu:

qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=ubuntu.img \
-cpu host \
--enable-kvm \
-smp 2 \
-m 4096 \
-vga vmware \
-soundhw ac97 \
-usbdevice tablet \
-rtc base=localtime \
-usbdevice host:0781:5575

Unity desktop resolution set for 1440x900.

I noticed when I come to the login screen to enter my password the LightDM resolution fills my entire desktop.

I searched online and found this solution;

cp ~/.config/monitor.xml /var/lib/lightdm/.config

For now I'm assuming this step should not be needed and the resolution should be correctly detected and set?

Why are you using "-vga vmware" ? Can't you use "-vga std" instead? Also, now that QEMU 2.8 has been released, could you please test again with this latest version? Thanks!

Hi I'll just post to here for both issues;

Using virtio it works nice....

OK, if it works with -vga virtio, I think we should close this bug as WONTFIX, since the -vga vmware code is pretty much unmaintained as far as I know (if somebody is willing to fix this there, too, feel free to open this bug again).
