The behavior you are showing here is explained as follows:

Backing file paths can be relative or absolute and are stored inside
the image file.  In this case you are providing a relative backing
file path.

Relative backing file paths are interpreted against the image filename.
In other words:

  join_path(dirname('a/ovl.img'), 'a/blob.img') -> 'a/a/blob.img'

The problem was:
> qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b a/blob.img a/ovl.img

If you want to use a relative backing file path, remember that it is
relative to the image file:

cd a && qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b blob.img ovl.img

Then 'qemu-img commit a/ovl.img' will work as expected.
