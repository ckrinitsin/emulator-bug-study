Can't convert to vmdk with the streamOptimized subformat

Hi all,
I'm trying to convert a qcow2 image file to the vmdk (on Ubuntu Server 12.04):

# qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O vmdk -o Stream spv-2912.qcow2 spv-2912-3.vmdk -o subformat=streamOptimized
VMDK: can't write to allocated cluster for streamOptimized
qemu-img: error while writing sector 65: Input/output error

Same result with any input format. Others subformats work but the StreamOptimized it is by far the most important one. The only workaround I found is to migrate to raw and then to use VBoxManage (VirtualBox).

Thanks for reporting this bug.  While the error looks different, I assume it is related to the same general lack of support as bug 905095 (and https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=548723)

Actually, using the same options as you do I do not get a failure.

Can you show the result of 

qemu-img info spv-2912.qcow2

Hi Serge,
the bug was confirmed by Stefan Hajnoczi[1] and still in QEMU 1.1:

"Unfortunately there has not been a fix.  The cause of the bug is known
and described in the email thread you linked.  If someone has time to
write a fix and test it, it could be merged.  It won't be possible for
QEMU 1.1 since the release is imminent."

Thanks, Sebastien.

With the latest codebase there is no error message but the converted streamOptimized image is incorrect.  I have a patch for this and will submit it for review soon.

My patch has landed: https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/3efffc3292d94271a15b1606b4a56adf6c6f04ed

I think we can resolve this bug as fixed.   Just one note for those how are trying to use streamOptimized images with VMware: you need to patch the VMDK version because VMware products accept only version 3 for streamOptimized:

# Set VMDK version 3 for foo.vmdk
$ printf '\x03' | dd conv=notrunc of=foo.vmdk bs=1 seek=$((0x4))



This bug was fixed in the package qemu - 1:2.3+dfsg-5ubuntu6

---------------
qemu (1:2.3+dfsg-5ubuntu6) wily; urgency=medium

  * Make qemu-system-common and qemu-utils depend on qemu-block-extra
    to fix errors with missing block backends. (LP: #1495895)
  * Cherry pick fixes for vmdk stream-optimized subformat (LP: #1006655)
  * Apply fix for memory corruption during live-migration in tcg mode
    (LP: #1493049)
  * Apply tracing patch to remove use of custom vtable in newer glibc
    (LP: #1491972)

I'm confused- this is marked as affecting qemu-kvm in precise, but the
preceding patch (c6ac36e) which introduced the bug is not there either.
So I'm going to mark this as not affecting precise unless someone speaks
up to say that we in fact need the whole dependent series.


I have tried, many times, to use qemu-img to create StreamOptimized for VMWare ESXi 6.0 OVAs.

It does NOT work.

After days of research, I replaced qemu-img, by vboxmanage, then, it worked!

Now, I'm using something this:

--
vboxmanage convertfromraw packer/output-vm.raw packer/output-vm-disk1.vmdk --format vmdk --variant Stream
--

I also had to edit the headers, with dd:

---
dd if=output-vm-disk1.vmdk of=output-vm-disk1.descriptor bs=1 skip=512 count=1024
sed -i -e 's/ide/lsilogic/g' output-vm-disk1.descriptor
dd conv=notrunc,nocreat if=output-vm-disk1.descriptor of=output-disk1.vmdk bs=1 seek=512 count=1024
---

This is the only way to build StreamOptimized VMDKs, for inclusion inside of OVA, that works on VMWare 6.0.

The qemu-img can not be used.

Here is my full solution to this problem (if the same problem):

https://github.com/tmartinx/svauto/blob/dev/image-factory.sh#L510

I'm just not entirely sure if we're talking about the same problem here...

Cheers!
Thiago

It looks like my problem is different, since I'm not seeing this:

qemu-img: error while writing sector 65: Input/output error

But maybe, it is a light in the end of the tunnel...

Patch 3efffc3292d9427 had been released with QEMU 2.5
