Add support for the 1366x768  resolution to the -vga std output
Additional information:
There is a Debian [issue](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=700055) about it back from 2013. The is also a 2024 thread [thread](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-discuss/2024-07/msg00003.html) about it on the `qemu-user` mailing list.

I failed to make it a feature reqeust by keeping the template text  
`/label ~"kind::Feature Request"`  
at the end of the message: *Gitlab* removes it automatically.
