PCI devices on PCI to PCI bridges stopped being accessable from Xen with QEMU 2.3.0

    Xen: Use the ioreq-server API when available
...

Added calls to xen_map_pcidev()  when available.  However these call are only done at startup, not when the guest configures the PCI to PCI bridge.  So Xen 4.5.0 (which has these) using a QEMU 2.3.0 or later can no longer access PCI devices that are not on a root bridge.

Since Xen's tool stack does not know about PCI to PCI bridges, a config that shows this issue also requires the correct Linux kernel argument "pci=assign-busses" is used.



Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
