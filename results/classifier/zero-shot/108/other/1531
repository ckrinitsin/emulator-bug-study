MIPSr6+MSA emulation is broken in QEMU 6.2.0 (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) and 7.0.0
Description of problem:
Many tests (8,11,12,13,15,19,23,30,31,36) are failing due to QEMU emulation problem.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download the source code from https://github.com/VectorChief/UniSIMD-assembler (master or v1.1.0c)
2. Change to project's test directory and build the binary for MIPS using cross-compiler (see simd_make_m64.mk)
3. Run the binary with QEMU linux-user mode: qemu-mips64el -cpu I6400 simd_test.m64f32Lr6 -c 1 | tee qemu64
4. Check the output text file qemu64 (with pluma or any other text editor) to see the error printouts
Additional information:
The pre-built binary and its output file are attached as test.tar.gz
[test.tar.gz](/uploads/7a54ba10919a1b221dd8ea0e8c02c064/test.tar.gz)

Please note, that standalone cross-compiler for MIPS downloaded from the site
(Codescape.GNU.Tools.Package.2020.06-01.for.MIPS.MTI.Linux.CentOS-6.x86_64.tar.gz)
comes with its own version of QEMU 4.1.0 which masks the system's QEMU when added to the PATH.
