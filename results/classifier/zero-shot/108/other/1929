regression: 7.0.0 breaks registering process subreaper on Apple silicon
Description of problem:
When running any container on the QEMU virtual guest that is using a utility like `tini` which is trying to register itself as a process subreaper I get an error message like this:

```
[FATAL tini (1)] PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER is unavailable on this platform. Are you using Linux >= 3.4?
```

The issue has been observed by multiple people on Apple silicon Macs, e.g. in these issues:
https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6620#issuecomment-1694380189
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator/issues/1735
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install QEMU 7.0.0+ on an Apple silicon MAC
2. Run a virtual guest
3. Try to register a process subreaper, e.g. like `tini -s` does
Additional information:
the issue was introduced in QEMU 7.0.0 with this commit:
