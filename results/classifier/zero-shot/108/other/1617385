No snapshot possible with virtio-gpu activated

I'm using "Qemu" and "Virtual Machine Manager" on Debian-8-Stretch - both newest versions out of the Debian-testing-repository (state 26.08.2016).

If I try to save a virtual machine, it fails and I'll get the following error:

libvirtError: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command 'migrate': State blocked by non-migratable device '0000:00:02.0/virtio-gpu'

This only happens, if I chose "Virtio" as graphics-driver (no matter if I use "Spice" or "Vnc" as Server by the way). If I switch to any other driver (Cirrus, Qxl, Vga, VMvga...) there is no problem to take a snapshot and save the virtual machine.

Unfortunately "virtio-gpu" (together with "Spice-Server") is the only driver that provides proper working/running my virtual machines on my PC.

Hi
  You should find in current qemu that virtio-gpu migrates unless you've enabled the virgl 3d graphics
code.    WHat version of the qemu package are you using?  If it's old then I suggest you open a debian
bug against it.

Hello,

I'm using Qemu-version "1:2.6+dfsg-3" together with virt-manager-version 
"1:1.4.0-3: all", as I've written, out of the regular 
Debian-testing-repository (Stretch)...

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

I also have this problem, with the 3D acceleration enabled, it would be great if the situation improves as the VM often not stable after the host restores from sleep state.

This bug tracker here is not active anymore. If you want to report bugs, please open a new ticket at https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues , thanks.
