add next free device option to qemu-img

I'd like to propose an option to be added to qemu-img which returns the next free NBD (the device file) very similar to losetup -f. It would make life a lot easier.

Followers of this enhancement request might be interested in the following workaround: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22535222/next-free-device-option-for-qemu-nbd/

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
