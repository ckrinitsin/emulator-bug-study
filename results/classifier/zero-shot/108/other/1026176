unable to boot squashfs through mtd device

Hi,

I have built latest qemu archive qemu-1.1.1 to be sure of up to date source code.
I have then built buildroot squashfs image, which can be used correctly with cmdline like:

qemu-system-i386 -m 64 -k fr -boot c -kernel images/bzImage -drive if=ide,file=images/rootfs.squashfs  -append "root=/dev/sda"

Then I wanted to modify cmdline to use real MTD device, like:

qemu-system-i386 -m 64 -k fr -boot c -kernel images/bzImage -drive if=mtd,file=images/rootfs.squashfs  -append "root=/dev/mtdblock0".

But nothing was good under kernel.
Even if mtd0 is reported through qemu interface (Ctrl Alt+2), no device can be found under kernel even if all drivers are built to use it.

Is this feature okay on qemu-1.1.1 ??
did I do mistake in my cmdline??

thank you for your help.
regards,

Triaging old bug tickets... QEMU 1.1 is pretty much outdated, can we close this bug nowadays? Can you still reproduce the issue with the latest version of QEMU?
