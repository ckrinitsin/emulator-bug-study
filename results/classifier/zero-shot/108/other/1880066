This did not happen in Eoan (qemu 4.0.0). I was able to switch in/out of a VM with my audio coming through fine. I enabled Eoan in my sources.list, downgraded all my qemu packages, and the issue was resolved.

This happens on the latest Windows 10 guest when a sound device is listening for the microphone.

/var/log/libvirt/qemu/<vmname>.log spews this error out when I switch with evdev (which is just the keyboard and mouse, the audio is passed through I assume spice):

I have this exact issue with any VM using Spice audio redirection.
My setup has Linux (Fedora 32) as host and guest.
The Guest microphone freezes mid way through most video conferences, which is quite a pain.
I see the exact same error messages:

A bug was just triggered in audio_get_avail
Context:
audio: live=172895567 sw->hw->conv_buf->size=1920
A bug was just triggered in audio_pcm_hw_get_live_in
Context:
audio: live=172895567 hw->conv_buf->size=1920

Closing the spice client (Boxes or Virtmanager) and reconnecting sometimes restores microphone.
I have tried AC97 and HD Audio as virtual hardware and have the same results, AC97 may be proving to be a little less failure prone, but I have not had enough events to be sure.


I upgraded to Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy Gorilla) and the issue was resolved.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days (otherwise it will get
closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate the ticket auto-
matically to the new system.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


Was fixed when moving to QEMU 5.x in Ubuntu 20.10.
