It is right

#halt

Excellent. Try next.

#rm -f file*
#/usr/local/bin/qemu -serial file:file1 -serial file:file2 -serial 
file:file3 -serial none hd.img
isa irq 4 already assigned

Misfire. Try next.

#/usr/local/bin/qemu -serial none -serial none -serial file:file3 
-serial file:file4 hd.img

In VM

#echo test1 >/dev/ttyS0
#echo test2 >/dev/ttyS1
#echo test3 >/dev/ttyS2

#echo test4 >/dev/ttyS3
... error...

OOPS! Surprise.

#halt

#ls -l file*
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7 2010-09-17 10:40 file3
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  7 2010-09-17 10:40 file4

In this case expected.


The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
