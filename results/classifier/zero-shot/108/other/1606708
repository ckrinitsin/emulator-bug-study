QEMU crashes when switching consoles using SDL

I've trying to use QEMU with SDL, and I noticed that it doesn't behave well, specially when switching from VGA to any console. Resuming, switching is erratic when using SDL, and its effects go from creating a new window, doing nothing, showing a window that disappears inmediately or even crash.

Tested with:
Arch Linux with all packages updated (2016/7/26)
TWM as window manager
QEMU (both stable 2.6.0-1 and latest git commit f49ee63)
Command: qemu-system-x86_64 -display sdl

sdl2 version 2.0.4-2

How to reproduce:
1. Open QEMU with the given command
2. Try to switch console (Ctrl-Alt-2 for example)

Expected behaviour:
As in GTK, the window should now show the desired console

Actual behaviour:
Here I have to say I can't explain it very well. Almost always it just creates a new window that shows the desired console, but it is closed inmediatley. If not, it opens a new window that keeps open, and it sometimes is responsive, but further attempts to switch consoles end causing a crash, and QEMU has to be SIGKILLed

I think this should be fixed with the latest version of QEMU ... or can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
