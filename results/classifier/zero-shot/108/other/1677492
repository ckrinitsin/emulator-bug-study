block_set_io_throttle complaints Need exactly one of 'device' and 'id'

All of sudden, after a qemu update, block_set_io_throttle does not work anymore.

Full command to QEMU monitor -- 

(qemu) block_set_io_throttle db 0 0 0 0 0 0
Need exactly one of 'device' and 'id'

The help text still point to the same old syntax, which no longer works.

Broken in 2.8, fixed here (will be in 2.9):

    hmp: fix block_set_io_throttle

    Commit 7a9877a made the 'device' parameter to BlockIOThrottle
    optional, favoring 'id' instead.  But it forgot to update the
    HMP usage to set has_device, which makes all attempts to change
    throttling via HMP fail with "Need exactly one of 'device' and 'id'"
