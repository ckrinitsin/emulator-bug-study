The guest is only starting after its SDL window gets focus

I’m using i3wm and have workspace assigning rules that make QEMU’s SDL window be assigned to a workspace I don’t really switch to.

When I run start a guest machine, its SDL window is moved to that workspace (I never see it); but the machine freezes after displaying that black window. It only starts booting after I switch to the workspace and view the window.

Which version of SDL have you been using here? SDL 1.2 or SDL 2.0? If you were using 1.2, could you please try with 2.0 instead? Support for 1.2 has been removed now.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
