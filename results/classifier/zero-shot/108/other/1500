Some system/debug regisiters are inconsistent with real device in qemu-system-arm
Description of problem:
We used differential testing to compared the instruction consistency (ARMv7) between QEMU and raspberry pi 2B in system level and some inconsistency in system regisiter was detected.

1. CCSIDR--Cache Size ID Registers

   **Inconsistency**

   - CCSIDR in QEMU: 0x701fe00a--Associativity: 2, Number of sets:256

   - CCSIDR in  Raspi2B: 0x700fe01a--Associativity: 4, Number of sets:128

   **Tested Instruction sample**

   - MRC_T1A1_A 11101110001100000000111100010000 0xee300f10

   According to ARMv7 Manual B4.1.19 encoding, the NumSets and Associativity are set different bewteen QEMU when emulating raspi2b and raspi2b.

   The CCSIDR is set in the function`cortex_a7_initfn(Object *obj)` in target/arm/cpu_tcg.c for cortex_a7. 

2. DBGDRAR--Debug ROM Address Register

   **Inconsistency**

   - DBGDRAR in QEMU: 0x0 --Invalid

   - DBGDRAR in  Raspi2B: 0x40020003--Valid

   According to ARMv7 Manual C11.11.16 encoding, the DBGDRAR in qemu is invalid.

   **Tested Instruction sample**

   - MRC_T1A1_A 11101110000100010001111000010000 0xee111e10
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile a kernel module to run the test instruction in PL1.
2. Use kgdb to get the register info
