Pulse audio backend doesn't work in  v4.0.0-rc4 release

Using Gentoo linux, build from source: qemu v4.0.0-rc4 release (eeba63fc7fface36f438bcbc0d3b02e7dcb59983)

Pulse audio backend doesn't initialize because of the:
audio/paaudio.c:
-    if (!popts->has_server) {
-        char pidfile[64];
-        char *runtime;
-        struct stat st;
-
-        runtime = getenv("XDG_RUNTIME_DIR");
-        if (!runtime) {
-            return NULL;
-        }
-        snprintf(pidfile, sizeof(pidfile), "%s/pulse/pid", runtime);
-        if (stat(pidfile, &st) != 0) {
-            return NULL;
-        }
-    }
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not set for me. There is no /run/user directory exist in my system.

Also:
$ less ~/.pulse/client.conf  
default-server = unix:/home/ivan/.pulse_server

Removing this lines makes pa backend work fine again. Much better than 3.x versions due to buffer fixes.

It looks like this code relies on the systemd specifics and doesn't work with OpenRC used in Gentoo by default. Still not fixed in 4.0.0 release.

You can use -audiodev pa,id=whatever,server=unix:/home/ivan/.pulse_server to get things going with your configuration.

Oh, and this has nothing to do with systemd:

kraxel@gentoo ~ $ set | grep ^XDG
XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/etc/xdg
XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/local/share:/usr/share
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/var/run/user/1000
XDG_SESSION_COOKIE=gentoo-1556780854.41316-799155214

(gentoo with openrc + xfce, serial console login, x11 login has a few more of these set).

Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
