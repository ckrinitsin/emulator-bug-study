Cant Run Wine (posix not nptl) past 0.14.1

when trying to build qemu I can build with ./configure --static --enable-sdl --target-list=i386-linux-user just fine with 0.12.5

But when I try to go on 0.13.0 or higher (tested on 0.15.0) it will say it cant find libSDL.

Tried with arm and x86 versions of Ubuntu 9.10 and 11.04. Same on all 4 tests.

I found I could run posix wine on 12.5 but I cant go higher for posix wine because of that libSDL.

Oh I forgot to mention, you can compile qemu 0.13.0 or higher without the --static, and with --enable-sdl just fine all the way up to 0.15.5

But with --static, it cant find libSDL.

0.12.5 Can do this just fine. It can do --static --enable-sdl together, and find my libSDL, and run posix wine.

SDL is only of any use for the system emulation targets. If you're just building a linux-user target there is no point passing --enable-sdl to configure. Just use "./configure --static --target-list=i386-linux-user".


Thanks! Your right I disabled SDL and wine posix still worked on 12.5.. but not on 13.0 or higher.. I thought SDL was the reason why. ??? =) 

Wine posix isnt fun to get. http://www.onsitedentalsystems.com/wine.tar.gz 

the binary files in there run fine for qemu-i386 0.12.5 but nothing higher then that..  I dont know why.  

Triaging old bug tickets... The problem with the SDL static linking has likely been fixed here:
https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f37e6d4a7b22ccf1bb8fa4
Can you still reproduce the other issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
