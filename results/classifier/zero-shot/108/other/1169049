do not stop on first gdb breakpoint with -enable-kvm

I run qemu like this:
  qemu-system-x86-64 -enable-kvm -hda <path to file> -s -S,

and start gdb with commands like this:
  gdb>tartget remote localhost:1234
  gdb>break *0x7c00
  gdb>c

but gdb don't stop on it. I then could break execution manually and then breakpoints work.

QEMU version: 1.4.0 (from Debian repos)
GDB version: 7.5.1 (copiled from sources, but previous was 7.4.1 from Debian repo)

PS Same problem occure on Ubuntu 13.04 with same Qemu and Gdb 7.5.0 from repo.

Thank you

Which Linux kernel version were you using here? Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest Linux kernel version, and the latest version of QEMU?

Hello.
