The help document of qemu-img misses some options
Description of problem:
The "--help" option of qemu-img misses the option "skip-broken-bitmaps" for convert , "image-opts" for bench, "object" for dd and "force-share" for measure.
Steps to reproduce:
1. For the option "skip-broken-bitmaps", the following code appears during option parsing for convert and modifies the skip_broken in qemu-img.c:2377-2379.

```
        case OPTION_SKIP_BROKEN:
            skip_broken = true;
            break;
```

2. For the option "image-opts", the following code appears during option parsing for bench and modifies the image_opts in qemu-img.c:4511-4513.

```
        case OPTION_IMAGE_OPTS:
            image_opts = true;
            break;
```
3. For the option "object", the following code appears during option parsing for dd and calls the user_creatable_process_cmdline in qemu-img.c:4980-4982.

```
        case OPTION_OBJECT:
            user_creatable_process_cmdline(optarg);
            break;
```
4. For the option "force-share", the following code appears during option parsing for measure and modifies the force_share in qemu-img.c:5237-5239.
```
        case 'U':
            force_share = true;
            break;
```
Additional information:
But they do not appear in the document provided by "--help".

It may prevent users from using the relevant function.
