qemu-system-arm: ../hw/usb/hcd-dwc2.c:666: dwc2_glbreg_read: Assertion `addr <= GINTSTS2' failed.

When trying to run the 2016-05-27 Raspbian image on the emulated raspi2 platform, the system boots but shortly after the login prompt QEMU (master; commit ID ca489cd037e4d50dc6c40570a167504ad7e5a521) dies with:

qemu-system-arm: ../hw/usb/hcd-dwc2.c:666: dwc2_glbreg_read: Assertion `addr <= GINTSTS2' failed.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Get the image: wget http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2016-05-31/2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.zip

2. Extract the kernel image and DTB:

sudo losetup -f --show -P 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.img
sudo mkdir /mnt/rpi
sudo mount /dev/loop11p1 /mnt/rpi/
cp /mnt/rpi/kernel7.img .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
cp /mnt/rpi/bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
sudo umount /mnt/rpi 
sudo losetup -d /dev/loop11 

3. Run QEMU:
qemu-system-arm -M raspi2 -m 1G -dtb bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb -kernel kernel7.img -append "rw earlyprintk loglevel=8 console=ttyAMA0,115200 dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2" -sd 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.img -smp 4 -serial stdio -display none

A few seconds after the login prompt is displayed, QEMU will exit with the assertion failure.

I also tried changing all of the asserts to if statements that (for MMIO reads) returned 0 and (for writes) just returned, but this resulted in a non-responsive system.

Note for bisection: it looks like it works fine as of tag stable-4.2 .

What happens if you add "dwc_otg.fiq_fsm_enable=0" to the kernel command
line? This is noted as a requirement in the changelog at
https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/5.1

Yep, it looks like that works! Sorry for the bogus report, I didn't think to check the Changelog.

It is still a bug in QEMU -- we shouldn't allow guest behaviour to make QEMU assert(). If there's unimplemented functionality in the USB controller model that can be logged with qemu_log_mask(LOG_UNIMP, ...)


Hmm, yes agreed. I started a 2-week holiday on Monday, I can work on
this after I get back on Sept. 7

for me the output is:
% qemu-system-arm -M raspi2 -m 1G -dtb bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb -kernel kernel7.img -append "rw earlyprintk loglevel=8 console=ttyAMA0,115200 dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2" -sd 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.img -smp 4 -serial stdio -display none

         Automatically detecting the format is dangerous for raw images, write operations on block 0 will be restricted.

You can resize disk images with 'qemu-img resize <imagefile> <new-size>'
(note that this will lose data if you make the image smaller than it currently is).


That part is easily fixed by running

qemu-img resize 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.img 4G

ah, well then its the same error:
qemu-system-arm: /build/qemu/src/qemu-5.1.0/hw/usb/hcd-dwc2.c:666: dwc2_glbreg_read: Assertion `addr <= GINTSTS2' failed.


Are you able to modify the -append string to add "dwc_otg.fiq_fsm_enable=0", and if so does it fix the problem?

Nope:

qemu-system-arm -M raspi2 -m 1G -dtb bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb -kernel kernel7.img -append "rw earlyprintk loglevel=8 console=ttyAMA0,115200 dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 dwc_otg.fiq_fsm_enable=0" -sd 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.img -smp 4 -serial stdio -display none

raspberrypi login: qemu-system-arm: /build/qemu/src/qemu-5.1.0/hw/usb/hcd-dwc2.c:666: dwc2_glbreg_read: Assertion `addr <= GINTSTS2' failed.

Hmm, that's odd. I will try to reproduce this.

Something very strange is going on with the dwc_otg driver in 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.img. Something is reading and writing incrementally throughout the register space of the hcd-dwc2 host.
And adding the "dwc_otg.fiq_fsm_enable=0" kernel option does not fix it.

Brendan, Petunia, is there a reason why you are testing with such an old version of Raspbian? I used 2019-09-26-raspbian-buster.img when developing the hcd-dwc2 emulation, and it works fine, other than needing the "dwc_otg.fiq_fsm_enable=0" kernel option.

The URL to the image I used is http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2019-09-30/2019-09-26-raspbian-buster.zip

For my use case the newer image is fine too. I'm mildly curious what the dwc_otg driver is doing in the older image though.

I also tried http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2016-09-28/2016-09-23-raspbian-jessie.zip, which is the next Raspbian release after the cursed one, and it works OK too. So I assume any release after that will also work OK. Just in case anyone wants to use the older releases because they are smaller than the later ones.

So I dug into this a little more, and it looks like this issue has nothing to do with hcd-dwc2, other than it served as a canary because of the assert that fired. With hcd-dwc2 removed from the build, the 2016-05-27 Raspbian image still doesn't work, it hangs shortly after the login prompt appears on the console, before the GUI starts.

I tested with Qemu 4.0.0 and 4.2.1 and they are fine. The issue started with Qemu 5.0.0. hcd-dwc2 wasn't introduced until 5.1.0, so it can't be the root cause.

Since the issue doesn't seem to appear with any Raspbian distro since 2016-05-27, I don't know if anyone will be motivated to look into this any further. Should we just close this bug?

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


Fixed in commit 69958d8a3d9
("usb: hcd-dwc2: change assert()s to qemu_log_mask(LOG_GUEST_ERROR...)")
