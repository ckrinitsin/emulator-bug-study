I want get a qemu-img tool,which can run in Any linux operating system, what can i do?
Description of problem:
As we known,qemu-img depends on many dynamic libraries,it can't run in other os if libraries is not support.whether qemu can use static compilation to solve this problemï¼Ÿ


i refer to this [issue 1190](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1190),but when compile over,it not generate a static qemu-img. Or it has other functions to get a qemu-img which can run in Any linux operating system?
