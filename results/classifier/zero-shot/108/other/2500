m68k: mmu: 68030 mmu instructions are missing
Description of problem:
The 68030 has some mmu instructions like `pmove` that are only valid for the 68030 (and maybe the external mmu for the 68020??).
QEMU doesn't currently implement `pmove` and the encoding of `pmove` seems to be the same as an f-line instruction that should generate an f-line exception on everything except the 68030 so currently an f-line exception happens instead of the intended load/store to the mmu.
