USB Ethernet device (RNDIS) does not work on several tested operating systems

The USB ethernet device does not work on most versions of operating systems I have tested. For each operating system the command to use this device was: -netdev user,id=mynet1 -device usb-net,netdev=mynet1.


Windows 2000 (qemu-system-i386):
- failed to load a driver for the device


Windows 7 (qemu-system-x86_64):
- Did not find a driver
- Followed the directions here: https://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/how-to-install-microsoft-rndis-driver-for-windows-7
-- The device failed to start with error 10.
- Did see this message in the terminal on the host: 
usbnet: failed control transaction: request 0x8006 value 0x600 index 0x0 length 0xa


Mac OS 10.4.11 (qemu-system-ppc):
- It actually works.
- did see these messages in the terminal on the host:
usbnet: failed control transaction: request 0x2143 value 0x1c index 0x0 length 0x0
usbnet: failed control transaction: request 0x2143 value 0x1e index 0x0 length 0x0


Mac OS 10.8.5 (qemu-system-x86_64):
- Fails to obtain IP address using DHCP.
- The Network pane does say the device is connected. 
- A self-assigned IP address is given: 169.254.186.53.
-- It still did not work
- Did see this message in the terminal of the host:
usbnet: failed control transaction: request 0x2143 value 0x1c index 0x0 length 0x0
usbnet: failed control transaction: request 0x2143 value 0x1e index 0x0 length 0x0


Mac OS 10.2.3 (qemu-system-ppc):
- Did not appear to detect the USB NIC. Did not see it in the network pane.
- Apple System Profiler does see this device.
- Saw this message in there terminal of the host: qemu-system-ppc: Slirp: Failed to send packet, ret: -1


Mac OS 9.2 (qemu-system-ppc):
- Apple System Profiler does show the device connected.
- The Tcp/ip control panel did not detect this device.


My guess is this device is buggy. If anyone has any tips or suggestions please let me know.

Thank you.
