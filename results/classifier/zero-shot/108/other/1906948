Enabling OpenGL for GUI doesn't work on old laptop

QEMU start command is:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 2G -cpu host -smp 2 -cdrom ./linuxmint-20-mate-64bit.iso -boot d -vga virtio -soundhw hda -display gtk,gl=on


and QEMU crashes immediately on startup and gives these error messages:


qemu_gl_create_compile_shader: compile vertex error

If I remove "gl=on" it will boot. Does this just mean that this hardware is too old to run QEMU with OpenGL enabled in GUI, or is this a bug? 

Host OS is Debian 10, computer is a Lenovo laptop with Core i5-520M CPU and its integrated Intel HD graphics GPU.

QEMU version is 3.1.0 from Debian repositories.

The QEMU project does not support version 3.1 anymore. Can you either please report this to the Debian bug tracker instead, or check whether the problem is still reproducible with the latest version of QEMU (v5.2 will be likely released tomorrow)?

I installed Qemu 5.0.0 from Debian Buster backports and I still get this error.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

Still happens in 5.2.0 (Debian 1:5.2+dfsg-3~bpo10+1). Is this just due to hardware which is too old?


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
