QEMU in user-mode emulation mode crashes when the user program jumps to an invalid address

Running this code:

void (*func)() = 0x12345678;

int main()
{
    func();
    return 0;
}

Produces the following output:

qemu-arm-static: /build/qemu-DqynNa/qemu-2.8+dfsg/translate-all.c:175: tb_lock: Assertion `!have_tb_lock' failed.
qemu-arm-static: /build/qemu-DqynNa/qemu-2.8+dfsg/translate-all.c:175: tb_lock: Assertion `!have_tb_lock' failed.
Segmentation fault

The expected result is as follows:

qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
Segmentation fault



I'm not sure exactly when we fixed this (the fix is probably in the 4.1 release) but as of current head-of-git this correctly generates the SIGSEGV.
