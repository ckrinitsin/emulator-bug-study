Assertion fail while usb camera redirect

This may happen during usb camera redirect. But if i move the camera lens from left to right or up to down, this always happen. My qemu-version is 2.10.0 and following is the error information:

2018-10-26T03:37:54.925231Z qemu-kvm: usbredirparser: error unexpected extra data ep 00
qemu-kvm: hw/usb/redirect.c:1313: usbredir_chardev_read: Assertion `dev->read_buf == ((void *)0)' failed.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
