Cannot make program Icon on my desktop with rightmouse key

Howdy Xubuntu users

How can I make a "starter program Icon on my desktop" with the mouse command right key.

I do not seen the commands when I hit the right key of my mouse.

Hope to see some info in my pigeon-hole.

This apparently has nothing to do with QEMU. Closing.
