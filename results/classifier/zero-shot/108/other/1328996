[AArch64] - blr x30 is handled incorrectly

Whenever x30 is used as the operand for blr, the result will be incorrect.  There is no restriction on using x30 (LR) with the blr instruction in the ARMv8 manual.  There are two statically linked 64-bit executables in files.tar.gz: good and bad.  The executable "good" uses "blr x9", and the output is what is expected: "func".  The executable "bad" uses "blr x30" and nothing is printed out.  It prints "func" on the actual device.



I think this should already be fixed in master by commit 1b505f93bcf60 (about a month ago). Can you try a newer QEMU build, please?



Thanks, Peter.  I just built the latest development build, and it now passes.  Sorry for the false alarm.
