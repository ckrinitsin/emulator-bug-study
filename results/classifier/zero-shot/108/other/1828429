qemu-system-aarch64 crashes with assertion failed while running GCC 9 test suite

I am using QEMU 4.0.0 on an x86_64 Linux 4.19.0 host, the guest is an Aarch64 linux 5.0.0 system. The same issue occurred on QEMU 3.1.0.

While running the GCC 9.1 test suite on the guest system, QEMU crashes with:

qemu-system-aarch64: [...]/qemu-4.0.0/tcg/tcg.c:3952: tcg_gen_code: Assertion `s->gen_insn_end_off[num_insns] == off' failed.

I am able to reproduce the issue reliably, which is encouraging. The full QEMU command line is:

qemu-system-aarch64 -kernel kernel-5.0.0cbl1 -append "root=/dev/vda1 ro init=/sbin/init console=ttyAMA0" -name guest=cbl -drive file=cbl.qcow2,index=0,media=disk,format=qcow2 -drive file=swap.qcow2,index=1,media=disk,format=qcow2 -machine virt -cpu cortex-a57 -smp 4,sockets=1,cores=2,threads=2 -m size=8192 -netdev tap,id=network0,ifname=tapcbl2,script=no,downscript=no -device virtio-net-device,netdev=network0,mac=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:02 -nographic

The specific GCC test that causes QEMU to crash is vldX.c run from advsimd-intrinsics.exp; I can reproduce via "make check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS=advsimd-intrinsics.exp=vldX.c"

If there is anything I can do to further triage the issue, or gain more insight into what is going on, please let me know! I am eager to help however I can.

Hi -- this looks rather like bug #1824853, which exists in QEMU 4.0 but which we have fixed in git. Could you try with a build of QEMU from current head-of-git to confirm that it's fixed there ?


I'm on it. Will follow up when I have a result.

Confirmed, this is a duplicate of 1824853 and is resolved in 68a7b9724fe80bedb85060bde605213ce3f9baec.
