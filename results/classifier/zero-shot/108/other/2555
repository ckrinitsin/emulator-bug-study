Can't start a guest with 2 IOAPICs
Description of problem:
For a host with multiple IOAPICs, I want to start a guest with 2 IOAPICs. I saw this commit about this function: **[x86: add support for second ioapic]**:
     https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/94c5a606379ddd04beecdb11fb34b51b4b28c7f2

But after I started a guest in a host with multiple IOAPICs, there was still only one IOAPIC in guest. How should I enable this feature?
