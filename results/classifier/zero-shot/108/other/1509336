USB passthru  not work with  Mac OS X  El Capitan

QEMU emulator version 2.4.50 with kernel kvm module from linux kernel 3.16.0 or 4.2.3

Since upgrading from Yosemite to El Capitan - USB passthru does not work. Note USB passthru worked perfectly with  Maverick and Yosemite. I attempt to use different USB hosts. I found a patch for widows xp that had similar problem the patch was applied in 2012. Note NO problems with USB passthru with windows or linux clients. If it matters the devices that I am trying to passthru USB are smartcard reader and webcam.  The devices are present in El Capitan but do not function. 

These are the massages from loading the VM (El Capitan). The first two lines are from the clover bootloader. The ehci warnings are generated when loading Mac Os X El Capitan.

QEMU 2.4.50 monitor - type 'help' for more information
### These messages below started when  using the clover bootloader and occur when loading El Capitan, Maverick or Yosemite. 
### The bootloader is Clover  version 3292

      is enabled and HC is enabled
ehci: ASYNC list address register set while async schedule
      is enabled and HC is enabled

#### Below are errors when the guest host (El Capitan) is loading from qemu monitor.  The messages below only occur when loading El Capitan. 
ehci warning: guest requested more bytes than allowed

This is the errors from the guest os - Mac Os X - El Capitan

the following qemu command has worked flawlessly with Yosemite and Maverick.

If anything else I can do to debug the problem please let me know.

My problem was solved by using the UEFI boot loader and I followed the instructions at the following links:

https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/How-to-build-OVMF

http://www.linux-kvm.org/downloads/lersek/ovmf-whitepaper-c770f8c.txt

Also remove the "-bios"  option above and added the following options. 

-drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly,file=OVMF_CODE.fd   \
-drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=OVMF_VARS.fd \

Also changed clover to boot with UEFI only. Anyway that has used clover  will know how to change this option.
