mouse pointer does not move in USB pass in.
Description of problem:
I have this script to start qemu that passes in my mouse, keyboard and xbox controller. When I use it, it does not move the cursor(for my mouse) but the mouse is working because the hot corners do. Moving my mouse in a up left direction in GNOME will show the menu and apps. Key board works, My controller works, and My mouse works, but the cursor does not move.
Steps to reproduce:
1. use the script above with the right USB IDs for you mouse and keyboard (and controller if you want)
2. When the VM boots it will not move the cursor. The mouse will work but the pointer stays still.
Additional information:
I am using thees patches in qemu but it does not work in vanilla ether:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241010182427.1434605-1-seanjc@google.com/

and this in the kernel (6.14.0):
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/377b2f359d1f71c75f8cc352b5c81f2210312d83

I am ruining qemu 10.0.0-rc1 (but 9.2.2 also does not work), kernel 6.14.0.
