Error 0x5D in Qemu for Windows 

The reason to use qemu for Windows is that the mouse in emulated Windows works well while it is unusable in  qemu at Ubuntu. 
Alternative solution/bug is mouse usability in qemu for Linux.
Well-known issue of error 0x5D when booting Win 7 x64 on qemu without kvm, marked as resolved at Linux.

Used qemu for Windows downloaded from http://qemu.weilnetz.de/
Tested on  qemu 2.3.94 64-bit and  qemu 2.4.0 32-bit.

Options :
qemu-system-x86_64.exe  -m 1536 -cpu qemu64,+nx,+pae,+mce,+cx8,+apic,+sep,+mtrr,+pge,+mca,+cmov,+pat,+pse36,+clflush,+acpi,+mmx,+fxsr,+sse,+sse2,+ss,+fxsr,+sse,+sse2,+ss,+de,+mtrr,+mca,+clflush
 win_7_work.qcow2

On qemu at Ubuntu with kvm Win7 x64 works ,but mouse is unusable as mentioned above.

A solution is to convert from vmdk to qcow2 and back working in VmWare with Windows images. Repeated  Windows activation could be needed.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Have you tried "-usb -device usb-tablet" already?
