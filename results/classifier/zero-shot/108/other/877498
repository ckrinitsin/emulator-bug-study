qemu does not pass sector size from physical devices to virtual devices

When passing a physical disk (i.e. a multipathed fcal volume in my case) with a 4k sector size as raw image to qemu (-drive file=/dev/mapper/hartebeest-sys,if=none,id=drive-virtio-disk0,boot=on,format=raw), the resulting virtual device has a sector size of 512b, rendering the partition table unusable!

QEMU 0.12 is pretty much outdated ... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU, or can we close this bug nowadays?

Hi,

I can’t verify it for the logical block size right away, but 
this bug still present for the physical block size in qemu-kvm 1:2.1+dfsg-1.

I will try to verify this bug with testing soon

QEMU 2.1 is also not supported anymore. Please test with the latest upstream QEMU version (2.8 ... or the latest 2.9 release candidate) - or otherwise report the bug in the bug tracker of your distribution instead.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

Recent QEMU is able to do read-modify-write operations when using 512 byte logical sectors in the VM and 4K logical sectors in the host.
