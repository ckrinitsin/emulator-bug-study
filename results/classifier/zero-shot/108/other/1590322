mouse_button 0 takes back to initial position

i wrote a python script to perform some drag function in the Qemu simulator.
mouse_move x , y
mouse_button 1
mouse_move new_x,new_y
mouse_move 0


The mouse_move 0 doesn't release the mouse in the position new_x,new_y instead it takes  it back to the point x,y and then releases the mouse

Did you mean "mouse_button 0" instead of "mouse_move 0" here?
