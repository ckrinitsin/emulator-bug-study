qemu-system-ppc: extra IPI interrupt on core0
Description of problem:
When I try to emit an IPI interrupt from core0 to another core via the MPIC controller(IPIDR1â€”Interprocessor interrupt dispatch register 1), core0 itself generates an unwanted IPI interrupt.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Prepare ISR routine, something like:

    void ipi_handler (void)
    {
	int core_id = CORE_ID_GET(); 
        myprintf("\n IPI interrupt triggered on core:%d\n",core_id);
    }
2. Create a task and bind it to core0. This task is mainly to write the MPIC controller to emit IPI interrupts to other cores.
    MPIC_REG_WRITE(MPIC_BASE + IPIDR1, **0xe**);

3. run the test task
Additional information:
/* Below test was tested on Qemu6.1 */

IPI interrupts are emitted by core:0

**IPI interrupt triggered on core:0** /* it's a bug, it should not trigger on core 0. */

IPI interrupt triggered on core:1

IPI interrupt triggered on core:2

IPI interrupt triggered on core:3


This bug only occurs when "emitting an IPIDR1 interrupt from **core0**".

------------


/* Below test was tested on real board(fsl_p4080ds) */

IPI interrupts are emitted by core:0

IPI interrupt triggered on core:1

IPI interrupt triggered on core:2

IPI interrupt triggered on core:3
