Does not add usb-host devices as they are hotplugged

A commandline such as

qemu-kvm -device usb-ehci,id=USBCtrl -device host-usb,bus=USBCtrl.0,hostbus=3

should automatically add all devices on the given bus (here: 3) not only initially, but also when new devices appear on that bus while Qemu runs. Currently, all devices on the bus are added initially, but new devices which are added to the (host) usb while Qemu runs have to be added manually.

With some devices, I get a speed mismatch with ehci-usb:
qemu-system-x86_64: Warning: speed mismatch trying to attach usb device "USB Keyboard" (( speed) to bus "ehci.0", port "1" (high speed)

nec-usb-xhci fixes the keyboard+usb-storage case, but it breaks a webcam:
qemu-system-x86_64: Warning: speed mismatch trying to attach usb device "Chicony WebCam" (high speed) to bus "usb.0", port "4.3" (full speed)

Anyway,  -device usb-host,... binds to only one device. If you disconnect that device, it will enumerate the next available one and use that. If you only have one port, then you might have more luck with the 'hostport' option. Example that adds all available ports (which might not be the best solution though):
qemu-system-x86_64 -usb -device usb-ehci,id=usb $(for i in {1..6};do echo -device usb-host,bus=usb.0,hostbus=2,hostport=1.$i;done)

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
