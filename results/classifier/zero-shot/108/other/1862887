qemu does not load pulseaudio modules properly

Hello,

This is on Arch-linux(latest) and the qemu 4.2.0 version made from git clone https://github.com/spheenik/qemu.git
with:
 ./configure --prefix=/opt/qemu-test --python=/usr/bin/python2 --target-list=x86_64-softmmu 
--audio-drv-list=pa --disable-werror
added to the build.

I've been workin on a passthrough Windows 10 vm this month and have been steadily seeing some promising progress. My block/issue at the moment is integrating the audio now that the GPU has been succesfully passed through. 
I've been going back and forth between the audio options for Pulseaudio and cannot change the following issue:
pulseaudio: pa_context_connect() failed
pulseaudio: Reason: Connection refused
pulseaudio: Failed to initialize PA contextlibusb: error [udev_hotplug_event] ignoring udev action bind
I leave my current operable build followed by some of the options that I have tried using to correct this despite the following errors not changing

This is my current operable build:

#!/bin/bash

vmname="windows10vm"

if ps -ef | grep /opt/qemu-test/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 | grep -q multifunction=on; then
echo "A passthrough VM is already running." &
exit 1

else

/opt/qemu-test/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 \
-m 12G \
-drive id=disk0,if=virtio,cache=none,format=raw,file=.../win2.img \
-drive file=.../Win10_1909_English_x64.iso,index=1,media=cdrom \
-drive file=.../virtio-win-0.1.171.iso,index=2,media=cdrom \
-boot order=dc \

-machine type=q35,accel=kvm,vmport=off \
-cpu host,kvm=off \
-smp 3,sockets=1,cores=3,threads=1 \
-device virtio-balloon \

-device usb-host,vendorid=...,productid=... \
-device vfio-pci,host=...,multifunction=on \
-device vfio-pci,host=... \
-device e1000,netdev=net0 \
-netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::...-:22 \

Here's a list of setting combinations I had tried to resolve this:

#export QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=pa
#QEMU_ALSA_DAC_BUFFER_SIZE=512 QEMU_ALSA_DAC_PERIOD_SIZE=170
#export QEMU_PA_SAMPLES=8192 
#export QEMU_AUDIO_TIMER_PERIOD=99
#export QEMU_PA_SERVER=/run/user/1000/pulse/native
#export QEMU_PA_SINK=alsa_output.usb-C-Media_Electronics_Inc._USB_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo
#export QEMU_PA_SOURCE=input

-audiodev pa,id=pa1,server=server=/run/user/1000/pulse/native

At best I have removed an XDG_RUNTIME_DIR error but other than that this build has no audio compatability.

EDIT: This is for Arch 2020.02.01

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
