RBD Namespaces are not supported

Ceph Nautilus (v14.2.0) introduced the Namespaces concept for RADOS Block Devices. This provides a logical separation within a RADOS Pool for RBD images which enables granular access control. See https://docs.ceph.com/docs/nautilus/releases/nautilus/ for additional details.

librados and librbd support this, however qemu does not. The rbd man page defines how rbd images within a namespace can be referenced. https://docs.ceph.com/docs/nautilus/man/8/rbd/#image-snap-group-and-journal-specs

Adding support for RBD namespaces would be beneficial for security and reducing the impact of a hypervisor being compromised and putting an entire Ceph pool or cluster at risk.

I just posted a patch today on the qemu-devel mailing list, you can find it there : https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-12/msg04344.html

Thanks for adding the support. I was actually already play-testing your patch. I'll respond to the mailing list soon.
