Suddenly no internet in guest system!

I use Opensuse 15.1 i have installed androidx86_64 as a guest system, it runs for over 3 years. i had a internetconnection, i could use apps etc. but since yesterday i can´t connect to the internet with the guest system in the host system all works fine. What could be the reason? There haven´t been an update and i haven´t changed anything. 
The settings in nic are: bridge br0: Hostdevice eth0
devicemodel: e1000

The qemu Version is from the opensuse repo: 3.1.1

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
