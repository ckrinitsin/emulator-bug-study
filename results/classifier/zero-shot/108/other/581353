qemu doesn't stop execution upon hitting a breakpoint

Using Qemu 0.12.3 and gdb 7.1 on Ubuntu Lucid.

I'm trying to debug some bootloader code. Using qemu -s -S to run the bootloader and gdb to connect to qemu, I set the breakpoint at 0x7c00. Then I type continue in gdb. The breakpoint is hit and gdb shows debug information. However qemu apparently continues to execute the code of the bootloader as the text is printed on the screen etc.

Attached is the bootloader (no debug symbols as I'm debugging without them)

Same thing happens to me, same versions as above.. I must turn to another app to accomplish my work while awaiting for a bug-fix, the code is perfectly executed but while gdb hits the breakpoints qemu goes on..

Ok this issue has been fixed in qemu 0.12.4.

Just type 'qemu --version' to see what version you have, it is probably outdated.

According to comment #3, this has been fixed, so let's change the bug status accordingly.
