Windows guest agent shutdown requires user response to complete
Additional information:
The shutdown operation triggered by the Windows Guest Agent should prevent the system from waiting for a user response concerning unsaved work of open desktop applications. Instead, applications and services should be closed as gracefully as possible automatically, in advance of  the power down event on the emulated hardware.
