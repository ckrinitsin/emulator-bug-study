usb-host devices given by command line are routed incomplete to the guest

affected qemus: qemu-1.0, qemu-kvm-1.0, qemu and qemu-kvm master branches (older versions not tested)
affected guests: linux, windows
test hardware: standard usb key (or any other piece of USB hardware) that works perfectly when plugged in after guest bootup

Several Sequences have been tested:
- start qemu with  -readconfig /etc/ich9-ehci-uhci.cfg -device usb-tablet -device usb-host,bus=ehci.0
- start qemu with -readconfig /etc/ich9-ehci-uhci.cfg -device usb-tablet -S (to not start up the guest directly) + at the console prompt: "device_add usb-host" then "c" to start the guest.

For the linux guest, I get a usb device listed and detected as /dev/sdb when plugging it in at runtime. At startup linux does NOT detect it.
For the windows guest, I get a usb device listed and detected as "removable media" when plugging it in at runtime. At startup Windows does detect "something" that is listed in the device manager as Generic Mass Storage device, but with a yellow exclamation mark and there is no removable media listed in Explorer

If you need further testings, just let me know.

update:
it works with the following parameter set:
-usb -device usb-host
but then only USB 1.1 is available (very slow)

it does not work with:
-readconfig ich9-ehci-uhci.cfg -device usb-host,bus=ehci.0
but there I have USB 2.0 and USB 1.1 devices routed perfectly with a good speed to the guest at runtime

the .cfg is taken from the docs/ directory
I also tested with ehci-only parameters (no uhci / companion), same effect

And: This seems only to be related to USB 2.0 devices!
I tested both with a USB 1.1 device plugged in before starting the guest and there it works perfectly.

it would be really great to find a solution for that


update:

Seems to affect only USB 2.0 devices and if USB 2.0 (EHCI) is enabled.

If there is only -usb -device usb-host added, it works for both USB 2.0 and USB 1.1 but extremely slow due to the missing USB 2.0 layer
If the command line is given as reported above, it works for USB 1.1 devices, too! USB 2.0 devices show the problems as reported.


Still present with the latest patch queue and update from the GIT master.


Triaging old bug tickets ... can you somehow still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU (currently v2.9), or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
