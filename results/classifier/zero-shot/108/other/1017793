S3 Trio64V+ support

Is it possible to add S3 Trio emulation to QEMU at all? Since 0.12.3 the Cirrus Logic seems no longer working properly (bad font render/corrupted video). Also, S3 is a widely supported device on many OSes and architectures, which will give more compatibility for QEMU.

Thanks!

Sorry, seems like nobody got interested in adding S3 emulation to QEMU within the last 6 years, so this is very unlikely going to happen. Thus I'm closing this bug ticket now.
