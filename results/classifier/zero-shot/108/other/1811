ppc serial appears to have a maximum ratio of output to input, hides output and only writes it on subsequent input(?!)
Description of problem:
When pasting in large chunks of text, the echo is partial, but completes with subsequent writes (and is drained when the writes are small). Sorry this is really stupid, see video.

(also, when booting, the console stops at

)
Steps to reproduce:
1. `cat > /dev/null`
2. paste in a couple solid lines
3. observe that the echo completed mid-line
4. paste in a couple more solid lines
5. observe that the echo includes the end of the first few lines, and the start of the second set
6. ^D
7. observe that with every key input into the shell, you get a few bytes back, and those bytes are the tail-end of the second set of lines
8. when the echo buffer is drained, it's drained
