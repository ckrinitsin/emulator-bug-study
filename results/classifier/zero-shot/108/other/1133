unused memory filled with 0x00 instead of 0xFF
Description of problem:
Qemu, ever since it was made (so, since 2003), has this problem in DOS (either PC-DOS or MS-DOS and partly Windows 9x) not recognizing the memory available when the memory is filled with 0x00 but when it is filled with 0xFF it gets recognized properly, where should I patch qemu to solve this memory problem?
