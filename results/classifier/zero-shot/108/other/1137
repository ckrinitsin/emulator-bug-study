When using qemu-system-x86_64 whpx acceleration, cpu information is set strangely.
Description of problem:
When using the guest with whpx acceleration in qemu-system-x86_64, the CPU information of the guest seems to be set strangely.

When the guest is Linux, it seems that individual CPUs are allocated as many as the number of cores when using the -accel whpx option and the -smp option.
* -smp 4, -smp cores=4, -smp sockes=1, cores=4, threads=1 are all set to have 4 single-core CPUs plugged in

If the guest is Windows, check the information with CPU-Z
 It is recognized as a Pentium 4 and is displayed as a CPU with 1 core and n threads.

Physically, it seems to be set to have n individual CPUs with 1 core plugged in.
In Windows 11 Home (which seems to be the case for all versions of Windows Home), you cannot give the -smp value more than 5.
* When booting with the -smp option value of 5 or more, a BSOD saying multiprocessor configuration not supported appears. -smp n, -smp cores=n, -smp sockes=1,cores=n,threads=1 All same symptoms occur
Steps to reproduce:
1. Boot Windows or Linux with -accel whpx -smp 4 option (or with the -accel whpx -smp sockets=1,cores=4,threads=1 option to make it deterministic)
2. For Linux guest, use cat /proc/cpuinfo to check cpu information, for Windows guest, use cpu-z, device manager, task manager, etc. to check cpu information
3. In the information of the Linux guest, it is displayed as fixed as core id : 0, cpu cores : 1, 
   In Windows guest, information is displayed as written in "Description of problem" respectively.
