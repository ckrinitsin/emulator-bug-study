alphabetical order of monitor options

Looking for the 'continue'/'resume' option I found this order that was not quite 'alphabetical'.
It had me overlook the 'cont' option at glance. Which is just a little impractical.

...
boot_set bootdevice -- define new values for the boot device list
change device filename [format [read-only-mode]] -- change a removable medium, optional format
chardev-add args -- add chardev
chardev-remove id -- remove chardev
client_migrate_info protocol hostname port tls-port cert-subject -- set migration information for remote display
closefd closefd name -- close a file descriptor previously passed via SCM rights
commit device|all -- commit changes to the disk images (if -snapshot is used) or backing files
cpu index -- set the default CPU
cpu-add id -- add cpu
c|cont  -- resume emulation
delvm tag|id -- delete a VM snapshot from its tag or id
...

I tested this list with 'sort' just to make sure and make a point:

$ cat Desktop/order-orig.txt 
boot_set
change
chardev-add
chardev-remove
client_migrate_info
closefd
commit
cpu
cpu-add
c|cont
delvm
$ cat Desktop/order-orig.txt | sort
boot_set
c|cont
change
chardev-add
chardev-remove
client_migrate_info
closefd
commit
cpu
cpu-add
delvm
$
