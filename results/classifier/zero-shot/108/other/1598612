Windows for Workgroups 3.11 installer crashes with a general protection fault

I used only disk images from here: http://ia801606.us.archive.org/zipview.php?zip=/22/items/IBM_PC_Compatibles_TOSEC_2012_04_23/IBM_PC_Compatibles_TOSEC_2012_04_23.zip

When I try to install Windows for Workgroups 3.11 on either PC DOS 2000 or MS-DOS 6.22, the installer crashes after entering the graphical part with two dialogs containing:

Application Error
WINSETUP caused a General Protection Fault in module <unknown>0EDF:7011WINSETUP will close.

Application Error
WINSETUP caused a General Protection Fault in module USER.EXE at 0001:40B6.

And then:
Standard Mode: Bad Fault in MS-DOS Extender.
Fault: 000D Stack Dump: 0000 0000 0070
Raw fault frame: EC=0000 IP=5EF7 CS=037F FL=3087 SP=FFEE SS=02DF

This happens both with and without KVM. I tested with QEMU from Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 and recent GIT (ef8757f1fe8095a256ee617e4dbac69d3b33ae94).

Windows 3.1 has the same problem, but the errors are slightly different:

Application Error
WINSETUP caused a General Protection Fault in module <unknown>0C77:7011WINSETUP will close.

Application Error
WINSETUP caused a General Protection Fault in module KRNL386.EXE at 0001:9F03.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has be

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
