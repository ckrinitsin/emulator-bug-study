"segmentaion" error when DMAing

When working with QEMU's PCI network card E1000 emulator, I accidentally put virtual addresses into the memory mapped registers when I should have put physical addresses. Short story is, the address was too large for the physical address space so when the network card tried to DMA the location it tossed a "segmentaion" error out to the console. That's right--not a "segmentation" error, but a "segmentaion" error. I just thought I'd let ya'll know about that little typo. 

My "qemu -version" gives "QEMU emulator version 0.15.0, Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard" on linux version 2.6.32. I guess it might be an older version, dunno if the typo's still there.

Was it "TCP segmentaion Error"? Then it is still there.

Thanks for reporting. It will be fixed in latest QEMU.

Yeah it was. Sorry, should have specified. Thanks!
