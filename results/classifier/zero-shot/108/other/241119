usb_add of a Creative ZEN unrecognized in guest

Binary package hint: kvm

This happens when I add my Creative ZEN to a virtual machine running XP. The device is recognised well at first and drivers are installed correctly. But when trying to connect windows crashes with the classic blue screen It complains about something like usbohci.sys, I can't read well because it crashes too fast.
I have also tried with another virtual machine running Vista, same results.
Any help would be really appreciated!

I'm using the module kvm-amd with Ubuntu 8.04

The USB device has the following ID: 041e:4157 Creative Technology, Ltd

kvm:
  Installed: 1:62+dfsg-0ubuntu7
  Candidate: 1:62+dfsg-0ubuntu7
  Version table:
 *** 1:62+dfsg-0ubuntu7 0
        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com hardy/main Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

Hi, thanks for the bug report.

This bug was reported against Hardy's kvm-62.  Unfortunately, kvm-62 is not able to do usb-passthrough properly.

Would it be possible for you to test this against intrepid and/or jaunty?

If you're running Hardy, could you please test this using the kvm-84 package in this PPA:
 * https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-virt/+archive/ppa

Does this solve the issue, or is it reproducible?

:-Dustin


I'm running Intrepid now, however I tried the package you suggested (kvm-84) but the problem persists.

kvm:
  Installed: 1:84+dfsg-0ubuntu8~ppa6
  Candidate: 1:84+dfsg-0ubuntu8~ppa6
  Version table:
 *** 1:84+dfsg-0ubuntu8~ppa6 0
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
     1:72+dfsg-1ubuntu6 0
        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com intrepid/main Packages

The console output when trying to usb_add the device is the following:

husb: open device 1.5
husb: config #1 need -1
husb: 1 interfaces claimed for configuration 1
husb: grabbed usb device 1.5
usb_linux_update_endp_table: Protocol error


I forgot:

Using the new kvm package the virtual machine now doesn't crash with the blue screen anymore. Now it seems like the device is not correctly recognized or initialized

Okay, the problem persists in kvm-84.  I'll mark it as 'Confirmed', and point upstream at the issue.  Thanks.

@Dustin 
Did this hit upstream, I looked yesterday and couldn't find it to track it.

To copy this upstream, click "Also affects project", and enter "qemu".

kvm-84 is very old.  Please try to reproduce this against the latest qemu git or at least 0.12.4.

Hi. I have a similar problem, with a simple JetFlash usb drive.

After adding it with usb_add, "info usb" shows nothing and I start getting the following message in the console:
husb: config #1 need -1
husb: 1 interfaces claimed for configuration 1
husb: grabbed usb device 1.3
usb_linux_update_endp_table: Protocol error

This is under Maverick using qemu-kvm 0.12.5+noroms-0ubuntu7

The same operation works fine in the same pc under my gentoo system, currently running qemu-kvm-0.13.0, but it has been working now for a year, without ever giving me problems.

Hi,

is this still an issue under natty or oneiric?

Hi, unfortunately my Creative ZEN (for which I initially issued the bug) broke, so I am not able to verify if it is an issue anymore, I'm sorry.

[Expired for qemu-kvm (Ubuntu) because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

Closing this bug since the hardware is not available anymore (according to comment #11).
