s390x binaries segfault

Hello World appears to segfault with qemu s390x, on a Debian 10.0.0 Buster amd64 host.

$ cat hello.cpp 
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
    return 0;
}

$ s390x-linux-gnu-g++ -o hello hello.cpp

$ qemu-s390x-static hello
Segmentation fault

Does "make check-tcg" work in this case? It works for me here.

Which QEMU version are you using here? Can you reproduce this issue with the latest upstream QEMU ? ... otherwise, please report this issue to the Debian bug tracker instead.
