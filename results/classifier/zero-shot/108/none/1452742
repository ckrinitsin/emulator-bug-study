the option for vdagent communication needed for qxl scren resizing is not documented

Hello,

I tried running a guest with vdagent which is supposed to resize the guest screen to match client window size.

However, a special serial port needs to be created for the vdagent to communicate with the client.

This patch adds a short note to the vga qxl option.



To be able to include your patch, you've got to send it to the qemu-devel mailing list, with a proper Signed-off-by line. Please see http://qemu-project.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch#Submitting_your_Patches for details.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
