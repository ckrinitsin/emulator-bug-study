qemu-io: Exit code is always zero

The qemu-io always returns zero on exit independently on errors occurred during the command execution.

Example,

$ qemu-io -c 'write 128 234' /tmp/run1/test-1/test.img 

offset 128 is not sector aligned

$ echo $?
0

For single commands it makes sense to return the command success as the
exit code.

When qemu-io is used interactively or with multiple -c options we need a
error handling policy.

For this reason it is not totally trivial to implement.

Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Should be fixed as of 6b3aa8485ca8e.
