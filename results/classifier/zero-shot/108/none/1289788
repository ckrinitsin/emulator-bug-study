MIDI access (not only adlib) hangs WinNT on QEMU 1.7.x

Windows NT 4.0 and 2000 (including the latest git release), when enabling adlib (with sb16 already enabled) or the built-in synth of the es1370, hang on QEMU 1.7.x (also with 1.7.50) when they try to play MIDI files (like canyon.mid, etc). I have already tried bisecting but seems that this bug has been introduced sometime in 1.7.0's development time.

Is this problem still reproducible with the latest version of QEMU?

A midi file played very will using SB16. It didn't work at all with adlib, and it played poorly in es1370. I used Windows 2000 as the guest. There were no hangs.
