tap downscript is not executed when exiting qemu through "quit" monitor command

When you tell qemu to shutdown using the "quit" monitor command, the downscript of the tap interface is not executed.


To reproduce:


Create the test script /tmp/qemu-ifdown-test.sh :

==
#!/bin/bash

touch /tmp/is_this_working
==

Run:

==
# chmod +x /tmp/qemu-ifdown-test.sh
# qemu-system-x86_64 -daemonize -net nic -net tap,script=/etc/qemu-ifup,downscript=/tmp/qemu-ifdown-test.sh -monitor unix:/tmp/monitor.socket,nowait,server
VNC server running on `127.0.0.1:5900'
# nc -U /tmp/monitor.socket 
QEMU 0.12.5 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) quit
quit
# ls /tmp/is*
ls: cannot access /tmp/is*: No such file or directory

==

If I quit qemu by sending a SIGTERM instead of using the "quit" command, the downscript does get executed:

==
# qemu-system-x86_64 -daemonize -net nic -net tap,script=/etc/qemu-ifup,downscript=/tmp/qemu-ifdown-test.sh -monitor unix:/tmp/monitor.socket,nowait,server
VNC server running on `127.0.0.1:5900'
# killall qemu-system-x86_64
# ls /tmp/is*
/tmp/is_this_working
==

Issue occurs with both 0.12.3 and 0.12.5

Have you reported this to QEMU developers' mailing list?

Thanks for providing instructions on how to reproduce this bug.  I ran your instructions on qemu.git/master and the issue does not occur.

QEMU 0.12.x is old, please try the latest stable release 0.15.0 or qemu.git/master.
