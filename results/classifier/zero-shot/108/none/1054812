Configure uses wrong libtool on Darwin

On Darwin/OS X, there are two versions of libtool: the GNU libtool, and Apple's libtool. Both are installed, but Apple's libtool (libtool) won't build libcacard that Qemu uses, but Gnu's libtool (glibtool) does. I get around using Apple's libtool by passing LIBTOOL=glibtool when configuring; unfortunately this variable isn't preserved so when Qemu's configure changes it's not passed. A simple switch in the configure script could check for Darwin, then if present, use glibtool. Or configure could check the features of libtool, see if they can build libcacard, then look for alternatives like glibtool. 

This bug was probably introduced when libcacard was added to Qemu, and is present in commit 93b6599734f81328ee3d608f57667742cafeea72.

Since libcacard is not longer part of QEMU, I assume this is not an issue anymore today. So can we close this bug nowadays?

Yes, libtool handling was removed entirely in commit e999ee443496b, so this bug is no longer present.
