virtio-blk: BDRV_REQ_REGISTERED_BUF optimization hint crashes on macOS
Description of problem:
When using QEMU 7.2.0 on macOS with the virtio-blk drive, the process will exit and QMP shows a `BLOCK_IO_ERROR` event. This appears to be caused by this line: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/hw/block/virtio-blk.c#L405 introduced in https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/baf422684d73c7bf38e2c18815e18d44fcf395b6

Commenting that line out fixes the issue.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the QEMU command above with a Ubuntu 22.04 server ISO image.
2. Follow the installer and try to get to the end.
3. The process will crash before you can finish installing.
Additional information:
Following event appears on QMP:
```
{
    data =     {
        action = report;
        device = "drive437EC806-41A4-4CCE-A747-713352E7C27C";
        "node-name" = "#block785";
        nospace = 0;
        operation = write;
        reason = "Invalid argument";
    };
    event = "BLOCK_IO_ERROR";
    timestamp =     {
        microseconds = 808474;
        seconds = 1671867673;
    };
}
```
