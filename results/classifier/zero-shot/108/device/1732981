usb-net on aarch64 has wrong class IDs, isn't recognized by Windows

If I run qemu-system-aarch64 with "-device usb-net,...", the resulting USB device will be seen in the guest as class 0x2, subclass 0x2, protocol 0xFF, instead of the expected class 0xe0, subclass 0x1, protocol 0x3. This prevents Windows' in-box class driver from binding to the device. On x86 and x64 Windows, this is not an issue, as another driver will bind to the device, but in Windows for ARM64, that driver is unavailable, so the USB device is incorrectly recognized as a serial port.

Installing a modified version of the inbox driver in "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement" mode solves the issue, but it's not a very clean solution.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
