audio recording not working on qemu
Description of problem:
QEMU fails to record audio from the guest even when the device options hda-duplex and hda-micro options are used. Tried using the other available audio backends (alsa and sdl) but recording on the guest still fails
Steps to reproduce:
1. run the qemu command line above with any of the available audio backends
2. record audio on the guest 
3. arecord -vv -d 5 recordng.wav
4. there's an attempt to record but it hangs
5. play recorded audio, there's no output
6. aplay recordng.wav
