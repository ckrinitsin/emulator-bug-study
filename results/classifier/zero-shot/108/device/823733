Solaris can't be powered off with ACPI shutdown/poweroff

Thank you forgive my poor English.

It seems KVM can’t poweroff solairs 10 or sloalrs 11 VM.
I have created solaris 10 and 11 as usual. Everything in VM is running OK, but finally I use shell command ‘poweroff’ or ‘init 5’, the solaris VM (both 10 & 11) system could’t be poweroff but with promoting me the message: perss any key to reboot …..  ,I pressed any key in vnc client, solaris VM reboot immediately. Endless reboot loop above.

the solaris 10 & 11 from oracle iso file name :
sol-10-u9-ga-x86-dvd.iso
sol-11-exp-201011-text-x86.iso

the solaris 10 & 11 from oracle iso file name :
sol-10-u9-ga-x86-dvd.iso
sol-11-exp-201011-text-x86.iso

1. On my real physical machine,the solaris can be poweroff
2. On vmware ,the solaris can be poweroff
3. On my real physical machine,I have try to disbale the ACPI opiton in BOIS, then the solaris can't be poweroff,Like the problem I have described above
so ,I doubt the KVM has a little problem in ACPI 

I have try the suggestion as follows, but I can’t solve the problem.
7.2 Solaris reboot all the time on grub menu
•	Run through the installer as usual 
•	On completion and reboot, the VM will perpetually reboot. "Stop" the VM. 
•	Start it up again, and immediately open a vnc console and select the Safe Boot from the options screen 
•	When prompted if you want to try and recover the boot block, say yes 
•	You should now have a Bourne terminal with your existing filesystem mounted on /a 
•	Run /a/usr/bin/bash (my preferred shell) 
•	export TERM=xterm 
•	vi /a/boot/grub/menu.1st (editing the bootloader on your mounted filesystem), to add "kernel/unix" to the kernel options for the non-safe-mode boot. Ex : 
Config File : /a/boot/grub/menu.lst 
kernel$ /platform/i86pc/multiboot -B $ZFS-BOOTFS kernel/unix

According to KVM requirements, I collected the following information:
CPU model name
model name      : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU           X3450  @ 2.67GHz

Guest OS
Solaris 10 and Solaris 11，both can not shutdown

The qemu command line you are using to start the guest 

First, I used the command line as follows:
kvm -m 1024 -drive file=solaris10.img,cache=writeback -net nic -net user -nographic -vnc :1
then I try to use -no-kvm-irqchip or -no-kvm ,but the problem also appears!

Secondly, have created and run solaris 10&11 by using Virsh, still solaris can't be poweroff, the XML file content is :

Triaging old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU (currently version 2.9.0)?

I just ran into the same issue on Arch with qemu 2.9.0 and as well Ubuntu qemu 2.8.something. Solaris 11 on powerdown shuts down to the point where it prompts you that it's now safe to power off the VM, works fine in vmware or virtualbox.
In a packer build at this point you just fail as the VM did not power down in time.


I can reproduce the issue with modern illumos distributions like OpenIndiana 2017.10 on Linux KVM host with QEMU 2.10.1 (illumos is OpenSolaris OS/Net - i.e. "the kernel" - heir, roughly equal to Solaris 11).

It's still the case illumos will shut down on other hypervizors e.g. VirtualBox. I raised the question on #illumos IRC chat and an illumos developer replied it might be a shortage in illumos that "it's not playing nice with some ACPI emulation bugs".

This bug was reported almost 9 years ago and still nobody take care about it...
