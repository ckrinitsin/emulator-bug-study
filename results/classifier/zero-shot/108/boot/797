ARM64 hvf fails to boot Windows 11 on 6.2.0
Description of problem:
On QEMU v6.1.0 with patches from @agraf manually applied, Windows 11 boots fine from the VHDX. Now that the patches have been mainlined, I would expect it to work the same but it gets stuck at EFI (no Windows "spinner").
Steps to reproduce:
1. `brew install qemu`
2. Download Windows 11 VHDX from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64
3. Run command from above.
