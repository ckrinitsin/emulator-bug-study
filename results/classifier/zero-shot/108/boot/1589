Crash when using qemu 8.0.0 version tcg mode
Description of problem:
Can I no longer use qemu in tcg mode?
When operating in tcg mode in all versions of 8.0.0, a crash occurs on the booting screen and the window closes (the window stops responding before closing).
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run qemu with -accel tcg option
2. enter the boot screen
3. The screen freezes and the window closes after a few seconds (at which point it becomes unresponsive)
Additional information:
I have not checked whether the same symptom occurs in Linux, and it occurs in all versions of 8.0.0 for Windows.
