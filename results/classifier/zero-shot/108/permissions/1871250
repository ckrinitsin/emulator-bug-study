Failed to create HAX VM

Hi,

I'm running the latest (master) of QEMU, though the version doesn't seem to matter - I also checked back to v4.2.0, exactly the same issue. And this isn't about the VM (guest), if I even just try to run,

> "c:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe" -accel hax

Basically, just get a window to open, with acceleration enabled ... I get,
Open the vm device error:/dev/hax_vm/vm00, ec:3
Failed to open vm 0
Failed to create HAX VM
No accelerator found.

But I checked - I have installed Intel HAXM, and verified it's running,
> sc query intelhaxm
SERVICE_NAME: intelhaxm
        TYPE               : 1  KERNEL_DRIVER
        STATE              : 4  RUNNING
                                (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0

Just remove the accelerator (-accel hax), and I get a window - so this is related to QEMU being able to contact / use the accelerator.

Help!?!?

Thanks!

I am also seeing this. It was working as of commit d649689a8ecb2e276cc20d3af6d416e3c299cb17 so something must have changed in the past month. I can't see anything HAX-related though.

I've bisected this back to b319df553707a3d44c7d027a5d5562f672a768a9, which is odd because it's a merge commit about PowerPC. Perhaps I lost my way somewhere or perhaps there's something hiding in here that breaks it. I wasn't able to revert it in a hurry. I'll have a closer look later.

Hi,

I received an email yesterday (content below) - and it worked! Not sure why it's not here also (and why only via email), but let me share, hope this helps! And BTW, when I say worked ... I applied this to the latest master (locally), addreses the issue. So add this in to the master (formally)?

Thanks!

================================

at the moment you need this patch at
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-03/msg06831.html

But I can't see why v4.2.0 doesn't work on your system. The bug was introduced later.

> Basically, just get a window to open, with acceleration enabled ... I

> 0 Failed to create HAX VM No accelerator found.

ec:3 is ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND


Thanks, that does indeed work for me too! Sorry for the confusion there, apparently merge commits play havoc with git bisect. I also thought it was strange that 4.2.0 didn't work for you as my last working commit came after that.

No worries! And my apologies for some confusion too - I was trying v4.2.0 from the official (recent) downloads, and I think something wasn't quite right ... so I went back, manually built a clean v4.2.0. It worked, as you suspected.

Good news is - seems we know the fix. Fast, and quite minor ... doesn't get better than that. LOL! How to get this in the formal / official code?

Thanks!

It looks like it's been queued for merging already.

Awesome - thanks! I admit, not sure how you see the queue, but if you say it's there, I trust you :-).

Any sort of LE?

Thanks again.

Just going by https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-03/msg06882.html.

That makes sense, thanks!

Do we leave this open until that "hits" (gets pulled in), or close it out? I'm fine with either, whatever you prefer.

Appreciate all the help!

Wait, just in case, I guess. I'm just a lowly user here.

NP, will do. Thanks again for the help!
