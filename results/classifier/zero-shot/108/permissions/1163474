qemu mount usb permission denied 

I use debian with kde and the new Qemu 14.0 . I use this Qemu start arguments: 

/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -monitor stdio -smp 2 -soundhw es1370,ac97 -k de -enable-kvm -m 4096 -localtime -cdrom /dev/sr0 -hda /home/....../.aqemu/Windows_7_x64_HDA.img -boot once=d,menu=off -net nic,vlan=0 -net user,vlan=0 -usb -usbdevice tablet -device usb-host,hostbus=1,hostaddr=2 -device usb-host,hostbus=2,hostaddr=2 -name "Windows 7 x64"

Then I get this error: /dev/bus/usb/000/001: Permission denied 

Some says I must change the permissions /dev/bus/usb to 777 but I think that can't be the solution and when I restart the changes are lost. I think there is also a problem with the automount in KDE. 

The user user who starts Qemu has also full access to usb device (member of the group plugdev)

Triaging old bug tickets ... Sounds like this was rather a problem with your distro / udev than with qemu. In case you still have the problem, please report it to the Debian bug tracker first.
