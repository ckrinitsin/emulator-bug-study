curl and wget segfaults when link has redirects

Hello,

I've been using qemu-user-static with aarch64 docker images and faced the problem
using binares from the following release: https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static/releases/tag/v5.0.0-2.

curl and wget fails with segmentation fault when trying to fetch something from the link
that has some redirects.

In order to reproduce you can run the following:

1) Register qemu on x86_64 machine
   docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
2) Run arm64v8 docker image and try to run wget or curl
   docker run --rm -it arm64v8/ubuntu bash
   $ apt update
   $ apt install curl wget
   $ curl -L http://erratique.ch/software/astring/releases/astring-0.8.3.tbz
   $ wget  http://erratique.ch/software/astring/releases/astring-0.8.3.tbz

This error cannot be reproduced with binaries from eariler release https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static/releases/tag/v4.2.0-7.
curl and wget work fine with the given link and don't fail with segfault when using
older qemu-user-static binaries

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
