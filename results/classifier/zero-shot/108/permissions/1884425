MIPS64EL emu hangs at reboot

QEMU Release version: 5.0.50 (v5.0.0-1411-g26bf4a2921-dirty)

Full command line: qemu-system-mips64el -hda nt4svr.qcow2 -M magnum -L . -global ds1225y.filename=nvram  -global ds1225y.size=8200 -net nic -net user -cdrom en_winnt_4.0_svr.iso

Host machine: Windows 10 1909 64-bit, QEMU running under WSL with the latest Kali distro and the latest Xming.

Guest machine: MIPS64EL Magnum machine, no OS needs to be installed to reproduce - just change some stuff in the Setup program and try to exit

Note: Custom ROM with Windows NT support used, NTPROM.RAW used from http://hpoussineau.free.fr/qemu/firmware/magnum-4000/setup.zip

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days (otherwise it will get
closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate the ticket auto-
matically to the new system.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
