[bugfix incl.] Solaris Debuggers Panic OS with "Nonparity Synchronous Error"
Description of problem:
General use of a debugger (mdb, adb, gdb), such as single-stepping, causing a breakpoint to trigger, and/or simply running a program will cause a kernel panic of "Nonparity Synchronous Error" on many versions of Solaris / SunOS.

This a well reported issue.
