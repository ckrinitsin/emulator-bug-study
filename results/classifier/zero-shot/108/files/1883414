Cannot build qemu-5.0.0 from tarball

Cannot build qemu 5.0.0 from the release tarball. Building from git-clone succeeds.

After downloading and unpacking the 5.0.0 tarball, I typed the following:

mkdir build
cd build
../configure

Then got the following error message:

ERROR: missing file /home/uri/qemu-5.0.0/ui/keycodemapdb/README

This is not a GIT checkout but module content appears to
be missing. Do not use 'git archive' or GitHub download links
to acquire QEMU source archives. Non-GIT builds are only
supported with source archives linked from:

  https://www.qemu.org/download/#source

Developers working with GIT can use scripts/archive-source.sh
if they need to create valid source archives.

It appears the ui/keycodemapdb is missing some files that are obtained from a git submodule in a git tree.

Building from a git clone succeeds.

Where did you download the tarball from?

I just tried it again it didn't reproduce - all files were there. I don't have the original tarball that caused me to open this bug, as I just moved to git clone and continued with that.

Appologies and please close this bug.

I can confirm this bug. I've got this tarball : https://github.com/qemu/qemu/archive/refs/tags/v5.2.0.zip

and then I've unpacked it on /opt and then I did :

./configure --prefix=/opt/qemu-5.2.0 --target-list=aarch64-softmmu,arm-softmmu --enable-guest-agent --enable-vnc --enable-vnc-jpeg --enable-vnc-png --enable-kvm --enable-spice --enable-sdl --enable-gtk --enable-virglrenderer --enable-opengl

Using './build' as the directory for build output

ERROR: missing file /opt/qemu-5.2.0/ui/keycodemapdb/README

You say "I've got this tarball : https://github.com/qemu/qemu/archive/refs/tags/v5.2.0.zip"

You get an error message, and the message says:

"Do not use 'git archive' or GitHub download links to acquire QEMU source archives".

So, like it says, don't do that, go get your tarball from the QEMU website.
