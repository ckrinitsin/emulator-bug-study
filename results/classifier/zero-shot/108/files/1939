Description of problem:

Qemu master git fails to compile under MacOs M1/2, I already tested it with "git-bisect" "git bisect good" and "git bisect bad".All dependencies for qemu are fulfilled and were installed using Homebrew under MacOs.It fails with these commits:

Additional information:
Older sources Qemu 8.1 can be compiled without problems. The only thing that has changed is that I did a major system update and Xcode was also updated. Since then compiling on qemu master version 8.1.50 breaks.
