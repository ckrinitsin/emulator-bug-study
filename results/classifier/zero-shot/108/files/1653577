Ability to set umask for 9pfs

We should be able to specify the umask for 9pfs so that files created by the guest can be accessed by other users on the host. Currently they're only accessible by the user running qemu (and of course, root).

Cannot this be addressed by adjusting the umask in the host before starting QEMU ? And maybe also by adjusting the umask inside the guest if using the "passthrough" or "none" security model of the "local" fsdev backend ?
