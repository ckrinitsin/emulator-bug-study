files on microsoft iso images mounted to qemu VM  get stripped  from Version info. E.G. Microsoft UAG installation fails

QEMU 0.9.0-0.14.1
KVM 60-88-0.14.1
there is a reference for a root cause, why installation of Microsoft UAG fails.

when checking available information on the mounted UAG ISO in my qemu machine, I realized simliar reduced information.
this was found:
using AQEMU 0.8.2 of 2011.07.27

using QEMU 0.9.0-0.14.1 and KVM 60-88-0.14.1
in an KVM managed  machine

Can you still reproduce this problem wit the latest release of QEMU (currently version 2.9.0), or could we close this bug nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
