qemu segfault error when using pcie to dual pci adapter

All the information I have is located in the Unraid forum on post "https://forums.unraid.net/topic/78545-internal-error-qemu-unexpectedly-closed-the-monitor"
I am happy to provide any addition information requested. Please let me know. Reporting bug here based on recommendation by admin in that forum.

hmm that's a fun board.

It looks like qemu has segfaulted;
   1) is this a qemu build you built yourself? If so, exactly which version, built on which distro?
   2) Could you get a backtrace of qemu crashing  - this might be easiest if your distro records core dumps somewhere.

FYI: I was happy to find the board and I'm hopeful to get it working. My goal is to use old hardware to make a retro gaming machine for my girls to play games I used to play growing up.

1)No its the qemu installed with unraid version 6.6.7, which i believe is qemu 3.0
2)im willing to get any notes, logs, or dumps you wish. I just need to know how to do it.

I don't know anything about unraid unfortunately; so I suggest you go back to their forums and ask how to get the backtrace.

I have requested additional info in the other forum. While I wait on reply there, i will say, since you dont know it well, that Unraid is a disto built on top of slackware. Are there any basic command line commands that i could run to get the output you requested, or something to keep things moving while i wait on additional info from the other forum.

Hi! Did you ever get a backtrace? ... otherwise I think we have to close this ticket due to insufficient data...

No I never did. I reached out to try and get info on how to run or get a backtrack and never heard anything. I finally gave up and ended up selling the computer since I never got it working how I wanted to.

Ok, thanks for getting back. So I'm closing this now due to insufficient data.
