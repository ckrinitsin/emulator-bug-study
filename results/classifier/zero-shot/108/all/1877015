virtio only support packed ring size power of 2

Issue discription：
When QEMU starts with "-device virtio-net-pci,netdev=netdev0,mac=52:54:00:00:00:01,disable-modern=false,mrg_rxbuf=on,rx_queue_size=1025,tx_queue_size=1025,mq=on,vectors=15,packed=on"

It raises error: Invalid rx_queue_size (= 1025), must be a power of 2 between 256 and 1024

Analysis:
According to virtio1.1 spec, the packed queue size value does not have to be a power of 2.

Maybe the virtio need to be revised?

Thank you for your reply. I think the code should add the handling for packed ring size to follow the spec.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
