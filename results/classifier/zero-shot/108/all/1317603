qemu-system-ppc does not terminate on VM exit

When a VM is created for a p4080-e500mc  ; the VM can not be  rebooted or terminated.

The qemu-system-ppc process must be killed.

What do you mean by "cannot be rebooted"?  When you log into the guest and type "reboot", nothing happens?  Does init call reboot(2) and the kernel ignores it?  All of userspace is properly terminated, and kernel hangs at the actual reboot?

qemu-system-ppc never terminates.

 John.

Assuming you are using the same scripts as in the other bugs, you are passing
-no-shutdown to qemu, asking it to not exit when the guest exits.  If you
want qemu to exit when the guest is done, then please remove that flag, and
see if that fixes it.

If you are then manually killing qemu before the guest is done running, that
would also explain why the guest fs is corrupted.


It does not change the the behaviour.
With or without those options the VM qemu-system-ppc session never exits.

 John.

I've uploaded a build of today's qemu git HEAD to https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-virt/+archive/virt-daily-upstream .  Would it be possible to test with that?  I assume you'll need to grab the source and re-build packages for ppc.

I am no longer working on this project,

Looking at comment #7, it sounds like you're not interested in this ticket anymore, so I'm closing it as "Won't fix". Feel free to open it again if you are still interested in this.

[Expired for qemu (Ubuntu) because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
