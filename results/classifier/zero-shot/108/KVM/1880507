VMM from Ubuntu 20.04 does not show the memory consumption

KVM host system: Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04, guest machines: Windows and Ubuntu. Management through Ubuntu 20.04, vmm does not show RAM consumption for Windows guest systems (Win7, Win2008R2), for Ubuntu values are shown. The error is not observed in Ubuntu 18.04/vmm.

Does "vmm" mean Virtual Machine Manager (aka virt-manager)? If yes,
please file this bug against the virt-manager package instead of qemu.

Thanks!
