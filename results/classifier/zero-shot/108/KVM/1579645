 [XEN/KVM] pch audio doesn't work on both Windows and linux guest with soundhw="ac97"

Environment:

when try to boot a guest by qemu with parameter "-soundhw ac97", it showed like below:
"audio: Could no init “oss” audio driver.",
then login the guest and try run audio, no sound output.
Reproduce:
1. kvm: qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 2048 -smp 4 -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net tap,script=/etc/kvm/qemu-ifup -soundhw ac97 -hda [target.img]
   xen: add the audio device in guest configure file by soundhw="ac97", xl create $guest-configure
2. it will show "audio: Could no init “oss” audio driver".
3. login in guest, it can detect audio device, but actually it is not working.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
