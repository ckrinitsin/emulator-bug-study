Network device cannot communicate with host machine

I know this used to work but it doesnt work any more using qemu 1.4.2  on fedora 19 everything works fine
except when i add a NIC sharing the main interface from the host (not the virtual network)

the hosts ip is 10.0.0.4, the router is 10.0.0.1 so when i boot my virtual machine it gets an ip from the router no problem 
i get on the internet fine, and i can connect (ping,ftp, samba whatever) to all the computers on the network except the host
10.0.0.4 i can't ping it, i cant do anything to it, but i can connect to all the other computers on the network and i know i used to be able to do this because thats how i shared files between the host and windows guest, with samba... but now i can't browse the host computer because it can't communicate... please help.

Triaging old bug tickets ... How did you start QEMU here? Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU?
