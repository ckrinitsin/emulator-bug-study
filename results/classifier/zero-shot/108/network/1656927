Network (TCP) access regression

Starting a VM with

/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -machine pc-i440fx-1.7,accel=kvm -usb -usbdevice tablet -usbdevice keyboard -enable-kvm -cpu core2duo -smp 2 -drive file=winp
ro.qcow,index=0,media=disk,format=qcow2 -m 4096 -vga vmware -vnc :3 -k en-us -device rtl8139,netdev=nic1 -netdev user,id=nic1,smb=/data/vps/files/,hostfw
d=tcp::10053-:10053,hostfwd=tcp::3387-:3389 -rtc base=utc,clock=host -daemonize

in 2.5.1, all works fine

in any version after 2.5.1.1, the network terminate TCP connections after a certain period .

To reproduce, starts an app that use always connected TCP sockets (I am using Metatrader 4), let it run a an hour, the app does not realize the TCP is out of order but the TCP connection is closed by QEMU

in 2.5.1.x, Metatrader works perfectly

Thank you for your help

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
