USB ECM network device does not work under XHCI
Description of problem:
No data is ever received by the USB ECM network device when it is attached to an XHCI controller. (USB 1.0 controllers work OK.)
Additional information:
There are some patches it appears were submitted to the GitHub mirror that resolve the problem (I tested them applied to git master, and confirmed they work): https://github.com/qemu/qemu/pull/100

I guess they never were submitted to the mailing list, or somehow got missed?
