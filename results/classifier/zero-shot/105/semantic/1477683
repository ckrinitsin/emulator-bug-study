FPU in qemu-system-i386 works incorrectly

FPU bug in qemu-system-i386 makes software which use floating point numbers work incorrectly. For instance, the one included in attachment prints out 0 instead of 2147483648. The same code works ok in qemu-system-x86_64.

I have this issue in QEMU 2.3.0 on two different x86 guests (Parabola GNU/Linux-libre and libreCMC).



I think, that I have the same issue. After some git bisect, I found out that commit ea32aaf1a72af102b855317b47a22e75ac2965a9 has introduced the problem. Attached is a patch that fixes the issue for me. Maybe you can try this out, too.

Thanks! That patch solves the issue for me. May I ask maintainer to commit the fix?

Someone has posted a similar fix a few weeks ago, and it has just been merged.

Great, thanks for the information. I was just about to send the patch to the mailing list, but this seems to unnecessary now.

If I've got that right, the fix had been included here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=178846bdd93994c1acaf
... so closing this ticket now.
