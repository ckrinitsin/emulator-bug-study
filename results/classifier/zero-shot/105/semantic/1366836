Core2Duo and KVM may not boot Win8 properly on 3.x kernels

When I start up QEMU w/ KVM 1.7.0 on a Core2Duo machine running a vanilla kernel
3.4.67 or 3.10.12 to run a Windows 8.0 guest, the guest freezes at Windows 8 boot without any error.
When I dump the CPU registers via "info registers", nothing changes, that means
the system really stalled. Same happens with QEMU 2.0.0 and QEMU 2.1.0.

But - when I run the very same guest using Kernel 2.6.32.12 and QEMU 1.7.0 or 2.0.0 on
the host side it works on the Core2Duo. Also the system above but just with an
i3 or i5 CPU it works fine.

I already disabled networking and USB for the guest and changed the graphics
card - no effect. I assume that some mean bits and bytes have to be set up
properly to get the thing running.

Seems to be related to a kvm/progressor incompatibility.

Here the register dump of the stalled Win8
QEMU 2.1.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information

I found a new trace - using the ipipe patch that I have, there seems to be an issue in the 3.4 kernels, but as it looks also in the 3.10 kernels.
http://www.xenomai.org/pipermail/xenomai/2013-March/027865.html

Is there an update on that already existing? It was not completely clear if this issue is related either to KVM or to the ipipe patch.

Thanks.

attached the trace.dat (tar-gzipped) as recommended. Hope this helps finding the issue. The file should capture the following:
- windows 8 with screen that shows that the last boot attempts failed
- issued system_reset on qemu commandline
- startup of windows 8 that stalls


sorry for the corrupt file, this one should be fine now.

Confirmed - the current kvm.git without any ipipe patch also causes the issue. Trace File attached.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Please close it, it's solved with this patch commit to kvm / kernel:
Was found and fixed with great support of Paolo Bonzini
