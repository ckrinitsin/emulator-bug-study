RISC-V priviledged instruction error

Hello when performing an MRET with MPP set to something else than 0b11 in MSTATUS, 'Invalid Instruction' exception will be triggered. The problem appeared in code after version 5.2.0.

<pre>
  # setup interrupt handling for monitor mode
  la t0, entry_loop
  la t1, entry_trap
  li t2, 0x888
  li t3, 0x1880 # MPP in MSTATUS selects to which mode to return & MPIE selects if to enable interrupts after MRET
  csrw mepc, t0
  csrw mtvec, t1
  csrs mie, t2
  csrs mstatus, t3

  # if supervisor mode not supported, then loop forever
  csrr t0, misa
  li t1, 0x40000
  and t2, t1, t0
  beqz t2, 1f

  # setup interrupt i& exception delegation for supervisor mode
  li t0, 0xc0000000 # 3 GiB (entry address of supervisor)
  li t1, 0x1000
  #li t2, 0x300 # bit 8 & 9 is for ecall from user & supervisor mode
  #li t3, 0x222
  csrw mepc, t0
  csrc mstatus, t1
  #csrs medeleg, t2
  #csrs mideleg, t3

  # pass mhartid as first parameter to supervisor
  csrr a0, mhartid

I'm guessing that this is a bug in your guest as it hasn't configured PMP regions.

From the RISC-V spec:

"
If no PMP entry matches an M-mode access, the access succeeds. If no PMP entry matches an
S-mode or U-mode access, but at least one PMP entry is implemented, the access fails.
"

Confusingly implemented here means implemented in hardware, not just configured.

You can check this by reverting this QEMU commit:

    target/riscv/pmp: Raise exception if no PMP entry is configured
    
    As per the privilege specification, any access from S/U mode should fail
    if no pmp region is configured.

Hello Francis,

I'll configure PMP than do the test again. Sorry I hadn't understood what
changed between version 5.2 and 6.0-rc2, since my code worked before.

Best regards,
Teodori Serge

We fixed a bug to make QEMU act more like hardware, which now means that PMP must be configured in M-mode.

Hello Francis,

Yes thank you. I added code to setup a basic PMP and it works now. Thank
you and best regards,

Teodori Serge
