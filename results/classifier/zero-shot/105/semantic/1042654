Floppy disks and network not working on NT 3.1 on Qemu 1.2 rc1

When I try to put Floppy IMG/IMA/VFD images on NT 3.1 when it is running on Qemu 1.2 rc, they are not recognized and the network is not working even though I set it correctly (especially the AMD PCnet adapter)
Here's some screenshot of the floppy error:

Thanks for testing qemu 1.2-rc!

Can you confirm that both floppy and AMD PCnet worked in QEMU 1.1?

If so, could you please try running git-bisect(1) to identify which
commit introduced the breakage?

$ git clone git://git.qemu.org/qemu.git
$ cd qemu
$ git bisect start v1.2-rc1 v1.1.0

they worked in Qemu 1.1 and also in the previous versions and, by the way, I can't compile, I used a third party Win32 build of Qemu 1.2 rc1. :(

Have you tried any other guest operating systems?  If there is a more
readily available guest OS that shows the same bug it would allow
others to reproduce and debug this.

it does not happen on NT 3.5, 3.51 or 4.0, only on 3.1.

Found someone who had a copy of NT 3.1 handy and he bisected it to:

commit 2fee00885a9ea4db69bbfc1ba8ccf95f2ae9aec6

    fdc: fix interrupt handling
    
    If you call the SENSE INTERRUPT STATUS command while there is no interrupt
    waiting you get as result unknown command.
    
    Fixed status0 register handling for read/write/format commands.

nice :) but what about the network?

It appears that the fdc issue were addressed in this patch series:

 http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/168836

Unfortunately the URL from comment #7 is dead nowadays ... has this fix been committed to the QEMU repository?

The floppy fix appears to be commit 34abf9a7 (contained in qemu 1.3).

I don't think anyone ever looked into the networking problem.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
