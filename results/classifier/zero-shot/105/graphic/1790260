binfmt support not working for x86 host and x86_64 guest

this is a problem in the qemu-binfmt-conf.sh script and maybe somewhere else. the version i checked is the current github mirror https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/scripts/qemu-binfmt-conf.sh

i am running linux mint 19 32bit on a 32bit x86 cpu and i want to run some applications that are only available as x86_64 packages. i use multiarch and qemu and it works for simple applications like cacafire. however i want to run the application natively from the shell without having to use qemu-x86_64 <path>. i also installed the binfmt-support package. when i run update-binfmts --display then an extry for x86_64 is missing and transparent execution is not working. 

the problem seems to be in the qemu-binfmt-conf.sh script. it disables the creation of entries for cpus of the same family. this is not a problem if you are using a 64bit cpu because 32bit binaries run on it natively but it doesnt work in the opposite way. hacking line 310 to

         if [ "$cpu" = "x86_64" ] || [ "$host_family" != "$family" ] ; then

and running it with the --systemd ALL parameter causes a x86_64 config file to be created. it still doesnt work but that might have different causes.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
