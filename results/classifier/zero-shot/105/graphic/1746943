qemu-aarch64-static: qemu: uncaught target signal 11 for ps/top cmd

In a docker container created from an aarch64 image, injects qemu-aarch64-static (in /usr/bin)
  run ps/top cmd  inside this container

  reports "qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault)"

Tried qemu-aarch64-static from fedora 27 / ubuntu artful / debian unstable (i.e. qemu version 2.10 - 2.11)

The aarch64 dock image is fedora 27(and with qemu-aarch64-static Fedora 27), hence I opened a related bug here https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1541252

I tried psproc-ng from https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/procps/2:3.3.12-1ubuntu2/+build/10452812

No SEGV, I guess it may be a CRASH-PATH which is triggered in this specific scenario

I've did update in redhat bugzilla #1541252, and wait for confirming above.

BTW, "uncaught target signal 11" makes it hard to figure out "how this SEGV happened"

Could you provide instructions to reproduce that don't require Fedora or docker, please?


Still waiting for repro instructions (eg attaching a binary that doesn't run under QEMU).


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
