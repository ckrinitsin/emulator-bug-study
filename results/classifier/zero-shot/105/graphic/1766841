QEMU 2.12 Running Problem in Windows 7 Installation

QEMU Version: 2.12 (Binary installer qemu-w64-setup-20180424.exe  from Stefan Weil's website so I am not sure I should report it to Weil by email or by this bug report system.)
Host System: Windows 7 64bit
Guest System: 9front 6350 (Codename“CONTENTS, MAINTAINED, STABLE”, Release 2018/02/02)

QEMU Command:
qemu-system-x86_64 -usb -device usb-mouse -hda plan9.qcow2.img -cdrom 9front-6350.iso -boot d

QEMU warning: 
(qemu-system-x86_64.exe:8844): GdkPixbuf-WARNING **: Cannot open pixbuf loader module file 'D:\qemu\lib\gdk-pixbuf-2.0\2.10.0\loaders.cache': No such file or directory

This likely means that your installation is broken.
Try running the command
  gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders > D:\qemu\lib\gdk-pixbuf-2.0\2.10.0\loaders.cache
to make things work again for the time being.

(qemu-system-x86_64.exe:8844): Gtk-WARNING **: Could not find the icon 'window-minimize-symbolic-ltr'. The 'hicolor' theme was not found either, perhaps you need to install it.

CCing Stefan Weil in case he hasn't seen this yet.

Both messages are warnings – QEMU will work nevertheless.

The first warning can be fixed as the message says (that needs an additional installation of Cygwin for gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders). It is also suppressed if there is an empty file loaders.cache. Newer installers (for example those from today) will create such an empty file automatically.

I don't get the second warning.

Rechecked in my site, the new installer (20180430) had solved the 1st problem, but it leads to another problem: When uninstall QEMU, the loaders.cache file cannot be deleted automatically.

For 2nd warning, I checked it again, when I choosed fully installing, the icons are displayed correctly; But when I just installed the x64 & x64w simulator, the icons are lost and the 2nd warning message shown. It seems some dependent file is not installed when performing a selected installation.

I discovered that the following directory is not installed when the "Desktop icons" component is unchecked during installation:

    qemu\share\icons

Such directory contains two subdirectories: "Adwaita" and "hicolor". When they're present, the bug does not occur.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
