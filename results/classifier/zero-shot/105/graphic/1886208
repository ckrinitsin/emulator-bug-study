[Feature request] Haiku VM image

We already have handy VMs to build QEMU within:

$ git grep -l basevm.BaseVM
tests/vm/centos
tests/vm/fedora
tests/vm/freebsd
tests/vm/netbsd
tests/vm/openbsd
tests/vm/ubuntu.i386

With David Carlier recent work, we can build QEMU on Haiku OS:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-07/msg01241.html

To avoid bitrots it would be useful to have a Haiku VM.

Haiku image has been included now:
