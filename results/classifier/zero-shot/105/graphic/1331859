QEMU kernel panic on Windows with arithmetic syntax error

During attempts to bring-up QEMU 64-bit ARM support I discovered a kernel panics that only occur on Windows but work properly on Linux.

The issue can be reproduced by running the following command line:

$ ./arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -kernel $IMAGES/vmlinuz-3.2.0-4-versatile -initrd $IMAGES/initrd.img-3.2.0-4-versatile -hda $IMAGES/debian_wheezy_armel_standard.qcow2 -append "root=/dev/sda1"

where $IMAGES is the location where the images are downloaded from http://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/armel/.

This was reproduced with both a custom built QEMU as well as the QEMU image installed by http://qemu.weilnetz.de/w32/qemu_w32-setup-20140617.exe.

The same command line runs properly on Linux using a custom built QEMU.

The Windows versions of QEMU do appear to work properly using the arm-test images available on qemu.org.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
