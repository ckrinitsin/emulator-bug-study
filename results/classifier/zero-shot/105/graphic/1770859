qemu-img compare -m option is missing

Comparing images using multiple streams (like qemu-img convert) maybe effectively sped up when one of the images (or both) is RBD. qemu-img convert does it's job perfectly while converting. Please implement the same for image comparison. Since operations are read-only, -W is useless, but may be introduced as well for debugging/performance purposes.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
