Curses Keyboard Broken On OS X

Whenever I run ``qemu-system-i386 -curses ...'' (with or without a ``-k en-gb'') on OS X 10.9, the keyboard does not work properly. For example, when attempting to switch to the QEMU console with Alt+2, I get:

``Warning: no scancode found for keysym 226
Warning: no scancode found for keysym 130
Warning: no scancode found for keysym 172''

I have checked and these scancodes are not mentioned in ``share/qemu/keymaps/''.

EDIT: I should have mentioned that this is using QEMU 1.6.1, but the problem also occurs with 1.3.1. Also, in case it makes a difference, I installed QEMU using Homebrew.

Does the problem still occur with the latest version of QEMU (currently v2.8)?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

Yes, I can still reproduce this with 2.8.0, and it gives exactly the same output.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
