windows7 reboot bluesreen 0x0000005c

I have met sevaral blue screen with 0x0000005c(0x0000010b,0x00000003,0x00000000,0x00000000) after windows7 reboot.
It always happens just before the windows iron animation appears.

my qemu version is qemu-2.1.0
my guest os is windows7 32bits sp1

my qemu commandline is 
./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -hda system.inst -spice port=5940,disable-ticketing -monitor stdio --enable-kvm

This bug  doesn't happen always，and i don‘t know how to reproduce it.

But i have a special way to produce such a bluescreen.
I set nmi dump on and set windows to collect dump file and set auto reboot after system fail on. 
Then i send a nmi to guest, and then after collecting dump file , windows will auto reboot and then such a blue screen happens.
And this can be  reproduced always.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
