qcow2 image converted from Photon OS can't be started

Steps to reproduce the issue:
1. Download the ovf from this place:
https://bintray.com/vmware/photon/download_file?file_path=photon-custom-hw10-1.0-62c543d.ova
2. Extract vmdk from ova file.
3. Convert from vmdk fromat to qcow2 via qeum-img
4. Launch the qcow2 image. The VM is started. But there is no any output. CPU usage is 100%

I try this steps and meet the similar issue:
1. Deploy a VM in ESXi from https://bintray.com/vmware/photon/download_file?file_path=photon-custom-hw10-1.0-62c543d.ova
2. Copy vmdk and flat.vmdk file
3. Convert from vmdk format to raw via qeum-img(qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O raw Photon.vmdk Photon.raw)
4. Launch the qcow2 image. The VM is started. And the splash screen is showed. But then there is no any output.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Additional question if this is still relevant: How did you run QEMU here, i.e. which command line parameters did you use?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
