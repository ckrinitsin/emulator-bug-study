Host system crashes on qemu with DMA remapping

Hy,

the host system crashes completely, when i try to pass an physical device without boot option intel_iommu=on set. In older kernel versions you didn't have to pass that option.

I wonder if this can be easily checked by asking iommu state, avoiding a crash of the complete system.

My data:
cpu model: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU
qemu version: 2.4.1-r2
kernel version: 4.1.2 x86_64
command line: 
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -drive file=/vms/prod/fw/fw.iso,if=virtio,format=raw -drive file=/vms/prod/fw/swap,if=virtio,format=raw -drive file=/vms/prod/fw/fwdata.iso,if=virtio,format=raw -m 512 -nographic -kernel /data/kernels/vmlinuz-2.6.36-gentoo-r8 -append "root=/dev/vda console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=serial" -net nic,model=virtio,macaddr=DE:AD:BE:EF:2D:AD -net tap,ifname=tapfw0,script=/etc/qemu/qemu-ifup -device pci-assign,host=03:00.0

Thanks,
Antonios.

Sorry, i have to cancel this report.

The problem seems to be somewhere else. After some reboots the same issue came up again.

Triaging old bug tickets ... Can you still reproduce the issue with the latest version of QEMU and the kernel, or could we close this bug nowadays?
