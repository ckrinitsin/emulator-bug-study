Hard disk images are supporting ATAPI commands. They should fail.

When using a hard disk image (qcow, qcow2, vdi, vmdk, bochs), the emulated device can be a CD-ROM and support ATAPI commands.

These commands fails in real hard disks and these images are not prepared to handle optical disk formats, they should fail also.

Only images able to handle that formats (dmg, raw, host) should work with ATAPI commands and CD-ROM devices.

Looking through old bug tickets ... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU, or could we close this ticket nowadays?
