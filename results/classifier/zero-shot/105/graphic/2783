Cannot install a fresh Windows 7 32-bit guest with Q35 machine type (mouse and keyboard do not function, so cannot continue install)
Description of problem:
When trying to install Windows 7 32-bit via the official SP1 installation ISO, the machine boots the installer, but both keyboard and mouse do not function, so the installation cannot proceed.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Using virt-manager, create a new VM using the x86 version of the Windows 7 SP1 install ISO found here: https://archive.org/details/windows-7-professional-with-sp1-x64-dvd-iso
2. Select `Microsoft Windows 7` as the Operating System type, which uses Q35 as the machine type
3. Click Begin Installation
4. See the Windows 7 installer screen show up
5. Keyboard and mouse inputs don't work at all, mouse cursor also doesn't appear
Additional information:
I've tried using `Microsoft Windows XP` as the Operating System in virt-manager, which switches to i440FX as the machine type, and the issue doesn't appear: keyboard and mouse both work perfectly. But of course, it would be nice to use Q35 instead to get USB 3.0, PCI-E, etc.

Notice the lack of cursor in the screenshot above on Q35.

When using a i440FX machine, the white Windows cursor will appear:
