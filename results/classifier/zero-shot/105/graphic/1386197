keyboard suddenly stops working in VM and problem persists until host reboot. All super-standard setup no funny stuff

QEMU emulator version 2.1.2, Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard
Linux HOST 3.16.3-1-ck #1 SMP PREEMPT Sun Sep 21 11:27:46 CEST 2014 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I already had this with ubanto VM so I installed a centos one but then I type HDD password in VNC suddenly keyboard stops working forever. Kill qemu, stop qemu, start again ... same issue. Very strange. Problem in VNC, problem in vga std problem in spicec problem with options problem without options, SDL no SDL and nothing helps. dmesg only shows unhandled wrmsr like always .. so irrelevant. 

Must be problem with new kernel or nvidia driver mystery magic I suppose? But I had riced CK kernel before and no issue. Hardware didn't change. Nothing works, what is this? Can do sendkey 1 1 in console no issue. So why is all keyboard input dead in mid-operation? You see after reboot I open VM and no matter what VNC or spicec or SDL I input keyboard all normal then this! BAM all keyboard input gone! So in ubuntu I still had mouse so I used onscreen keyboard to enable SSH and then I didn't care. But now I have harddrive password, what can I do? Install different QEMU but I suppose problem with new kernel xorg stuff rather ... Can't change that! Help much appreciated.

So installed qemu-git 2.2.r35796.gff0d487-1 from AUR shows up as QEMU emulator version 2.1.50, Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard no host system reboot but still exact same ... no wait! 

Now I see this: I can press all the printable character keys except 0-9 A-Z :space: and KP_keys so basically just -=[]\;',./` . Cheated myself into grub edit mode with sendkey now I test it and yes it is like that no shift no ESC no insert, delete, etc just those keys. What is this?! I am not sure but I think the bug was always like this I just didn't bother about the -=[]\;',./` keys.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
