configure script breaks when $source_path contains white spaces

Hi,

I noticed that the configure script breaks when the qemu source directory is in a path containing white spaces, in particular the list of targets is not correctly generated when calling "./configure --help".

Steps to reproduce the problem:

$ mkdir "dir with spaces"
$ cd dir\ with\ spaces/
$ git clone https://git.qemu.org/git/qemu.git
$ cd qemu/
$ ./configure --help | grep -A3 target-list


Actual result:

  --target-list=LIST       set target list (default: build everything)
                           Available targets: dir with *-softmmu dir with 
                           *-linux-user


Expected result:

  --target-list=LIST       set target list (default: build everything)
                           Available targets: aarch64-softmmu alpha-softmmu 
                           arm-softmmu cris-softmmu hppa-softmmu i386-softmmu 
                           lm32-softmmu m68k-softmmu microblaze-softmmu 


This happens because the $mak_wilds variable uses spaces to separate different paths, maybe newlines may be used, which are less likely to be in directory names.

BTW "shellcheck" may help finding some other problems.

Qemu version:

$ git describe 
v3.1.0-1960-ga05838cb2a

Thanks,
   Antonio

I think it is better to just disallow building in a path containing spaces, -- there are so many packages and other tools that fails in this config, might require lots of work to fix this AND to ensure all future changes are still working, and there's an easy workaround

Just my few cents.

Certainly I bet that the problems with spaces in the path do
not stop with the handling of the target-list help message.
Make does not really get on at all with spaces...
It would probably be helpful if we made configure complain
if it finds spaces in the build or source paths.

I am OK with just checking and complaining.

Linux too solves the problem in this way: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/Makefile?id=51193b76bfff5027cf96ba63effae808ad67cca7

A general "shellcheck" pass wouldn't hurt, tho.

Thank you,
   Antonio

If calling from any Unix shell, and the parameter has spaces, then we need to quote it.we can also use single quotes, these are more powerful. They stop the shell from interpreting anything ($, !, \, *, ", etc, except ').


can't we use this approach here??

Deepika: the tricky part is the makefiles, not the configure script...


Oh~
Okay!
