emacs (gtk3) core dumped with -vga qxl

Emacs (gtk3) exited with bus error and core dumped with -vga qxl. If I use the builtin modesetting xorg driver, emacs could survive for a short while sometimes. If I use xf86-video-qxl (git r587.8babd05), it dies right away with the same error. It seems to corrupt xorg at some point as well, because sometimes I cannot exit i3 properly and gnome-terminal can go crazy afterwards (all letters become empty retangles).

It doesn't seem to happen with other -vga driver.

Error message is attached. Can also provide the core dumped but it's of 47M.

I started the vm as root (sudo) with the following command: qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4G -virtfs local,mount_tag=qemu,security_model=passthrough,path=/mnt/qemu/ -kernel /mnt/qemu/boot/vmlinuz-linux -initrd /mnt/qemu/boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img -append 'rw root=qemu fstype=9p' -usbdevice tablet -vga qxl -spice port=12345,disable-ticketing

/mnt/qemu is a btrfs snapshot of the subvolume used as the host root

Arch Linux, qemu 2.3.0, xorg-server 1.17.1, linux 4.0.4, gtk 3.16.3, glib 2.44.1



Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest versions of QEMU, x11, kernel, spice, etc.? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
