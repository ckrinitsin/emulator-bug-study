Problem with sdl,gl=on windows 10
Description of problem:
sdl window opens with black screen, freezes, then crashes
Steps to reproduce:
1. run the command
Additional information:
- Works fine with just `sdl`, running `gtk,gl=on` outputs `opengl is not supported by the display`
- tried with both `-vga virtio` and `vga std`, same result
- tried with SVM turned on and off (AMD cpu, ryzen 2600x), same result
- built the project `./configure --enable-gtk --enable-sdl --enable-opengl, saw the `OK` for all 3
- have opengl ver 4.6
