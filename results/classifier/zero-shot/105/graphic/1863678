qemu and virtio-vga black screen in Android

QEMU emulator version 4.2.50 

kernel 5.3.0-29-generic
host Ubuntu 19.10
guest: Android 8.1

While trying to compile I get the following error

qemu/slirp/src/misc.c:146: undefined reference to `g_spawn_async_with_fds'

slirp is a separate project now ... if the problem persists, could you please report this in the https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/slirp/libslirp/-/issues bug tracker? Thanks!

I'm closing this now. If the problem still persists, please report it to libslirp instead.
