qemu freezes during grub on arch cloudimg 

When booting the Arch Linux cloud image and setting `-nographic`, qemu will freeze during the grub bootloader.
Tested with qemu 5.1 and 5.2.

Reproduce:
```
wget https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/arch-boxes/-/jobs/20342/artifacts/raw/output/Arch-Linux-x86_64-basic-20210420.20342.qcow2

qemu-system-x86_64 -hda Arch-Linux-x86_64-basic-20210420.20342.qcow2 -nographic

```

It will get stuck while displaying `Welcome to GRUB!`
If -nographic is omitted, it will continue to boot (without any keyboard interaction)

Sorry, this is actually not a qemu problem. The arch system just doesn't display any messages during boot when `-nographic` is used.
The issue can be closed.
