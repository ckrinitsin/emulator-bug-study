qemu-system-i386 does not work

I am using QEMU 2.1.0 on a Slackware 14.1 operating system (with Linux 3.15.8).

I run QEMU like this:
$ qemu-system-i386 slackware-14.1-install-dvd.iso
I have also tested with the "-enable-kvm" and the "-m 1000" options.

And QEMU is does not work.
I mean, after 10 minutes, nothing is displayed on the screen, I am not able to see the Slackware installer.



Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

I have just tested with QEMU 2.10.0 on Slackware 14.2 and Slackware64 14.2.

I run QEMU like this:
$ qemu-system-i386 slackware-14.1-install-dvd.iso

It works perfectly now.
It is fixed.

Thanks for checking it again!
