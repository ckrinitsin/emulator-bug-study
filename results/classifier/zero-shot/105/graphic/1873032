After upgrade qemu to 5.0.0-0.3.rc2.fc33 the virtual machine with Windows 10 after a while starts to work very slowly

Description of problem:

After upgrade qemu to 5.0.0-0.3.rc2.fc33 the virtual machine with Windows 10 after a while starts to work very slowly

I created the virtual machine with Windows 10 with the following config:
- 1 CPU
- 2GB RAM
- With network access

I launch there a web browser there with flash content. 
And usually, the system (Windows 10) does not work there for more than an hour.
When the system starts to work very slowly it doesn't respond to "Reboot" and "Shut Down" commands. Only works "Force Reset" and "Force Off". But when I reboot the system with "Force Reset" it usually stuck at boot at the Windows splash screen. https://imgur.com/yGyacDG

The last version of qemu which not contain this issue is 5.0.0-0.2.rc0.fc33



When VM starts work very slowly System interrupts in Windows Task Manager eats up 99% of all CPU resources.
