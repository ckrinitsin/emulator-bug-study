[git] "qemu-system-x86_64: Parameter 'drive' is missing" when I tried to launch an existing VM in Virt-Manager.
Description of problem:
This bug is related in some way to bug #488.

I cannot start an existing virtual machine using qemu-git.
Additional information:
```

My last working build was made using commit 9bef7ea9. Using Peter Maydell commits as milestone, I noticed commit 9aef0954 was the first showing the bug.

I'll try to do bisect between these two commits and report asap. There is about 40 commits to verify.
