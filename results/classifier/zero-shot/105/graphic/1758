libssh missing on macOS/m1
Description of problem:
I did a "git pull" in my source for qemu. Now when I do "make" I get:
../block/ssh.c:27:10: fatal error: 'libssh/libssh.h' file not found

Am I supposed to install libssh separately? I were able to compile qemu about a month ago or so.
Steps to reproduce:
1.
2.
3.
