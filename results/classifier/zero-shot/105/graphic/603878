[Feature request] qemu-img option about recompressing

Suppose I have a fresh compressed qcow2 image. After some time the data were recorded without compression. I decide to make "QEMU-IMG convert" for that image to reduce its size.

I want a new option, which selects between the two algorithms overdriven images:
1. extract all / compress again when converting images (in the current implementation)
2. compress only uncompressed blocks and just copy the compressed blocks without re-compression.

This option is only needed when converting compressed image to compressed and the compression algorithm is the same.

overdriven=re-compressing
recorded=written


The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
