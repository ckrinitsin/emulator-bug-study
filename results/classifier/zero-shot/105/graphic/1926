Spice: handle_dev_destroy_surface_wait: condition `msg->surface_id == 0' failed (DoS via assert failure)
Description of problem:
Assert failure in libspice-server was found during fuzzing qxl-vga device.

```plaintext
qemu-system-x86_64: Spice: ../server/red-worker.cpp:367:handle_dev_destroy_surface_wait: condition `msg->surface_id == 0' failed
Аварийный останов
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. This bug can be reroduced with 

   ```plaintext
   cat << EOF | ./qemu-system-x86_64 -display none -machine accel=qtest, -m 512M -M \
   pc -nodefaults -vga qxl -qtest stdio
   outl 0xcf8 0x8000101c
   outl 0xcfc 0xc000
   outl 0xcf8 0x80001004
   outw 0xcfc 0x01
   outl 0xc00b 0x01000000
   EOF
   ```
2. This bug is in another place from https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1829, please pay attention to it. It has to be solved, because it interferes with further fuzzing process
Additional information:
As I mentioned, I really need this bug to be solved, because fuzzing qxl-vga device gets less efficient. I suggested to report it here, not in spice-server, because this bug can be on the QEMU side.
