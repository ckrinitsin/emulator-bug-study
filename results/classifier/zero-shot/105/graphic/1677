qemu-system-x86_64 cannot run on Windows when -smp is specified with a value higher than `1`. An important argument for any expectation of VM performance
Description of problem:
qemu-system-x86_64 seems to crash on Windows the moment you try to use -smp to define more vcpus, even the basic usage of `-smp 4` will cause qemu to segfault after the guest's boot option is selected.
Steps to reproduce:
1. `qemu-system-x86_64 -smp 4 -cdrom rhel-9.2-x86_64-dvd.iso -drive if=pflash,format=raw,unit=0,readonly=on,file=edk2-x64/OVMF_CODE.fd -m 6G -nodefaults -serial mon:stdio`
2. Select the boot option to begin your installation
3. qemu hangs for 10 or so seconds then throws a Segmentation Fault.
Additional information:
1. This does not happen if -smp arguments are omitted, but running VMs with a single vcpu thread is slow and painful.
2. This still happens even without OVMF (Traditional bios booting)
3. This still happens even without -defaults and without a serial device

Only output from qemu at death is `Segmentation fault`
