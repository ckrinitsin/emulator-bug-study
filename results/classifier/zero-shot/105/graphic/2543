QEMU UEFI for riscv64 failed to load my DIY bootloader due to unknown reason
Steps to reproduce:
1. [ProblematicBootLoader.zip](/uploads/21fcff0052dc2dd95bf4bba3f6ec8fb8/ProblematicBootLoader.zip) unpack this zipped file,create a fat.img which contains FAT32 file system,and then move the unpacked file in the zip to /EFI/BOOT/bootriscv64.efi.After that using xorriso to pack it.
2. Load the cdrom in libvirt(virt-manager) using SCSI/USB
3. Then wait for seconds and error will show(I don't why STORE_ACCESS_PAGE_FAULT occurs)
Additional information:
My full source code is inÂ https://github.com/TYDQSoft/UEFIPascalOS.

You can get the instruction in the github to compile this problematic bootloader for testing.

x64,AArch64 was tested successfully,but riscv64 is always problematic in evert test times.
