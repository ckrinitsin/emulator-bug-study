slow boot windows 7

Hello,
I have a nice working qemu with gpu passthrough setup.
I pass through my nvidia gtx 880m.
It boots in 4mins 18secs.

If I remove the "-vga none" switch and allow qemu to create a vga adapter I can boot in 1min.

Why does a normal boot with the nvidia card hang for 3mins (yes, the hd light just flickers for that long)?

Nothing major but I'd like to know, especially if it can be fixed.

I cannot leave -vga none turned on as the vga adapter grabs up resources and the nvidia card complains it cannot start due to lack of resources. I'd love to just add resources if possible and keep both cards running to get the 1min boot time.

Here is my script:

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
