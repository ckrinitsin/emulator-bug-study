ps2 keyboard not work after boot and use libspice to connect it
Description of problem:
When I start almost 10 qemu virtual machines, there will always be one or two that have the ps2 keyboard not work well after booted.But I use mstsc to connect to the desktop, the keyboard works fine. But when reboot or migrate it well recovery.
Steps to reproduce:
1.Asynchronously start 40 qemu virtual machines, each with 4 cores and 4 threads

2.there will always be one or two that have the ps2 keyboard not work well.

4.And when i gdb debug it, i found i hang at the func "prepare_mmio_access"

5.reboot or migrate it well recovery
Additional information:
the gdb debug as fllow:

gdb attach $pid 

gdb>b kbd_push_key      //spice input

gdb>b kbd_read_data

gdb>b ps2_keyboard_event

gdb>c

After continue, the code run on ps2_keyboard_event,but no work to "kbd_read_data".This Proves that the keyboard input has been added to the queue, but has not been read from the queue.

gdb> thread 4   //switch to thread "CPU 0/KVM"

gdb> bt

I guess there is no event to notify the device to read after writing to the queue, or is it deadlocked? I'm not sure
