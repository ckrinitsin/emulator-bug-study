8.0.0: Crash when emulating MIPS executable
Description of problem:
A change to QEMU introduced within the 6.0.0 development cycle causes MIPS executable to crash.
Similar problem occurred within the same time-frame for Aarch64 executables, but was fixed.
Patches in QEMU causing both Aarch64 and MIPS occurrences are identified and attached below.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download attached core_test.zip archive.
2. Run pre-built MIPS executable with QEMU.
3. Observe the crash somewhere in tdelete.
4. Source for the test is here: https://github.com/VectorChief/QuadRay-engine
5. The binaries were built with GCC 9.4 cross-compilers using slightly modified makefiles (-ggdb3) for gdb-multiarch
6. Building on Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 23.04 also reproduces the problem, so it's not OS or compiler specific.
