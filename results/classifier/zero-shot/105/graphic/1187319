Ctrl-Alt-- and Ctrl-Alt-+ have no effect in SDL

The manual page mentions Ctrl-Alt-- for shrinking a window and Ctrl-Alt-+ for enlarging it. Pressing these keys do not seem to have any effect.

I tried -/= with and without holding shift and the numpad. By the way, the numpad plus and min do not have any effect in GTK either.

Keyboard layout: US int with AltGr dead keys
version: 1.5.0

Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
