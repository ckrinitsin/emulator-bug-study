Mouse leaves VM window when Grab on Hover isn't selected Windows 10 and Intel HAX

On Windows 10.0.17134 I have been having the problem that the mouse will leave the VM window after a short time when grab on hover isn't selected.  The VM will then try to grab on Hover and the mouse will grab in weird places and it will become very unwieldy to control the mouse in the VM window.

This is exasperated by super slow response making it nearly unusable  if the Intel® Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (Intel® HAXM) is not currently installed on my machine.

I know they are different things but they compounded on each other when you have a mouse that is not staying in the VM window and the VM's visualized cpu is acting VERY slow the system is unusable.

Here is a video demonstrating the main issue. This does not show any lag but, it does show how VM doesn't capture the mouse correctly.

After capture if you move the mouse far enough off the VM window the mouse goes out of the window in odd places that isn't representative of the location of where the mouse is.
The mouse will leave the VM from the middle of the of VM window at times.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
