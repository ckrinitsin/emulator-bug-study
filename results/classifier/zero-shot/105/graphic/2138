Build failure on macOS when using --disable-cocoa
Description of problem:
Build fails:

```
../qemu-8.2.1/meson.build:3741:13: ERROR: No host machine compiler for 'audio/coreaudio.m'
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. On macOS run `./configure --disable-cocoa`

Result:

```
Compiler for language objc skipped: feature cocoa disabled
```
```
../meson.build:3741:13: ERROR: No host machine compiler for 'audio/coreaudio.m'
```
Additional information:
It seems your build script contains the assumption that an Objective-C compiler is not needed when the Cocoa UI is disabled, but it still appears to be needed to compile the CoreAudio code regardless of UI.

This was originally reported to MacPorts here: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/67984
