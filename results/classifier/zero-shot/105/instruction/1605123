PEXT returns wrong values, seemingly switches arguments

Hi,

I fiddled with BMI2 instructions and discovered that pext instructions
emulated with "qemu-x86_64 -cpu Haswell" return the wrong value. It
seemingly switches up its arguments. I suspect that the error is around the
gen_helper_pext(...) call in target-i386/translate.c. I checked helper_pext
in target-i386/int_helper.c and it works fine.

I ran my program on a CPU with BMI2 instruction set too, and it indeed
returns different values.

I didn't check pdep, it could have the same problem.

$ qemu-x86_64 --version

$ uname -a

I compiled the attached file with the command line "gcc -o main -g -mbmi2 main.c".

$ gcc --version
