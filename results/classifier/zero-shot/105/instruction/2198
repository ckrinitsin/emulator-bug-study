Unable to run OS/2 Warp4.52
Description of problem:
Operating system crashes upon boot.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install OS/2 Warp4
2. Apply Fixpack15
3. Try to boot the system
Additional information:
This is a very old bug that seems to render a whole family of Operating Systems (OS/2 Warp4 and eComStation) unusable under Qemu.
Warp4 works, in the sense that it does install and run, but just until it is updated to 4.52 (which is necessary to get a useable guest)

I found traces of its existence as far as:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1743441
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-02/msg02337.html

And i found the issue brieffly commented at https://www.os2world.com/forum/index.php?topic=2346.0
I quote: 
 
'Regarding QEMU/KVM, OS/2 runs in QEMU mostly fine. Except the trap in os2lvm.dmd and non-working netbeui.os2 and
tcpbeui.os2. The problem with os2lvm.dmd is because QEMU closely follows the intel spec, which is incorrect. The spec says
that 16-bit SGDT instruction behaves the same like in i286 processor. But it's not true, it behaves like i386 instruction. So, QEMU
emulates SGDT 16-bit instruction incorrectly. OS2LVM.DMD uses 16-bit SGDT instruction and it hits the problem.'

After a brief discussion on the Warp4 group at groups.io where I was told that this is indeed a Qemu bug, I thought someone has 
to report on that.
