LDC, STC unimplemented in qemu-system-arm
Description of problem:
I used differential testing to compared the instruction consistency (ARMv7) between QEMU and raspberry pi 2B in system level and some inconsistency in LDC, SDC instruction was detected.

The instructions run successfully in raspi2b, but cause undefined in QEMU. I found that LDC and SDC instructions remain unimplemented in QEMU.
