Windows 98 First Edition emulation problems

System: Debian SID x86 with latest updates

1) QEMU compiled from latest main GIT branch (and 1.7 stable version)
./configure options: ./configure --enable-sdl --target-list=i386-softmmu --cpu=i686 --audio-drv-list=alsa

When you try to boot Windows 98 First Edition (Italian), it does not simply boot. It stays on booting screen. 
If you try to install, the installation goes flawless, but when it boots it freeze.

I am launching VM with this: qemu-system-i386 -hda main.img -cpu pentium -m 256 -fda floppy1.img -boot c -soundhw gus -vga cirrus

I have tried with -M option "pc-i440fx-1.6" since 1.6 have no problems with the booting of Win98, but nothing. No fix found.

2) QEMU 1.6.2 (same compile and launching options)
gus soundboard seems not recognized even with real dos drivers (tried to install theme into real dos mode).
with SoundBlaster 16 i have following error: WARNING: I/O thread spun for 1000 iterations, making the emulation impossible (too slow, and sound is stuttering) . Tried to compile with oss and sdl option on audio-drv-list but no fix found.

Any ideas? thank you

Even with Windows 98 SE (English and Italian) still not working. Got some ideas?

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
