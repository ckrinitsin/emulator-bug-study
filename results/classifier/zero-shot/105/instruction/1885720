qemu/migration/postcopy-ram.c:387: bad return expression ?

qemu/migration/postcopy-ram.c:387:9: style: Non-boolean value returned from function returning bool [returnNonBoolInBooleanFunction]

Source code is

       return -1;

but

bool postcopy_ram_supported_by_host(

That looks like a bug, indeed!

Yes, I think a goto out; there makes sense;  nearly 5 years old that error :-)
