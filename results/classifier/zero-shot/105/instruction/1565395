qemu-2.4.1 fails when compiled against pulseaudio

If I compile qemu-2.4.1 like this:

CC="gcc -mtune=generic -Os -pipe" CXX="g++ -mtune=generic -Os -pipe
-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
--localstatedir=/var --libexecdir=/usr/local/lib/qemu
--interp-prefix=/usr/local/share/qemu --disable-smartcard-nss
--disable-curses --disable-brlapi --audio-drv-list="oss alsa sdl"
--target-list="i386-softmmu i386-linux-user x86_64-softmmu
x86_64-linux-user" --smbd=/usr/local/sbin/smbd

find . -name config-host.mak -type f -exec sed -i 's/-O2//g' {} \;

make

..it works fine.

If I add pulseaudio dev files and use --audio-drv-list="oss alsa sdl pa",
then "qemu-system-x86_64 -blah-blah" opens a window, displays the bios
message and stops. Strace shows qemu is not hung, but loops continually.

The same happens with qemu-2.2.1 and qemu-2.5.0.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
