system_powerdown/system_reset not working when exec stop on hmp

system_powerdown/system_reset stops working in qemu for centos kernels if KVM is enabled.

qemu versioin: 2.4
linux kernel versioin: 4.2.5

How to reproduce:

1. qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -drive if=none,id=drive0,file=/media/sda5/image/fc21/fc21.raw -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=drive0,iothread=iothread0 -machine smm=off -object iothread,id=iothread0 -monitor stdio
2. Enter stop in the qemu console, we can see the vm is stopped.
3. Enter system_powerdown in the qemu console
4. Nothing happens.

Can you please give a prompt or something else when the vm isn't allowed to powerdown or reset?

Looking through old bug tickets ... I don't think this was really a bug. If you stop your guest, of course the guest operating system can not powerdown anymore. It should powerdown once you resume your guest with "cont".
