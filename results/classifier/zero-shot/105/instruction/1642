Qemu aarch64 tcg crashes when emulating an STXP instruction but only on a Windows host
Description of problem:
Qemu segfaults when trying to emulate an STXP instruction, but only when running natively on a windows host (msys2 build). This is not the same as https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1581.

I've managed to git-bisect it to this change: https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/546789c7df8866c55cae8d3195e8e58328a35d51
Sadly i cannot investigate it further and contribute a fix, but it seems like a problem with one of the I128 arguments to `helper_atomic_cmpxchgo_le `

UPD: Issue is also in master (as of `caa9cbd566877b34e9abcc04d936116fc5e0ab28`)
Steps to reproduce:
N/A
