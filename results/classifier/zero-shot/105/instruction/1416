Description of problem:
After upgrading to QEMU v7.2.0 from v7.1.0, when executing stg/ldg instructions on any address, QEMU behaves as if the instruction was executed on the page base of said address.

I believe this was introduced in b8967ddf393aaf35fdbc07b4cb538a40f8b6fe37 (@rth7680), since in that commit `ptr_paddr` is changed to be calculated based on `CPUTLBEntryFull::phys_addr`, which contains the page base address, while beforehand it was calculated based on `host` which does have the page offset applied.
