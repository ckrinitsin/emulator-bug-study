target-ppc/int_helper.c: 2 * bad array index

1.

[qemu/target-ppc/int_helper.c:2575]: (error) Array 'reg.u16[8]' accessed at index 8, which is out of bounds.

Source code is

   return reg->u16[8 - n];

and

qemu/target-ppc/cpu.h:    uint16_t u16[8];

but at least once, n is zero, for example line 2725 in the int_helper.c file:

    uint16_t sgnb = get_national_digit(b, 0);

2.

[qemu/target-ppc/int_helper.c:2584]: (error) Array 'reg.u16[8]' accessed at index 8, which is out of bounds.
