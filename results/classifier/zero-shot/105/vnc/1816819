Chardev websocket stops listening after first connection disconnects

Using qemu option:
 -chardev socket,id=websock0,websocket,port=13042,host=127.0.0.1,server,nowait -serial chardev:websock0

To have a websocket listening chardev. After the first connection disconnects (that does a full websocket handshake), subsequent connections aren't accepted. See below for a reproducing session kindly provided by Daniel:

$ telnet localhost 13042

telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused

I can confirm that this patch fixes the issue. I can now reconnect after a client has disconnected.
