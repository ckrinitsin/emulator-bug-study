Unnecessary events option of the trace argument with UST backend

When running configure with the --enable-trace-backends=ust option the user should not have to specify a the "events" and "file" options because they are not used with that tracing framework.

Right now, in order the use this option the need to specify a dummy events file.

This fails:
$> qemu-system-x86_64 -hda debian_wheezy_amd64_standard.qcow2 -trace -m 512               
qemu-system-x86_64: -trace -m: Invalid parameter '-m'

This works:
$> qemu-system-x86_64 -hda debian_wheezy_amd64_standard.qcow2 -trace events=dummy-events.txt -m 512
VNC server running on `127.0.0.1:5900'

I am using version:
$> qemu-system-x86_64 --version

What happens when you pass no -trace option?

Stefan


It works without the -trace option.

Want I meant with this post is that the "events" argument of the "-trace" option has no effect in the case of using LTTng UST as the tracing backend because the events are enabled from the LTTng tracer itself.
 
Is there some way I can make an argument optional or conditional to a tracing framework?

Thanks,

Francis

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
