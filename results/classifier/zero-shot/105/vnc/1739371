qemu-system-arm snapshot loadvm core dumped

Ubuntu Qemu is crashing trying to restore saved snapshot in qemu-system-arm.
I've tried different guests kernels, but I wasn't lucky with any of them.

The guest vm boots and I can use it normally. The issue is when I save the snapshot using "savevm Base0", "quit" and then I restore that snapshot using "-loadvm Base0" from the cmd line.

The only difference I've noticed is tweaking the guest memory:
* With -m 512 or 1024 it crashes as you can see below.
* With -m 2048 it doesn't crash, it restores the vm and I can see the screen as it was, but the OS is halted. And it's not just the keyboard. I've tried saving the snapshot while it's booting with lot of lines being printed on screen and after restoring it, the OS is frozen.

I also tried limiting the guest kernel memory using the mem parameter (mem=2048M) and disabling the kernel address space randomization (nokaslr) with the same results.

OS: Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (xenial)

As I said above, the same happens when -m 1024 is used.

I have a different issue when I use the qemu git master version, but I'm submiting a different ticket for that.

Cheers,
Gus

I suspect this is the same underlying state save/restore bug as your other LP:1739378 -- it's just that since 2.5.0 we've improved the error reporting for cases where the incoming migration state doesn't match what we're expecting, so we report an error message rather than just mangling the simulation state and causing the guest to crash on restart.


Thanks Peter for your prompt response.

I wonder if you have any plan of fixing it. Also if there is any workaround.

Is the bug limited to arm? Is there any main ticket where I can follow the
progress of this issue?

I'm going to close this bug as a duplicate of #1739378 (as noted in my earlier comment).
