vnc websocket option not properly parsed when running on commandline

All of my vms are started with a simple script on the command line.  
Starting with Qemu 2.3.0, the option "-vnc host:port,websocket" is no longer working.

Previously if I said listen on Tor:17,websocket it would function correctly.  Now it's kicking an error:


qemu-system-x86_64: -vnc tor:17,websocket: Failed to start VNC server on `(null)': address resolution failed for tor:on: Servname not supported for ai_socktype

The error leads me to believe it's not parsing the command line options for the "vnc" option correctly.  If I leave off ",websocket" it works correctly.  I've even tried, replacing the hostname with an IP address, and using the alternate form " -display vnc=tor:17,webscoket". It reports the same error.

Someone has had a similar issue with the port portion of the display as a string and not an integer (so it's looking in /etc/services etc):

I have more information about the bug.  The host I'm running this on is called "tor' (no, it has nothing to do with an onion router, its an old nickname and something I've been calling my main dev host for years). Its IP is 10.16.0.5.  If I designate the command line option  as "-vnc tor:11,websocket=5711" or "-vnc 10.16.0.5:11,websocket=5711" it appears to work fine.

I have to include the specific IP I wish it to listen on because this host has a lot of different interfaces, and I don't want it listening on all interfaces.  So there's still an issue with it resolving the "short" name in local dns to the local IP, and listening only on that IP with the abbreviated option.  It's still not parsed correctly.

On another host, with much fewer interfaces and addresses, a simple "-vnc :80,websocket" works fine without modification.   Same version of Qemu, the ArchLinux x86_64 package for 2.3.0-2.



This is an accidental regression caused by

Dan's patch linked in comment #4 went into git as commit 1b1aeb5828c978a, so this has been fixed (with the fix going into the 2.9.0 release).
