qemu-system-riscv64 failed to load binary kernel into memory

QEMU Version: 5.1.0
Compiled in Ubuntu 20.04 for riscv64, following the guide https://risc-v-getting-started-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/linux-qemu.html.

In qemu-system-riscv64, code at 0x80000000 will be executed by virtual CPU.
For example, using `qemu-system-riscv64 -nographic -machine virt -bios none -kernel vmlinux -S -s`, my homebrew kernel(ELF file) will load at 0x80000000. If I strip the kernel using `riscv64-linux-gnu-objcopy -O binary vmlinux Image`, qemu-system-riscv64 will not load the binary machine code into the riscv64 load address, but `-bios Image` will.

In `qemu-system-aarch64` compiled by Ubuntu team, I can use `qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3 -kernel Image_aarch64 -S -s` to load a specific machine code binary into 0x80000. And the elf kernel can be loaded to that address, too.

This is not a bug. As you said, please use `-bios Image` for your
special purpose.

As per Bin Meng, closing as not-a-bug.

Just an update on this.

You can use -bios to load your image, which will load it to address 0x80000000.

In QEMU 5.1 `-bios none -kernel Image` will load the Image to 0x80020000/0x80040000 depending on XLEN.

QEMU 5.2 will now correctly load the above mentioned Image to address 0x80000000 if you don't load a firmware (`-bios none`).
