RDP traffic freeze on quiet network

Hi,

I recently started using KVM over VirtualBox for my Office needs. I setup a Windows 7 VM on KVM and started using it through remote desktop. 

What happens is that, after some hours of usage, the remote desktop connection freezes. I thought it was a remmina bug, as the it was enough to kill and restart it to successfully connect again to the VM.

However, today I've switched to a different RDP client (2X Client chromium app) and the freeze just happened again!

Some information:
- the host and the VM are completely idle when the freeze occurs
- I've tried sniffing the network packets toward the RDP port during the freeze and found that the client is sending packets but no packet is sent back


Could this be a KVM issue? How can I further debug this one (I expect the freeze to happen again...)?

Thanks for reporting this bug.  Could you please give us more
information on the VM host and the client?  What do you mean
by 'kvm over virtualbox'?  How exactly did you set it up?
Is the remote desktop running on a windows machine?

My guess is that the answer lies in 'kvm on virtualbox', and
how that is exporting a display to the client.

Marking this incomplete, please feel free to re-mark it new
after replying.  Marking low priority as, IF I understand right,
the VM continues to run, making this annoying but with no risk of
data loss.

 status: incomplete
 importance: low


Hi Serge,

Thanks for the reply.


What I meant is that I started using KVM for my virtualization needs, while I was previously using VirtualBox. Sorry for not being clear on this point.


Yes the VM continues to run, however it is pretty annoying and can potentially imply that for me Win 7 on KVM is not usable in practice (think about hangs during customer presentations... ).


Thanks.




Could you show the exact remmina command you were using to connect to the VM?

If you do 'gvncviewer localhost:0' (from the same machine on which kvm is running), what do you see?

Hi Serge,

I'm invoking remmina from the Unity shell, not from the terminal.

As regard your question: I'm connecting to the VM via RDP, not VNC (it is
much faster).

Could you please tell me, perhaps with some screenshots, exactly what
boxes you fill in how to start the connection?

IIUC RDP connects to the guest itself over the guest's network.  vnc wlil
connect to the kvm process.  So if the problem has to do with the
guest's networking hanging, then connecting over vnc might let you
analyze the guest state despite guest network being down.

When the RDP connection hangs, can you simply start a new one
immediately?


Hi Serge,

Please find attached the remmina configuration screenshots.

Yes, when the RDP connection hangs I simply close the RDP client and start
a new one immediately and it works correctly.

As I mentioned, please consider that this happens also with a completely
different RDP client, so it probably has nothing to do with remmina itself.

Thank you!

It just happened again.

This time I have recorded some new information.

netstat shows a costant, non zero Send-Q:

Sniffing that connection with tcpdump, I can see that no packets flows back
from the VM (port 3389) back to the client:

Looks like a network issue?

Confirmed in raring.

Actually no, in my case after I had started up IE and left it sitting, the desktop logged me out, which made windows change its network settings so that RDP was not allowed.  I had to log back in over spicy before I could reconnect over RDP.

In fact that did not suffice (this is raring, not precise) - windows needed to reboot to reset the model=rtl8139 nic (over tap device).

Could you tell me which network device type you are using?

It looks like I should set up a precise host on which to test.

Hi Serge,

Thanks for that.

Please find attached my VM complete xml configuration file (virsh dumpxml).

Hi,

(You probably knkow this, but to explain my request, the RDP connection goes over the VM's virtual network card to talk directly to the VM.  Provided you have only a single VM running, 'gvncviewer localhost:0' (or the equivalent with ssh port forwarding if you can't run X on the host) talks to the kvm process.)

Could you please start the VM, run RDP until it hangs, then connect with vnc and use the windows network admin commands to see what windows thinks is going on?  I.e. does it think it is still connected to a network?  If not, can you simply reconnect, or do you have to restart the driver, or do you have to restart the VM altogether?

I'm pretty sure htis is a bug in the qemu nic emulation, but am not sure where to begin diagnosing.

Hi Serge,

I performed the experiment you suggested:

1) Connected with RDP client
2) Worked until it hanged
3) Successfully connected to the VM via virt-manager (RDP client still
freezed)
4) Verified that Windows is still connected to the network
5) Successfully pinged my host IP from within the VM (ping 192.168.122.1)


So it doesn't seem to be a network disconnect issue.


Can you think of anything else?



Thanks!

Thanks!  So just to be sure, after this did you check whether the RDP
client worked again?  If not, were you able to re-connect with a new
RDP client?  If so, then can you also re-connect with a new RDP client
without first connecting via VNC and pinging the host from the guest?
(This should tell us whether the problem is the RDP server in windows,
or the network connection at some layer going stale until we ping).


Hi Serge,

In order to reconnect, I have simply restarted another RDP client without
any further step required (no need to use VNC and ping, it was just a test
to check network connectivity).

Hi,

I reported the #1212051 (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu-kvm/+bug/1212051) bug with Windows XP, but reading this case i think it could be the same issue. 

I connect via RDP to my windows XP VM and after a while it seems to freeze, then, I connect via VNC an without doing anything the communications are restored between the VM and the outside world. So i can connect again with RDP.

Even more, if i leave an open connection with VNC (minimized because is more slow than RDP), connecting via RDP has no trouble and no problem of freeze (lost of communications) occurs.

f3a97, Could you do this test and tell if you have the same experience than i?,  If so, my bug is the same of this.
Thanks.


Hi Hector,


My network configuration is different than yours - it is not bridged.
Perhaps this might help to diagnose the issue?


I'm now trying to sniff network traffic generated by the VM and see what
happens during RDP hangs: does it still poll outside servers (i.e. google
drive) or will become disconnected?


I'll report the results, stay tuned.

Hi,

Eventually I've been able to reproduce the hang.

Just to recap the experiment: I have recorded network traffic during RDP
connection hangs. The result is that the VM has do not experience total
network loss: network traffic continues to flow (tcpdump from the host on
ports other than 3389).

I also see these EXACT symptoms, using kvm (VM managed through livirt virsh) on Debian x64 host, guest is Windows 8, RedHat VirtIo network driver.

rgds

Hi f3a97,  did you tried to connect via VNC when the freeze situation occurs?

This method works as a a workaround to defreeze my windows VM. 

Since a couple of weeks ago, we started to reboot the VM diary.  With this way, the problem occurs very less. We have counted only twice in this period.

I added a rtl8139c netcard to the VM and connected through it by RDP - no more freezes.

It looks like kvm does not play well with virtio network cards and RDP.

Red Hat virtio net windows driver version: 62.65.104.6500, 6/19/2013

I left the RH adapter on the VM, I just connect via RDP through the rtl8139c network card.





Thanks for the tip Dumitrescu,

I'll rive it a try AMD report here che result.

This makes me wonder if the bug may not actually be in the virtio net driver.
The source for that is at
https://github.com/YanVugenfirer/kvm-guest-drivers-windows .
Something like commit 9b1b81a731f722efa8df24429649b527a17bf433 might
be relevant (assuming the git HEAD has this fixed, which I've not
tested).


Hi,

I've double checked my conf, I can confirm I'm not using virtio but
standard Win 7 drivers. (please see my VM conf that I posted some time ago).

So it's not definitely a virtio-specific issue.

[Expired for qemu-kvm (Ubuntu) because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
