Quaint English in qemu-options.hx
Description of problem:
qemu-options.hx contains grammar that a native English-speaking person would never use. I had to read a sentence in that file very slowly and more than once to understand it.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install QEMU
2. Run a command to display documentation that includes qemu-options.hx for instance "man qemu-system-x86_64"
3. Observe "This option defines where is connected the drive ..."
4. Scratch head, figure out that "This option defines where the drive is connected ..." is the meaning.
Additional information:
It is very difficult to report QEMU documentation bugs.
