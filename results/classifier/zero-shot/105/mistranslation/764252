wishlist: kirkwood support

This is a feature request for qemu to emulate the Marvell Kirkwood chipset. It is used by Sheevaplug, Guruplug, and many NAS devices.

This was added in 2011, is there a plan to integrate support for kirkwood?

With "this" I mean the bugreport, not the feature requested.

If somebody wants to write and submit code I will review it. I am not aware of anybody who is working on kirkwood emulation support or with plans to do so.


Apparently nobody submitted code for this, and I assume nobody is interested in this kirkwood platform nowadays any more, so I'm closing this ticket now.

For the record, I still regularly use a Kirkwood device (a QNAP NAS).  Being able to compile software for it in qemu would be handy once in a while, though it's not a high priority for me.

My offer from comment #3 to review code if anybody wants to submit it still stands, but given the amount of work required to implement a model of a new SoC in QEMU I'm not surprised nobody's ever taken me up on it.
