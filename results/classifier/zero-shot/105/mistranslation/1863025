Use-after-free after flush in TCG accelerator

I believe I found a UAF in TCG that can lead to a guest VM escape. The security 
list informed me "This can not be treated as a security issue." and to post it 
here. I am looking at the 4.2.0 source code. The issue requires a race and I 
will try to describe it in terms of three concurrent threads.

I am looking 
at the 4.2.0 source code. The issue requires a race and I will try to describe 
it in terms of three concurrent threads.

Thread A:

A1. qemu_tcg_cpu_thread_fn runs work loop
A2. qemu_wait_io_event => qemu_wait_io_event_common => process_queued_cpu_work
A3. start_exclusive critical section entered
A4. do_tb_flush is called, TB memory freed/re-allocated
A5. end_exclusive exits critical section

Thread B:

B1. qemu_tcg_cpu_thread_fn runs work loop
B2. tcg_cpu_exec => cpu_exec => tb_find => tb_gen_code
B3. tcg_tb_alloc obtains a new TB

Thread C:

C1. qemu_tcg_cpu_thread_fn runs work loop
C2. cpu_exec_step_atomic executes
C3. TB obtained with tb_lookup__cpu_state or tb_gen_code
C4. start_exclusive critical section entered
C5. cpu_tb_exec executes the TB code
C6. end_exclusive exits critical section

Consider the following sequence of events:
  B2 => B3 => C3 (same TB as B2) => A3 => A4 (TB freed) => A5 => B2 => 
  B3 (re-allocates TB from B2) => C4 => C5 (freed/reused TB now executing) => C6

In short, because thread C uses the TB in the critical section, there is no 
guarantee that the pointer has not been "freed" (rather the memory is marked as 
re-usable) and therefore a use-after-free occurs.

Since the TCG generated code can be in the same memory as the TB data structure,
it is possible for an attacker to overwrite the UAF pointer with code generated
from TCG. This can overwrite key pointer values and could lead to code 
execution on the host outside of the TCG sandbox.

The bug describes a race whereby cpu_exec_step_atomic can acquire a TB
which is invalidated by a tb_flush before we execute it. This doesn't
affect the other cpu_exec modes as a tb_flush by it's nature can only
occur on a quiescent system. The race was described as:

  B2. tcg_cpu_exec => cpu_exec => tb_find => tb_gen_code
  B3. tcg_tb_alloc obtains a new TB

      C3. TB obtained with tb_lookup__cpu_state or tb_gen_code
          (same TB as B2)

          A3. start_exclusive critical section entered
          A4. do_tb_flush is called, TB memory freed/re-allocated
          A5. end_exclusive exits critical section

  B2. tcg_cpu_exec => cpu_exec => tb_find => tb_gen_code
  B3. tcg_tb_alloc reallocates TB from B2

      C4. start_exclusive critical section entered
      C5. cpu_tb_exec executes the TB code that was free in A4

The simplest fix is to widen the exclusive period to include the TB
lookup. As a result we can drop the complication of checking we are in
the exclusive region before we end it.

I've attached a variant of the suggested patch which simply expands the exclusive period. It's hard to test extensively as not many things use the EXCP_ATOMIC mechanism. Can I ask how you found the bug and if you can re-test with the suggested patch?

I found it just by launching Ubuntu 19.10 live cd with QXL driver. I will re-test this weekend.

The workaround I had is to check the number of TLB flushes and to re-try obtaining the TB if the number changes. There is a penalty for the case where TLB is flushed but should not degrade performance in most cases. I think obtaining the lock earlier will slow down the VM if EXCP_ATOMIC is used often.

Of course, I am assuming TLB flush is the only way to cause this bug.

What race are you thinking of in my patch? The obvious race I can
think of is benign:

Case 1:
A: does TB flush
B: read tb_flush_count
A: increment tb_flush_count
A: end_exclusive
B: tb_lookup__cpu_state/tb_gen_code
B: start_exclusive
B: read tb_flush_count again (increment seen)
B: retries

Case 2:
B: read tb_flush_count
A: does TB flush
A: increment tb_flush_count
A: end_exclusive
B: tb_lookup__cpu_state/tb_gen_code
B: start_exclusive
B: read tb_flush_count again (increment seen)
B: retries

Case 3:
A: does TB flush
A: increment tb_flush_count
A: end_exclusive
B: read tb_flush_count
B: tb_lookup__cpu_state/tb_gen_code
B: start_exclusive
B: read tb_flush_count again (no increment seen)
B: proceeds

Case 1 is the expected case. Case 2, we thought TB was stale but it
wasn't so we get it again with tb_lookup__cpu_state with minimal extra
overhead.

Case 3 seems to be bad because we could read tb_flush_count and find
it already incremented. But if so that means thread A is at the end of
do_tb_flush and the lookup tables are already cleared and the TCG
context is already reset. So it should be safe for thread B to call
tb_lookup__cpu_state or tb_gen_code.

Fixed here:
https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=886cc68943eb

CVE-2020-24165 was assigned to this:
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24165

I had no involvement in the assignment, posting here for reference only.

In any case per our stated security policy, we do not consider TCG to
be providing a security boundary between host and guest, and thus bugs
in TCG aren't considered security flaws:

Right, and it is clearly indicated in the referenced launchpad bug:
'The security list informed me "This can not be treated as a security
issue"'.

This adds up to CVE-2022-36648, which is also a mystery to me in terms
of CVE assignment and CVSS scoring (rated as Critical). I don't know
what's going on with NVD, there must be something wrong on their side.

I disputed both CVEs via https://cveform.mitre.org/.
