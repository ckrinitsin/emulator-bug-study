QEMU not able to boot ubuntu 18.04 as a guest

Host information:
sushant@sushant-OptiPlex-7050:~$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
Release:	18.04
Codename:	bionic


QEMU version:
sushant@sushant-OptiPlex-7050:~$ /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64   --version
QEMU emulator version 2.11.1(Debian 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.12)

I am trying to install xubuntu 18.04 as a qemu guest. The installation process goes smoothly and I reboot. After reboot, the boot process hangs with black screen and a blinking pointer. I used the following steps to install and boot the machine:
sudo qemu-img create /var/lib/libvirt/images/xubuntu18_04.qcow2 30G

sudo qemu-system-x86_64-spice -enable-kvm -cpu host -boot d -cdrom /home/sushant/Downloads/xubuntu-18.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso /var/lib/libvirt/images/xubuntu18_04.qcow2   -m 8G

sudo qemu-system-x86_64-spice -enable-kvm -cpu host  /var/lib/libvirt/images/xubuntu18_04.qcow2   -m 8G






I tried with ubuntu 18.04(deafult ubuntu) and it also hangs with error "removed slice user slice of gdm"


Also, if I install ubuntu 16.04 as guest, it boots smoothly.

What should be done?

Switched bug to the ubuntu qemu package, since qemu-system-x86_64-spice is not an upstream provided binary

$ ll /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64-spice
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 18 MÃ¤r 25 13:32 /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64-spice -> qemu-system-x86_64*

This is just a compat symlink for a very old history.
It should not be used directly anymore, but then also not matter.

I have not seen the same with Ubuntu Desktops, so I wonder what is different in your setup.

@Sushant - have you tried the same with e.g. libvirt (maybe through virt-manager), does it behave the same on that backend?
Furthermore this might be when the UI kicks in, could you set up (on install) an ssh client and login to log in when it is black and check what is going on at the time?

maybe this is just this issue? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1795857

I am able to start the VM using 'virt-manager' but not using 'qemu-system-x86_64-spice'. I am using the command line so that I want pass 2 additional options viz.
1. -machine epc
2. -machine epc-below-4g
both for SGX virtualization.

I dont know how to ssh to the VM since I dont know the IP address of the guest machine.

I want to use 'qemu-system-x86_64-spice' so that I can use both the additional options.

Quite likely @flumm
-vga cirrus => works
-vga qxl => works
-vga std (the default) stays black.

For now  @sushant add "-vga qxl" to your commandline please.

Also adding
 -net user,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22 -net nic
And install+configuring openssh-server in the guest allows to take a look at the faild system

In fact it shows issues with the GPU as expected.
This is not a qemu but a kernel bug and I'll dup it.
