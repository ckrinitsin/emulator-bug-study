RFE: Implement support for SMBIOS Type 41 structures

This was originally filed in Fedora bugzilla: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=669955  

"""
Please extend the existing support for SMBIOS in qemu to add a capability to provide "Onboard Devices Extended Information" (Type 41). Not only is this replacing one of the existing types, but it also provides a mapping between devices and physical system chassis locations. But there is no physical chassis! Right. However, this doesn't mean you don't want to tell the guest OS which virtual (e.g. network) interface is which. You can do that, if you implement this extension that is already going into real hardware, and likely other VMs too.

See also page 117 of the v2.7 of the SMBIOS spec.

FWIW, VMware ESX and Workstation expose their PCI NICs in the PCI IRQ Routing Table.  Kind of odd the first time you see it with biosdevname, as your NIC becomes pci3#1, but that's "correct" from a BIOS perspective. :-)

Hello, I'm intersted in this bug fix and have some free time. maybe I can do this bug-fix.

I have sent a first patch around this: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-03/msg09391.html


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
