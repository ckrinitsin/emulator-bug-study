-icount sleep=on|off documentation is confusing

The documentation for the -icount option in the qemu man page says:

"When the virtual cpu is sleeping, the virtual time will advance at default speed unless sleep=on|off is specified. With sleep=on|off, the virtual time will jump to the next timer deadline instantly whenever the virtual cpu goes to sleep mode and will not advance if no timer is enabled."

Taking this literally and specifying "sleep=on|off" on the command line does not work, so presumably the two instances of "sleep=on|off" should be either "sleep=on" or "sleep=off",
whichever is correct :)

Also, the synopsis line "-icount [shift=N|auto][,rr=record|replay,rrfile=filename,rrsnapshot=snapshot" fails to mention the sleep keyword at all.

Should be fixed by this patch:
