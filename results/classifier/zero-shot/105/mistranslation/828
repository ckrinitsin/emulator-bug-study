using qemu-system-x86_64 to start multiple windows 10 guests concurrently , the mac address of the guests is incorrect
Description of problem:
I plan to run multiple windows 10 guests concurrently, I choose NAT network and specify a unique MAC addr for each guest. and I choose dnsmasq as a dhcp server. but I found that all guests MAC addresses are the same as the guest started first. 
This situation also occurs in windows 8. But the strange thing is that this never happened to windows7 guests.
I'm Chinese and my English is pool, please forgive my bad expressions.
Steps to reproduce:
1.make a windows 10 image
2.qemu-system-x86_64 command  assign unique MAC addr
3. python multiprocess lib running command above
