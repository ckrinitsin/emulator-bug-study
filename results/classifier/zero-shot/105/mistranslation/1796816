Wrong keyboard in QEMU Windows for OpenSUSE PowerPC

I am trying to run an OpenSUSE PowerPC Little Endian system under Microsoft Windows. I have an English UK keyboard. The keyboard is basically correct (I get a 'pound' sign when I press shift-3) but some of the keys are rendered incorrectly. The wrong keys are
\ renders as # (just right of left hand shift key)
| renders as ~ (shift-\)
' renders as ` (2 keys right of l)
@ renders as Â¬ (shift-')
# renders as ' (3 keys right of l)
~ renders as @ (shift-#)

QEMU command line was
>"\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-ppc64.exe" -hda opensuse.qcow2

OpenSUSE was installed from download.opensuse.org/ports/ppc/tumbleweed/iso/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-DVD-ppc64le-Current.iso .

I am running OpenSUSE in runlevel 3 (no X11).

I don't really know whether the problem is with QEMU, the Windows port of QEMU, or with OpenSUSE Tumbleweed.

This is with QEMU for Windows 3.0.0 from https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/

I have configured a matching PowerPC virtual machine under an OpenSUSE Tumbleweed x86_64 host with qemu-ppc64 for that platform, and the keyboard mapping is correct for all keys. So the bug I have come across is presumably a bug with the WIndows port of QEMU.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
