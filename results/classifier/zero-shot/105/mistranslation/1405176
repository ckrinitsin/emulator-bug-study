I download 2.2.0 release  on http://wiki.qemu.org/Download
the monitor console does not appear in gtk display but works for sdl and vnc.
my gtk is 3.12.2

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
