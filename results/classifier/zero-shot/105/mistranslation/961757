wrong error for blockdev-snapshot-sync

From Laszlo Ersek:

>> +    proto_drv = bdrv_find_protocol(snapshot_file);
>>      if (!proto_drv) {
>> -        qerror_report(QERR_INVALID_BLOCK_FORMAT, format);
>> -        ret = -1;
>> -        goto out;
>> +        error_set(errp, QERR_INVALID_BLOCK_FORMAT, format);
>> +        return;
>>      }
>

Which version of QEMU was this? Is this still a problem with the latest version of QEMU?

I can't find anything in the blockdev-snapshot-sync path that has this code in it still. Think it's a non-issue in 2017.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
