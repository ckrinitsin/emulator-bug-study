launchpad homepage url is out of date

The launchpad "homepage" link to QEMU's homepage is http://www.nongnu.org/qemu/, this link immediately redirects one to http://qemu.org (then wiki.qemu.org).

The link should probably be updated to http://qemu.org

As far as I can see, the "home page" link is now set to http://wiki.qemu-project.org/ - so it seems this has been fixed.
