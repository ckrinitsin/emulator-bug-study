CGA Mode 6 is only 100 pixels tall, when it's supposed to be 200

I have written a program that used CGA Mode 6 (640x200 black and white). However qemu-system-i386 only displays the first 100 pixels, effectively limiting the resolution of mode 6 to 640x100. When running the same program on a real computer it uses the whole 640x200 pixels.

Could you please provide a test program for this issue?
