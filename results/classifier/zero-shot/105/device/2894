There is a bug in versions 2025-02-10 and later that causes virtual machines to be created with incorrect SMP settings with warnings about TCG features when setting more than 2 cores with the smp option in the default TCG acceleration (see main text).
Description of problem:
When using qemu-system-x86_64 in versions 9.2.50 and later, if you create a virtual machine with 2 or more cores using the smp option,

```
qemu-system-x86_64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.01H:EDX.ht [bit 28]
qemu-system-x86_64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.cmp-legacy [bit 1]
```
The log will be displayed as many as the number of cores you have enabled, and the created virtual machine will be displayed as having a 1-core CPU with the number of cores you have enabled.
* I have not tested whether the same symptom occurs on versions 9.2.50 and later for other environments (Linux and the WoA version released on March 26th).
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a virtual machine with more than two cores using TCG acceleration, which is the default acceleration, by using options such as 'qemu-system-x86_64 -smp 2' or 'qemu-system-x86_64 -smp sockets=1,cores=2,threads=1'.
2. 'qemu-system-x86_64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.01H:EDX.ht [bit 28]' and
'qemu-system-x86_64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.cmp-legacy [bit 1]'
The log is generated as many as the number of cores set and the virtual machine is created.
3. When checking the CPU information of the booted virtual machine, it does not show that there is one CPU with the specified number of cores, but rather that there is a single core CPU with the specified number of cores.
