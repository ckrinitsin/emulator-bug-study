8.1.0rc0: Build failure when building static binaries, auto config incorrectly mark bzip2 as supported on my machine
Description of problem:
8.1.0rc0 fails to build when I build static binaries.

```
Jul 24 20:28:22 clang-13: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-pie' [-Wunused-command-line-argument]
Jul 24 20:28:22 ld.lld: error: attempted static link of dynamic object /usr/bin/../lib/libbz2.so
Jul 24 20:28:22 clang-13: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

It seems that `./configure` mistaken my dynamic library of bzip2 as able to compile under static compilation.
Steps to reproduce:
1. `./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --static` with bzip2 only dynamicly installed and static library not installed
2. see output

You can see
```
    snappy support                               : NO
    bzip2 support                                : YES
    lzfse support                                : NO
```

which is wrong. Additionally, the compilation fails because the system only have bzip2 dynamicly but not staticly.
