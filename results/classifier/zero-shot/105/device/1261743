Thanks for the bug report.  I have posted a fix:
http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/250845


I assume Stefan's fix had been included (likely https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=736ec1677f1ae7e64f2f ?), so I'm closing this ticket now. But if you still can reproduce this issue, please let us know.
