[sdl] Mouse grab breaks GNOME 3 screensaver unlock screen

When the GNOME 3 screensaver activates with the mouse cursor over the SDL window, the screensaver will not unlock unless the gnome-shell process is killed and restarted manually. This seems to be related to the fact that the key strokes are grabbed by SDL, but the screensaver will not allow the Ctrl and Alt keys to be passed to QEMU to exit the mouse grab.

Qemu-kvm 1.0.1, QEMU 1.0.1, kernel 3.2.15.

I think this is a GNOME bug.  The screensaver should not activate if an X client has a grab and it cannot be stolen.

Does this problem still happen with the latest version of QEMU and GNOME?

On current versions (QEMU 2.8, GNOME-Shell 3.22.3 on Wayland), the screensaver will activate. Cursor control is given to the lock screen, everything works properly. After the screen is unlocked, the cursor is given back to QEMU and is still in "mouse grab" mode.
