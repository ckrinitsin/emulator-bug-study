qemu should close sound device when no more needs.

I use alsa directly or via pulseaudio on qemu.
And I use xmms2 as well as qemu.

When I use alsa, one of xmms2 or qemu can play sound.
When I use pulseaudio with qemu and pulseaudio -k, and pulseaudio --start,
qemu can't play sound.

I think that:
- qemu should open sound device when needs.
- qemu should close sound device when no more needs.

One of xmms2 or qemu can play sound, but both of them rarely play sound
at the same time.
qemu occurs error on pulseaudio -k, but once close and open the device,
the error will be recovered, I hope.

This will not work if qemu is chrooted, because audio devices (/dev) aren't usually available there.

So at least a naive approach should not be used.  If nothing else, it should be an option.

But really, with pulseaudio backend, there should be no need to go this route and to add new code.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
