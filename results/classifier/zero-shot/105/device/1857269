Keyboard not fully working on Windows version

Hello,

I am working with windows qemu version:

qemu-w64-setup-20190815

I have installed a msdos virtual machine on qemu with sp keyboard layout (Spain at Europe). I have found that some keys do not work in the way they should. I believe that the problem is that es qemu spanish keyboard layout is the latin one, la in msdos sysytem.

I ask you to create the Spain layout.



Thanks in advance.

Hello,

I thought that the not fully working problem on my laptop was originated by the es keymap file, but it is not. I have edited that file and I receive the same error. I believe that windows version of qemu has a problem, at least, with laptops. A few months ago I get this error with an asus laptop and nowdays I am even worse with a hp. I can not test the windows version with a desktop computer.

I will download every new version and I shall comment if it works.

Thanks for your attention.



This bug is solved in last version of qemu for windows.

Great work.

Best regards.
