hw/remote/mpqemu-link.c:221: bad error checking ?

hw/remote/mpqemu-link.c:221:36: warning: logical ‘and’ of mutually exclusive tests is always false [-Wlogical-op]

Source code is

   if (msg->cmd >= MPQEMU_CMD_MAX && msg->cmd < 0) {
        return false;
    }

Maybe better code:

   if (msg->cmd >= MPQEMU_CMD_MAX || msg->cmd < 0) {
        return false;
    }

It might be useful to switch on gcc compiler flag -Wlogical-op
to see these warnings.

Thanks, I've reported it on the mailing list, and a patch has now been posted here:
