vmstate_load_state return error into virtio_load function

Qemu version 4.2.1

In the function of virtio_load, the vmstate_load_state will return error in the following case.

The virtio is legacy mode(disable-modern=on,disable-legacy=off), virtio_device is in reset state. 

In the the function of "vmstate_load_state", it will load all subsection. For the vmstate_virtio_extra_state subsection. 
It will execute:
vmstate_load_state   -->
          ret = field->info->get(f, curr_elem, size, field);    line 143  vmstate.c.
           -->virtio_pci_load_extra_state
                        -->  vmstate_load_state
                                 -->qemu_peek_byte
But if the f->buf_index is same with buf_size, qemu_peek_byte function will set "-EIO" error. 
the field->info->get will return 0, then it will get the error "ret = qemu_file_get_error(f);". then the vmstate_load_state will return error.

It output is "Failed to load virtio/extra_state:extra_state"

Can you also reproduce this with the latest version of QEMU? Anyway:
The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
