Unable to build QEMU with dbus display support on Windows
Description of problem:
When building QEMU on Windows with `./configure --enable-dbus-display --enable-modules`, the following error appears:

`ERROR: Modules are not available for Windows`
Steps to reproduce:
1. Attempt to build QEMU on Windows (MSYS2 MinGW) with dbus display support
Additional information:
Attempting to build with only `--enable-dbus-display` does not work either, as it requires `--enable-modules`, which does not work on Windows:
`../meson.build:1598:0: ERROR: Feature dbus_display cannot be enabled: -display dbus requires --enable-modules`
