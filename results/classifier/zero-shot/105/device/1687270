Can't write to 9p shared folder with qemu 2.9.0

When running a virtual machine with qemu 2.9.0 with this parameter for sharing a folder:

-virtfs local,id=fsdev1,path=$HOME/git,security_model=none,mount_tag=git

then the folder is shared to the VM but in some subfolders I can't delete files. The guest system then reports that the file, I want to delete, is "no file or folder".

I've downgraded to 2.8.0 now, which re-enables deleting my files.

Is this a known bug which will be fixed with a future version?

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Independent of the tracker transition, some feedback to your report: from what you described so far, the most common cause for the behaviour you described is a simple file permission issue on host side. Please check which user your qemu process is running with there, then ensure that the files you want to be able to access from guest by 9p has the appropriate file permissions for that user on host side.

If the problem still persists there, then please provide more details about your configuration, especially an output of some files and their permissions on host side.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
