qemu command = not use
I do not use -no-kvm-irqchip or -no-kvm-pit switch or -no-kvm switch.

Report
I use jp106 keybord on host OS( Fedora Core 13), it work fine.
but I could not keyin "_" key on GestOS( CentOS-5.5, Slackware-13.1).
I change keybord but same result, so I reported a bug.

A small patch to "qemu-0.15.0/ui/x_keymap.c" fixed this one:
           http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/38145/
nm

The following commit contains the patch that has been suggested in comment #1:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=33aa30cafcce053b83
... so this issue should be fixed in recent versions of QEMU.
