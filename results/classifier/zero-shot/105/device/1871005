Hi; I'm afraid that OSX 10.11 "El Capitan" isn't a supported build platform for QEMU. Our official support policy is that we support the two most recent versions (currently 10.14 Mojave and 10.15 Catalina); QEMU may also run on some earlier OSX versions we don't support, but we don't guarantee that or carry workarounds for missing functionality on those earlier versions. In this particular case, CLOCK_MONOTONIC was added to OSX 10.12 "Sierra".
