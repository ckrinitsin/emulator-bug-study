Unsupported ioctl: cmd=0xffffffff80685600 when accessing /dev/video* in aarch64 guest

**Description:**
Any attempt to work with video in aarch64 architecture emulated on x86_64 leads currently to the error "Function not implemented". For example:

```
# v4l2-ctl -l --verbose
Failed to open /dev/video0: Function not implemented

root@12dd9b6fcfcb:/# ll /dev/video*
crw-rw---- 1 root video 81, 0 Oct 16 09:23 /dev/video0
crw-rw---- 1 root video 81, 1 Oct 16 09:23 /dev/video1

```

**Steps to reproduce the issue:**

I have a following setup:

Host Hardware: x86_64 equipped with a webcam (tried different webcams)
Host OS: Ubuntu 20.04.1 

Guest Architecture: aarch64
Guest OS: Ubuntu 20.04 (also tried 16.x and 18.x)

Emulation: quemu-user-static (also tried binfmt)

Guest OS is running via Docker + QEMU

```
➜ cat /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/qemu-aarch64
enabled
interpreter /usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static
flags: F
offset 0
magic 7f454c460201010000000000000000000200b700

Guest aarch64 runs in privileged mode:

`docker run --privileged --device=/dev/video0:/dev/video0 --env DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY -v $XAUTH:/root/.Xauthority  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -it --rm arm64v8/ubuntu:20.04 bash`

**Additional information:**
I tried also binfmt way to register emulators. The output of `v4l-ctl` was a little bit different:

```
# v4l2-ctl -l    
Unsupported ioctl: cmd=0xffffffff80685600
Failed to open /dev/video0: Function not implemented

```

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
