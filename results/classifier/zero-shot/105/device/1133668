Bad validate ELF MIPSel format

To copy the information out of that web page for posterity:

the problem is that we weren't able to execute ELF files in linux-user if they had had the section table stripped out of them. We fixed this in the way suggested in that web page, by simply not checking the section header size, since we don't care about the section headers when we load ELF files. This was fixed in commit d3606f07440ee2c2bebea2 in 2011.
