SDL Doesn't Rescale Image on Resolution Change

Whilst in fullscreen mode, if the guest changes resolution for whatever reason, the screen doesn't update the scaling so you end up looking at only part of the screen, e.g. if the guest changes from 640x480 to 1024x768, the image will still be fullscreen, but what you're actually looking at will be the top-left most 640x480 segment of the screen stretched out.

Manually going out of fullscreen mode and then back in fixes the scaling, but you have to do that every time the guest changes resolution.

QEmu 2.12.0 using qemu-system-x86_64 with Arch Linux host.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
