Periodic mode of LAPIC doesn't fire interrupts when using kvm

It works fine when not using kvm and it does also work fine when using oneshot mode.

Tested with qemu 1.6.1 (commit 62ecc3a0e3c77a4944c92a02dd7fae2ab1f2290d).

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

I don't have the latest version yet, but I just tested it with 2.3.0 and it works.

Ok, thanks for testing. So if this has been fixed in QEMU 2.3, I assume that it is still fixed, thus let's close this ticket. If you hit the problem again with the latest version of QEMU, please re-open this bug or create a new one.
