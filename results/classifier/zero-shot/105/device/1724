qemu-system-riscv64 can't break by gdb
Description of problem:
The qemu-system-riscv64 can't break by gdb.  
( => The target is not responding to interrupt requests.  
Stop debugging it? (y or n) Quit)  

I using old qemu-system-risc64(7.2) don't has this issue.  

This test case running simple OS(riscv-xv6).
Steps to reproduce:
1.qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -bios none -kernel kernel/kernel -m 128M -smp 3 -nographic -global   virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false -drive file=fs.img,if=none,format=raw,id=x0 -device virtio-blk-  device,drive=x0,bus=virtio-mmio-bus.0 -S -gdb tcp::26000  
  
  
2.test@test-VirtualBox:~$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gdb -q                                                                                                                                                 
(gdb) target remote :26000

3.check xv6 is running.
