Plan 9 can't use GUI well emulating a RTL8139 card

The OS Plan 9 from Bell Labs runs fine in QEMU/KVM for the most part buy is unable to boot its GUI when emulating a RTL8139 WiFi card. I hear someone was able to get it working under a Windows XP host but I can't seem to do it under a Gentoo host. If you have any idea what may be doing this I would love to hear it.

Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
