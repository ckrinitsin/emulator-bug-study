netbeans not working with std graphic driver

Qemu Version:
QEMU emulator version 2.5.1, Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

Launching VM with:
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1024M ~/guest.vm -usb -vga std

Guest:
Kali Linux 2016.1
Kernel:
4.4.0-kali1-amd64
Affected Arch:
64bit & 32bit

Netbeans failing to start after netbeans splash comes up. No netbeans window is being drawn.
Problem can be reproduced.
It IS working with -vga qxl, so maybe there's a bug in std emulation.

output from netbeans log (more in attachement):

SEVERE [global]
java.lang.RuntimeException: failed to load system cursor: DnD.Cursor.CopyDrop : cannot load system cursor: CopyDrop.32x32



Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
