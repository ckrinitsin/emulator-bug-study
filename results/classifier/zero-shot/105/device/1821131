VM running under latest Qemu receives 2, 3, 8, and = when sent the keysyms for @, #, *, and + respectively

Git commit hash where bug was reproduced: 62a172e6a77d9072bb1a18f295ce0fcf4b90a4f2

A user of my application bVNC reported that when he connects to his VMs running under Qemu, he cannot send @, #, and *. Instead, 2, 3, and 8 appear in the VM respectively. I built the latest Qemu from source, and reproduced the issue.

bVNC converts keycodes or unicode characters that the Android keyboard sends it to corresponding keysyms. For example, it sends keysym 64 for @ rather than sending SHIFT+2.

A debug log of the application sending the keysyms shows metaState == 0, indicating lack of modifier keys. 

When 2 appears in place of @:

03-21 00:11:21.761  8864  8864 I RemoteKeyboard: Sending key. Down: true, key: 64. keysym:64, metaState: 0
03-21 00:11:21.763  8864  8864 I RemoteKeyboard: Sending key. Down: false, key: 64. keysym:64, metaState: 0

When 3 appears in place of #:

03-21 00:11:08.947  8864  8864 I RemoteKeyboard: Sending key. Down: true, key: 35. keysym:35, metaState: 0
03-21 00:11:08.950  8864  8864 I RemoteKeyboard: Sending key. Down: false, key: 35. keysym:35, metaState: 0

When 0 appears instead of *:

03-21 00:11:28.586  8864  8864 I RemoteKeyboard: Sending key. Down: true, key: 42. keysym:42, metaState: 0
03-21 00:11:28.588  8864  8864 I RemoteKeyboard: Sending key. Down: false, key: 42. keysym:42, metaState: 0

When = appears instead of +:
03-21 01:05:40.021 10061 10061 I RemoteKeyboard: Sending key. Down: true, key: 43. keysym:43, metaState: 0
03-21 01:05:40.022 10061 10061 I RemoteKeyboard: Sending key. Down: false, key: 43. keysym:43, metaState: 0

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
