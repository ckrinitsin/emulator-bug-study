Dos Keypad is not working for numbers - numlock is not working

Hello,
i tried to use Qemu 4.2 for Dos, but there is problem what in Dos is not possible turn on Numlock for input numbers, so games need it.. Numlock only working as arrow keys.
  I tested bough Windows and Linux builds.

I made the following experiments

openSuse 15.2
kde environment
qemu 4.2.1 and 5.2.0

VM: android-x86-7.1-r5 (www.android-x86.org)

1.

i add a standard 102 keys PC keyboard with "-device usb-kbd"

for host numlock is "on"
i launch the VM
for host numlock is on. We can use the numeric keypad.
for guest numlock is off! We can't use the numeric keypad.

Now to add the keyboard instead of "-device usb-kbd" I use "-device usb-host, vendorid=<hex number>,productid= <hex number>

for host numlock is "on"
I launch the VM
for host numlock is on. We can use the numeric keypad.
for guest numlock is on. We can use the numeric keypad.

2.

I add a standard 102 keys PC keyboard with "-device usb-kbd"

for the host the keyboard is in state "numlock on"
launch the VM
wait for launching is finished

for the host the keyboard is in state "numlock on". We see that the numlock ligh is on. We can use the numeric keypad.
but for the guest the keyboard is in state "numlock off" ! We can't use the numeric keypad.

type the key "numlock". the numlock light is switched off.

for the host the keyboard is in the state "numlock off". We can't use the numeric keypad to write 0...9, "."
for the guest the keyboard is in the state "numlock on" ! We can use the numeric keypad to write 0...9, "."

retype the key "numlock"

this time the numeric keypad is in state "numlock on" for the host and the guest. We can use the numeric keypad for the host and for the guest !



I use this qemu invocation

[CODE]
#!/bin/bash

qemu-kvm \
-enable-kvm \
-k fr \
-m 2048 \
-smp 2 \
-cpu host \
-vga qxl \
-device usb-ehci \
-device usb-mouse \
-device usb-kbd \
-device usb-tablet \
-device ich9-intel-hda \
-device hda-duplex,audiodev=snd0 \
-audiodev pa,id=snd0 \
-device usb-host,vendorid=0x046d,productid=0x08e5 \
-boot menu=on \
-nic bridge \

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
