hw/at24c : not support 1 byte-address with eeprom size less than 256 byte
Description of problem:
I created the new platform base on aspeed/fuji,
that uses the virtual eeprom (at24c), some eeprom used 24c02, which size 256 bytes.
but when using /hw/at24c.c, the result will not same the real device.
Steps to reproduce:
1. create a machine with EEPROM size less then or equal 256 bytes
2. start the qemu
3. use i2cget/i2cset/i2cdump to write and display eeprom data
Additional information:
I fixed and validated, refer
