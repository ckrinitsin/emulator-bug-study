xHCI Port Status Change Event at port powered

Per section 4.19.3 of the xHCI version 1.0 specification, when the Port Power bit transitions from 0 to 1, if there is a connection on that port, a Port Status Change Event should be issued.

Currently, when the port is powered, this event is not being issued.

I don't know the QEMU code base well enough to submit a patch, but I believe that when the port is powered, check to see if there is a connection (hence, setting the CCS and CSC bits), and then a call to:

xhci_port_notify(port, PORTSC_PLC);

will suffice.

Thank you,
Ben
