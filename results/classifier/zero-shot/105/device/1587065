btrfs qemu-ga - multiple mounts block fsfreeze

Having two mounts of the same device makes fsfreeze through qemu-ga impossible.
root@CmsrvMTA:/# mount -l | grep /dev/vda2
/dev/vda2 on / type btrfs (rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=257,subvol=/@)
/dev/vda2 on /home type btrfs (rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=258,subvol=/@home)

Having two mounts is rather common with btrfs, so the feature fsfreeze is unusable on these systems. 


Below more information about how we encountered this issue...

Message 1:
----------
I use external snapshots to backup my guests. I use the 'quiesce' option to flush and frees the guest file system with the qemu guest agent.

With the exeption of one guest, this procedure works fine. On the 'unwilling' guest, I get this error message:
"ERROR 2016-05-25 00:51:19 | T25-bakVMSCmsrvVH2 | fout: internal error: unable to execute QEMU agent command 'guest-fsfreeze-freeze': failed to freeze /: Device or resource busy"

I don't think this is not some sort of time-out error, because activation of the fsfreeze and the error message happen immediately after each other:

$ grep qemu-ga syslog.1
May 25 00:51:19 CmsrvMTA qemu-ga: info: guest-fsfreeze called

This is the only entry of the qemu guest agent in syslog.

$ sudo virsh version
Compiled against library: libvirt 1.3.1
Using library: libvirt 1.3.1
Gebruikte API: QEMU 1.3.1

$ virsh qemu-agent-command CmsrvMTA '{"execute": "guest-info"}'

For making an external snapshot, I use this command:
$ virsh snapshot-create-as --domain CmsrvMTA sn1 --disk-only --atomic --quiesce --no-metadata --diskspec vda,file=/srv/poolVMS/CmsrvMTA.sn1

Piece of reply 1:
-----------------
I have encountered this before. Some operating systems
 may have bind-mounts that let a device appear multiple times in the mount list. Unfortunately the guest agent is not smart enough to consider a device that has been frozen as succesfull and keep going. This causes this specific error.

Piece of reply 2:
-----------------
Ok, that seems to be it.

I’ve got the ‘/’ and ‘/home’ on the same device formatted as btrfs on two separate sub volumes.

I'm the responder from the Qemu list. I reviewed that C code a while ago when I stumbled over it. If someone helps me through the Qemu patch acceptance process then I'm willing to provide a patch.

I have a related Problem with a libvirt Guest running some Docker-Containers.

Thank you

Strangely I've started having the same problem as Tim this week, beside regular upgrade I did reboot since last backup... (Ubuntu LTS 16.04)

if I stop docker, the backup will proceed, otherwise i get the same failed to freeze / error message, even with no container running, just the daemon. That's both true with 1.11.2 and 1.12.1 docker dameon version.

I also have a path mounted twice, but this time it's devicemapper and not AUFS like tim, so maybe not fs type related.

This has been merged in upstream Qemu a while ago.

Was that this commit here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=ce2eb6c4a044d809c
?
That was included in QEMU v2.9.0, so I think we can set the status to "Fix released" now?

Any chance this will ever get backported to 2.5 on Xenial?
cheers!

You've got to open this (or a new bug) against Ubuntu's qemu package to get it included there. So far, this bug here is only opened against the upstream QEMU project.

This affects Ubuntu 16.04 as in #4




Fix is known and seems backportable, marking as server-next and subscribing for somebody to take a look.
Also as mentioned it is in 2.9, so newer releases are already fixed.

Steps to reproduce

uvt-simplestreams-libvirt --verbose sync --source http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/daily arch=amd64 release=xenial label=daily
uvt-kvm create --password ubuntu x-freeze arch=amd64 release=xenial label=daily

Add this to the guest definition and restart it
<channel type='unix'>
   <source mode='bind'/>
   <target type='virtio' name='org.qemu.guest_agent.0'/>
</channel>

From the host freeze and thaw it:
$ virsh domfsfreeze x-freeze
$ virsh domfsthaw x-freeze

# The above works

In the Guest then add a bind mount to trigger the issue
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/test
$ sudo mount -o bind / /mnt/test/

Then again try to freeze/unfreeze
$ virsh domfsfreeze x-freeze
error: Unable to freeze filesystems
error: internal error: unable to execute QEMU agent command 'guest-fsfreeze-freeze': failed to freeze /: Device or resource busy


I installed a fix from my PPA [1] and with that it works just fine now.
Proposing an MP for review by the team, to afterwards move on into SRU processing.

Tests are all ok, MP review was acked and case confirmed.
No Security Update since then in between, so sponsoring into SRU queue now ...
