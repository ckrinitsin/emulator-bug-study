Hang on Alder Lake with multiple cores
Description of problem:
The guest silently hangs after a few seconds or minutes. No output in log, no errors in guest.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start guest, do anything or nothing for a few minutes
Additional information:
More cores seem to make it less stable. With a single core, I haven't had a problem but at 8 cores it usually doesn't make it much past login on Windows or Linux.

The guests are stable with 8 cores if I pin the vcpus to P cores.
