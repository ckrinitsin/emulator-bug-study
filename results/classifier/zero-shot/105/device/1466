GTK: mouse position incorrect in HiDPI environment
Description of problem:
With `usb-tablet` mode the guest cursor position should be consistent with the host cursor since QEMU can position the mouse absolutely.
The guest position is off from the host cursor position, it seems the position is not being divided by the scaling factor before it is passed on to the guest.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run any guest with a graphical interface (e.g. Fedora Workstation or Windows 10)
2. Notice how the guest mouse is not consistent with the host mouse at all
