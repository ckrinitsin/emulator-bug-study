cmos RTC alarms no longer wake system from suspend

Running QEMU emulator version 2.0.0 (Debian 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.1), booting Linux kernels with qemu-system-x86_64 and qemu-system-i386, I no longer see the system resume from suspend when an RTC alarm is set.

My simple test application can be found here:
https://github.com/johnstultz-work/timetests/blob/master/alarmtimer-suspend.c

Previously this worked w/ QEMU 1.5  (bascially up until I upgraded from Ubuntu 13.10 to Ubuntu 14.04, which came with 2.0).

If a fix has already been committed, is there a branch or tag in the qemu git repo I should validate this with?

I went back and tried the 1.7 and 1.6 releases, and they both seem to have been broken as well wrt cmos alarms waking from suspend.

I assume this has been fixed in v2.1.0 or newer, like the "Fix committed" state indicates, so closing as "Fix released" now. In case there still something left to do here, feel free to re-open it.
