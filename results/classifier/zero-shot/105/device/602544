[Feature request] Please implement ATA TRIM command

Modern linuxes can use ATA TRIM command on block devices. It will be very nice if qemu translates this request to underlying block driver.

1. So, if I use RAW image (on my case - lvm partition), TRIM inside qemu should do TRIM command on my readl HDD
2. In the future, TRIM command inside qemu will free space inside qcow images.

This was indeed implemented through support for the DATA_SET_MANAGEMENT command, in hw/ide/core.c. If you are having specific issues here in 2016, please file a more specific bug.
