Qemu on Windows

I have a problem with the latest snapshot from http://qemu.weilnetz.de/.  Where should I raise it?  Here?  It's not clear to me that I should do it since that's probably an unsupported build, whereas there is no support forum or e-mail address on that website.

THanks.

Please describe the problem, maybe I can help you then. Yes, qemu.weilnetz.de contains experimental software which might contain bugs - see the comments on that site. If I get a qualified problem report, I usually try to fix it.

I have found the following symptoms with any combination of image and guest operating system, including Linux and freebsd, with qemu-system-x86_64 and qemu-system-sparc, so I'm pretty sure it's a systematic problem.  The images all boot fine on a Linux host.

What's happening is that the guest operating system bootloader finds the operating system and starts to boot, but it fails as soon as it tries to read /etc/init with messages implying it can't read the root filesystem.  This is strange because the booter has read it.  I wonder if the difference is that the booter uses polled I/O whereas the operating systems use DMA and interrupts?  What ever the reason is I'm baffled on how to proceed.

The host operating system is Windows 8.
