QEmu 1.7.0 cannot restore a 1.6.0 live snapshot made in qemu-system-x86_64

I have upgraded to QEmu 1.7.0 (Debian 1.7.0+dfsg-2) but now when I try to restore a live snapshot made in QEmu 1.6.0 (Debian 1.6.0+dfsg-1) I see that the VM boots from scratch instead of starting directly in the snapshot's running state.

Furthermore if the VM is already running and I try to revert to the snapshot again I get the following message:

$ virsh --connect qemu:///system snapshot-revert fgtbbuild wtb; echo $?
error: operation failed: Error -22 while loading VM state
1

I have test VMs with live snapshots corresponding to different testing configurations. So I typically revert the VMs in one of the live snapshots and run the tests. It would be pretty annoying to have to recreate all these live snapshots any time I upgrade QEmu bug it looks like I'll have to do it again.

This all sounds very much like bug 1123975 where QEmu 1.3 broke compatibility with previous versions live snapshots :-(

Here is the command being run by libvirt:

Hi Francois,
  I've managed to reproduce this, in my log file (/var/log/libvirt/qemu/machinename.log) I see:

Unknown ramblock "0000:02.0/qxl.vram", cannot accept migration
qemu: warning: error while loading state for instance 0x0 of device 'ram'
qemu-system-x86_64: Error -22 while loading VM state

do you also see that unknown ramblock warning?

(I'm running on F20 using 1.6.0 and 1.7.0 qemu's built from source running minimal F20 guests)

Hi Francois,
  I've done some more digging.
It looks like the problem you've hit is related to the same one that's fixed by:

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-11/msg00513.html

however that only fixes older restores ; there is a work around which is to pass to QEMU:

-global i440FX-pcihost.short_root_bus=1

on loading the snapshot; which can be done by editing the snapshot xml files - but is obviously a bit
messy.

Thanks for digging into this.
I am indeed getting the same ramblock error. So it's good that there appears to be a fix for it.
Also if I understand it correctly this particular issue only affects the 1.6.0 snapshots so given that most of my snapshots are still on 1.3.x a direct upgrade to 1.7+ will hopefully let me avoid the issue.

Yes, my understanding of the bug is that 1.7+ should load your 1.3.x images and then snapshots taken on 1.7.x should be OK into the future.

I don't think there's currently a way of fixing those 1.6.0 snapshots; that workaround will let you load them in 1.7, but I think if you were then to take a snapshot on 1.7 with that flag, the snapshot would have the same problem.

Setting status to "Won't fix" since there is no good solution to this problem according to comment #4.
