s390x TCG migration failure
Description of problem:
We're seeing failures running s390x migration kvm-unit-tests tests with TCG.

Some initial findings:

What seems to be happening is that after migration a control block header accessed by the test code is all zeros which causes an unexpected exception.

I did a bisection which points to c8df4a7aef ("migration: Split save_live_pending() into state_pending_*") as the culprit.
The migration issue persists after applying the fix e264705012 ("migration: I messed state_pending_exact/estimate") on top of c8df4a7aef.

Applying

```

on top fixes or hides the issue. (The comparison was removed by c8df4a7aef.)

I arrived at this by experimentation, I haven't looked into why this makes a difference.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run ACCEL=tcg ./run_tests.sh migration-skey-sequential with current QEMU master
2. Repeat until the test fails (doesn't happen every time, but still easy to reproduce)
