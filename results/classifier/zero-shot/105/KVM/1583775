Feature Request: qemu 2.6.0

Qemu 2.6.0 just got released, and according to changelogs it has quite some enhancements...

would it be possible to have someone who has a qemu ppa on launchpad to migrate this into his ppa?

thanks in advance

I'm testing a merge of it right now.

thank you very much serge=)

Hi; I'm going to close this because it isn't a bug in upstream QEMU (which only does source releases).
