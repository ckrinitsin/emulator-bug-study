Solaris/x86 v10 hangs under KVM

Solaris/x86 10 guest hangs when running under KVM with the message "Running Configuration Assistant".  It runs fine when -enable-kvm isn't given as a command option.

Host OS:  Linux/x86_64
Guest OS: Solaris/x86
Command Line: qemu -hda solaris.img -m 192 -boot c -enable-kvm
Build Configure:  ./configure --enable-linux-aio --enable-io-thread --enable-kvm

Your bug report doesn't tell us anything about the host system (AMD, Intel, which CPU model etc),
nor which version of KVM you are running, which distro etc?

Did it work with older versions of qemu-kvm?

Which version of Solaris/x86 (pointer to version preferably)

Please provide appropriate information if you want a chance that anyone will look at this.

1) Host CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU    Q6600  @ 2.40GHz
2) KVM doesn't have specific "versions" on Debian. The kernel is built with KVM included. The kernel is version 2.6.32-5
3) Debian 5.0
4) No - it's never worked for me, but I've only just got around to posting the bug
5) 10



As I mentioned in email reply, _every_ package in almost every distribution (the ones I know anyway), Debian included, has a version number attached.

The git commit ID (58aebb946acff82c62383f350cab593e55cc13dc) appears to be in qemu or qemu-kvm git tree (it's found on both), somewhere past 0.13.0-rc0 (dated Sep 18 2010).  But from this commit ID it's impossible to tell if you're using qemu or qemu-kvm.

What are you using --enable-io-thread for?





1: If you can give instructions on how to get a version number for kvm on Debian I'll follow them.  "dpkg -l | fgrep kvm" lists nothing.
2: I'm using the qemu git tree.  
3: Why are you asking?  Are you saying that enable-io-thread is broken with --enable-kvm?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
