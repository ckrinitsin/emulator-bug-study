VVFAT :rw writes from guest (ReactOS, windowsXP) not visible by host
Description of problem:
As described in https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-18327
While ./LMS is mounted as a :rw VVFAT drive, guest OS (ReactOS) is able to read files BUT when files are "written" from the guest, they are not visible on host side.
QEMU execution is also massively polluted by "invalid file name" messages coming from https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob_plain;f=block/vvfat.c;hb=HEAD (but this is not specific to the use with ReactOS, as this is also observed with other guest : WXP, ...)

See attached screenshot showing WXPSP3 as guest with file created in VVFAT drive while guest misses the newly created file.
