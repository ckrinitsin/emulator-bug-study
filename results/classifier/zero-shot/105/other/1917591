qemu-i386 under aarch64: Segfaulting on Steamcmd

I am trying to set up a Valheim server on my Raspberry Pi. I have installed the aarch64 image of Arm Arch Linux.

I installed qemu-user-static from the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qemu-user-static/
I have correctly set up binfmt support: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/binfmt-qemu-static-all-arch/

This allows me to successfully run i386 and amd64 docker images:

[alarm@server ~]$ sudo docker run --rm i386/debian uname -a
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/386) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested
Linux 9fd8d345b0aa 5.11.1-1-ARCH #1 SMP Tue Feb 23 20:00:47 MST 2021 i686 GNU/Linux

and

[alarm@server ~]$ sudo docker run --rm amd64/debian uname -a
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested
Linux 4f50fd228ab6 5.11.1-1-ARCH #1 SMP Tue Feb 23 20:00:47 MST 2021 x86_64 GNU/Linux

However, when I try to run the docker image that is going to host the server, the download of Valheim never succeeds because the used steamcmd application segfaults:

The following command successfully runs the server: sudo docker run -d --name valheim-server -p 2456-2458:2456-2458/udp -e SERVER_NAME="My Server" -e WORLD_NAME="Neotopia" -e SERVER_PASS="secret" lloesche/valheim-server

However, when we look into the container's logs via this command: sudo docker logs valheim-server

We see the following entry in the log file: ./steamcmd.sh: line 38:    86 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) $DEBUGGER "$STEAMEXE" "$@"

This means that the download never completes, and therefor the Valheim server is never actually started. Any help would be much appreciated. If there is anything unclear or if you need more details, please let me know!

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
