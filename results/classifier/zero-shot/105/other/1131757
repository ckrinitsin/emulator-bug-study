QEMU 1.4.0 fails to boot sparc64 linux image

Hi!

I tried to boot sparc64 linux image (http://packages.debian.org/sid/sparc64/linux-image-2.6-sparc64-smp/download) with qemu and received the  error.

host:~$qemu-system-sparc64 -nographic -kernel vmlinuz-3.2.0-4-sparc64-smp
OpenBIOS for Sparc64

Also, I tried to follow instruction from Artyom Tarasenko blog (http://tyom.blogspot.ru/2012/05/booting-linuxsparc64-on-todays-openbios.html), but it's still impossible to boot linux.

I don't see any change in behavior from 1.3.0 (haven't looked back
further). It appears to be attempting to boot garbage after the initial
load. From the blog you mentioned you can prevent this with the
-prom-env 'auto-boot?=false' option, which seems to work for me on both
1.3.0 and 1.4.0:

mdroth@loki:~/w/qemu-build2$ sparc64-softmmu/qemu-system-sparc64 -kernel
~/w/qemu-test-images/sparc/sparc-test/vmlinux-2.6.11+tcx -prom-env
'auto-boot?=false' -L pc-bios/ -nographic

Can you test with a full boot using an image/initrd? I'd point you to the
one at http://wiki.qemu.org/Testing but I've never managed to get it to
work:

sparc64-softmmu/qemu-system-sparc64 -kernel
~/w/qemu-test-images/sparc/sparc-test/vmlinux-2.6.11+tcx -initrd
~/w/qemu-test-images/sparc/sparc-test/linux.img -append "root=/dev/ram
console=ttyS0 video=tcxfb:off" -L pc-bios/ -nographic -m 16M
rom: requested regions overlap (rom
/home/mdroth/w/qemu-test-images/sparc/sparc-test/linux.img.
free=0x000001fff01b5fa0, addr=0x000001fff0000000)
rom loading failed

~/w/qemu-test-images/sparc/sparc-test/linux.img -append "root=/dev/ram

Would be great if you had another you could add to the wiki.

During testing of test image on sparc32 I found out that it is uncompressed.

I tried to make the same for sparc64 and the kernel works. Everything is ok.

Thank you for the answer, Michael!

This was  one of the first times  she's been around in a  while and  I was at work. She is very  aware of my presence, she just doesn't care. And the group of  friends is all  pretty loose about it. A few of them have slept with her, and  several of the  same  girls  that are  around occasionally so to  them I guess it's  all  just casual.
