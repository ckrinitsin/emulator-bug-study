qemu-system-aarch64 can't run Windows 10 for ARM version 2004

Problem: qemu-system-aarch64 can't run Windows 10 for ARM version 2004 (20H2) or newer

Host OS: Windows 10 x64 version 20H2
CPU    : Intel Pentium Dual-core T4300 (no vt-x)
QEMU   : QEMU version 5.1.0 from qemu.org

cmdline: qemu-system-aarch64.exe -M virt -cpu cortex-a72 -smp 3 --accel tcg,thread=multi -m 2048 -pflash QEMU_EFI.img -pflash QEMU_VARS.img -device VGA -device nec-usb-xhci -device usb-kbd -device usb-mouse -device usb-storage,drive=cdrom -drive file="isofile.iso",media=cdrom,if=none,id=cdrom

Note: QEMU_VARS and QEMU_EFI are taken from edk2, which can be seen in the attachment below.

Details: From this post (https://kitsunemimi.pw/notes/posts/running-windows-10-for-arm64-in-a-qemu-virtual-machine.html) and from what I have tried, QEMU can't run Windows ARM newer or equal to the 2004 version. When we boot a 2004 iso (made from uupdump.ml), it stuck as the boot screen with the Windows ARM logo and nothing else. When I check the machine state and registers through the QEMU monitor, it shows that the VM is still running, but the registers are completely frozen! But if I try the older version, like 19H2, it works! Please help!



The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
