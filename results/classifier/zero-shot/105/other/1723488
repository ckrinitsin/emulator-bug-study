HAX on Windows, memory lease error

Today I tried to use QEMU on Windows 8.1 x64 with Intel HAX.

Command line: qemu-system-x86_64.exe -accel hax -m 8000 -hda /opt/disk/ubuntu.img -cdrom /opt/iso/ubuntu-17.04-server-amd64.iso

Host machine has 32Gb physical memory, I got error:

HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virt mode.
**
ERROR:A:/msys64/home/admin/git/qemu/target/i386/hax-mem.c:210:hax_process_section: assertion failed: (size <= UINT32_MAX)

When using -m 4000 (and below) everything is fine. But if I try use >4000 and <8000 I get crash with errors:

HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virt mode.

It seems that HAX not working at all:

qemu-system-x86_64.exe -accel hax -fda /opt/iso/freedos.img
(with image of boot floppy from official FreeDOS site)

See https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/installation-instructions-for-intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager-windows:

"QEMU or Android Emulator will fail to launch if the guest RAM size (specified with the -m option for QEMU or -memory for Android Emulator) exceeds 4095MB."

HAX is limited to a 32 bit memory size. There is no way to change that without breaking compatibility.

The main problem is that HAX currently doesn't work properly at all on my both Windows 8.1 and Mac OS X 10.12.6 machines. 
I can give other examples  if it is necessary

Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
