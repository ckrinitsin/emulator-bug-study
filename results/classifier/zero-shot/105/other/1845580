issue with QEMU on Raspberry Pi failing to access CDROM

I am trying to access the CDROM (iso) from QEMU using FreeDOS and I get an error when doing a directory for:

i can boot from the iso but if i exit to access the files from the CDROM ISO i get the attached error.

I believe there is an issue with the QEMU for the Raspberry Pi.

I am using a Raspberry Pi3 with the latest full Raspbian Buster load



Can you provide the full QEMU command line, please, and any other instructions/information/images that would be needed to reproduce the bug.

Does the same command work on an x86 Linux host?


The command line I am using is:

qemu-system-i386 -hda freedos.hd -cdrom FD12CD.iso -boot order=d

The above command works on a x86 Linux Ubuntu 18.04LTS system without issues.

1. I downloaded FreeDOS1.2 iso
2. created a blank image with 'qemu-img create freedos.hd 200M' command
3. Started qemu with:

qemu-system-i386 -hda freedos.hd -cdrom FD12CD.iso -boot order=d

Will boot from the ISO but when going through the setup QEMU no longer has access to the CDROM when needing to copy the packages over.  I drop exit out of the setup program to a MSDOS prompt and that's when I see the error when trying to display a directory from the CDROM.

  

Which version of QEMU are you using? If it's anything older than 4.1, please update to 4.1. There was a bug in QEMU somewhen between 2.12 and 4.0 which looks like the one you reported.

I checked with qemu-system-i386 --version and it reports version 3.1.0

I installed via sudo apt-get install qemu, does this mean I will have to compile qemu 4.1 for the raspberry or is the a binary somewhere I can install?



I compiled 4.1.0 on the Raspberry, everything seemed to compile. 

I have verified with qemu-system-i386 --version displays 4.1.0 

Using the below basic command line:

qemu-system-i386 -hda c.hda -cdrom FD12CD.iso -boot order=d

now when I try to execute the qemu I get only below as it just seems to hang:


WARNING: Image format was not specified for 'c.hda' and probing guessed raw.
         Automatically detecting the format is dangerous for raw images, write operations on block 0 will be restricted.
         Specify the 'raw' format explicitly to remove the restrictions.

Looks like you've compiled your binary without graphical user interface. Either use a VNC-viewer to have a look at ":1", or try to install gtk2-devel or sdl2-devel, and run "configure" and "make" again.

Alternatively, not sure whether it works, but maybe worth a try, you could also try to use the BIOS from QEMU 4.1 with the pre-compiled QEMU 3.1 from your Linux distro. Use "-bios .../pc-bios/bios-256k.bin" when you run QEMU for this.

Thank you for the info.

I installed the gtk2 and sdl2 development libraries recompiled and 4.1.0 now runs successfully and that also fixed the original issue I was seeing.



All right, so this was the known issue. Let's close this bug :-)
