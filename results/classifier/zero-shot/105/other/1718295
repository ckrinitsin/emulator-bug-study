Live migration fails with qemu-img >= 2.10: "Failed to get shared "write" lock\nIs another process using the image?"

Looks like this is pretty new:

I don't see any related nova changes in the last 48 hours that look like they could cause this. I wonder if there is a new qemu package or something.

qemu-system                        1:2.10+dfsg-0ubuntu1~cloud0

qemu-system 1:2.10+dfsg-0ubuntu1~cloud0 was released on 9/5 so we've already been using it for a couple of weeks.

It's probably this change to devstack to use the pike cloud archive:

    The jobs that run live migration tests are failing at about
    a rate of 50% since this merged. There are no recent changes
    to nova in the last 24 hours that are related to live
    migration, and this is failing on the master branch only,
    so I suspect the failures are due to new qemu packages
    getting pulled in from this change.

This is a behavioural change in qemu for 2.10 - looks like 'qemu-img info' needs to be passed a '--force-share' option to allow it to read a disk file for a running instance.

This appears like it might be an issue with the ppa in pike

Since it is a wanted behavioral change in upstream qemu setting that task to "Won't Fix" unless we come up with a reason to convince qemu to do so.
Once might argue that info should imply force-share or such, but unless we do so make clear that no qemu change is expected.
James already mentioned bug 1718133.

@James and Matt - should we dup one of those onto the other?

Distro patch to unblock Ubuntu Pike UCA and Artful (needs conditional check for general consumption).

Setting Nova bug task back to 'New' as I think we do need to accommodate this behavioural change in qemu.

    Support qemu >= 2.10
    
    Qemu 2.10 added the requirement of a --force-share flag to qemu-img
    info when reading information about a disk that is in use by a
    guest. We do this a lot in Nova for operations like gathering
    information before live migration.
    
    Up until this point all qemu/libvirt version matching has been solely
    inside the libvirt driver, however all the image manip code was moved
    out to nova.virt.images. We need the version of QEMU available there.
    
    This does it by initializing that version on driver init host. The net
    effect is also that broken libvirt connections are figured out
    earlier, as there is an active probe for this value.

This issue was fixed in the openstack/nova 17.0.0.0b1 development milestone.

This issue was fixed in the openstack/nova 16.0.2 release.

I think I am experiencing this issue on 15.1.13

If it's not going to be backported to O can anyone suggest a workaround?

@Filippo: your options are (1) use an older version of QEMU or (2) backport the change to your Ocata-based deployment and run with it out of tree.

hi , because of power outage, Most of our compute nodes  unexpectedly shut  down and now I can't start our instances. I am getting "Failed to get "write" lock Is another process using the image?" error. Full error log is  http://paste.openstack.org/show/754107/. My environment is OpenStack Pike and Instances are on a nfs shared storage. Nova version is 16.1.6.dev2. This fix can not solve this problem completely. What would you suggest for solve this problem ?

Maybe your files are still in locked state on the NFS system.
That you chould check with qemu-img operations, no need to start the guest.
If they are you might need to remove that lock bit (not sure how atm).
