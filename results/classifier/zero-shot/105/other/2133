Debian sparc64 works on hardware, segfaults in qemu
Description of problem:

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start the installer normally (boot cdrom), use guided all disk partition, change ext4 to btrfs for /
2. Installer always segfaults at the same place while installing base system step:

```
Additional information:
All times i've tried under Ubuntu qemu or latest build for Windows it segfaults unpacking package, and i believe it's a misleading error message, since very same ISO installs normally on Sun Fire T1000 machine (sun4v). I've tried also booting FreeBSD-12.4-RELEASE-sparc64-disc1.iso which dies shortly after booting the kernel, but i am more interested in Debian, since it was verified to work on a real hardware. BTW i was able to unpack specified file with "ar x" within installer.
