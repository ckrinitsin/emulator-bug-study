FreeBSD 9.2 shell crashes when run with -smp 4 option

This is a bug that i have noticed in qemu 1.7.50 as well as 1.1.50. It was the latter that forced me to clone the repository to check if this is the case with the resent version as well . The latest commit on which the bug is found is f53f3d0a00b6df39ce8dfca942608e5b6a9a4f71 on qemu.git

configured with target list i386-softmmu
and then 
make
 
OS: FreeBSD 9.2 Text Install ISO
Installed it to a qcow2 format image.

./i386-softmmu/qemu-system-i386 -hda <bsd-image> -m 2G -smp 4 -net nic -net user -monitor stdio

(boot into multi-user mode)->(login to root account)

I have the filebench benchmark installed on the image and when i run it the default root shell (csh) crashes with the error.
[pid xxxx (csh) sigreturn eflag = 0xXXXX]
Here is the piece of kernel code that is getting executed (i think) http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/release/9.2.0/sys/i386/i386/machdep.c?view=markup#l1095 

Here is a related bug
https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/458

The crash happens randomly. It is not just related with filebench. 
Here are a few scenarios:
* When i run fileserver workload of filebench
* After i issue the shutdown -h now shutdown -r now commands
* Issuing mount -t linprocfs proc /proc

Moreover it is not guaranteed that the above scenarios will reproduce it (reliably). 
Basically after running some commands and getting the CPU and the kernel worked up i think.

Hi,

just to be clear, are you saying that commit f53f3d0a00b6df39ce8df fixes the bug, or that that is the latest commit with which you tested?  (since it was Mar 8 :)

I tested on the commit f53f3d0a00b6df39ce8df 

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
