add '--targets' option to qemu-binfmt-conf.sh

I'd like to ask for the addition of option '--targets' to scripts/qemu-binfmt-conf.sh, in order to allow registering the interpreters for the given list of architectures only, instead of using all of the ones defined in qemu_target_list. The following is a possible patch that implements it:

Please send your patch to the qemu-devel mailing list.

I think it's a good idea but we should homogenize "--debian" and 
"--systemd": remove the parameter from  "--systemd" to generate by 
default all the targets, and allow the user to provide a subset of the 
targets using the newly introduced "--target" parameter.

Thanks,
Laurent



I submitted a first version some days ago, which homogeneized the implementation, as suggested by Laurent Vivier. It received some feedback from Eric Blake. A patchset (v3) is ready for review: https://patchew.org/QEMU/20190306031221.GA53@03612eec87fc/#

The feature requested in this issue is included in the patchset:

[Qemu-devel] [PATCH v3 6/10] qemu-binfmt-conf.sh: generalize <CPU> to positional <CPUS> 
https://patchew.org/QEMU/20190306031221.GA53@03612eec87fc/20190306045019.GF75@03612eec87fc/

Note that, instead of adding a parameter named `--target`, positional arguments are used, which where not being processed at all.

This series appears to have stalled as of v7: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-03/msg04241.html -- moving back to 'New' status.


The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
