target/mips/op_helper.c:971:duplicated branches ?

qemu-4.2.0/target/mips/op_helper.c:971:8: warning: this condition has identical branches [-Wduplicated-branches]

Source code is

   if (other_tc == other->current_tc) {
        tccause = other->CP0_Cause;
    } else {
        tccause = other->CP0_Cause;
    }

Possible cut'n'paste error ?

Hi Thomas,

Sorry but I barely recall yesterday, 2011 was a long time ago... It does
look weird.

IIRC smp was kinda of working but the multithreading support wasn't. Some
of these paths were probably not tested too much at the time.

Cheers,
Edgar
