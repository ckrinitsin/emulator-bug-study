qemu hangs on live-migration with storage(virtual machine: windows Server 2008 with only one disk )

Hi,
We are using “Windows Server 2008” with qemu-kvm-2.0.1 (linux kernel:3.10.0) as a host of  a VM.
Using drive_mirror to do  live-migration on the same host for different disks
Local disk: /sf/data/local/
Shared disk(iscsi): /sf/other/local/    ---  the disk is busy, the IO rate is  about  30MB/s
qemu-system-x86_64 -k en-us -m 2048 -smp 2 -vnc :3100 -usbdevice tablet -boot c -enable-kvm -drive file=/sf/data/local/vm-disk-1.qcow2,if=none,id=drive-ide0,cache=none,aio=native -device ide-hd,bus=ide.0,unit=0,drive=drive-ide0,id=ide0,bootindex=100 

Step 1:
Start migration: Drive_mirror -f drive-ide0  /sf/other/local/test.qcow2

Step 2:
When detect the migration has completed, then send cmd: block_job_complete -f drive-ide0

Step 3:
send cmd: info status 
What surprised me is that the qemu monitor reports can’t be connected.

Then find bellows:
The  qemu process hangs on the mirror_run->bdrv_drain_all->aio_poll->qemu_poll_ns->ppoll (),
None events were received and poll forever. I don’t know why the aio can’t be responsed. This case is hardly to
be generated but it really happens sometimes . I’m looking forward to getting help from you .
The stack capture snapshot:


Thanks 
MyAngle

Please give the exact qemu-kvm package version and Linux distro name.
The code in qemu.git/master is slightly different so maybe the issue no
longer happens, but it would be worth looking at the exact source code
your qemu-kvm is built from.

I have CCed Jeff Cody, who maintains drive-mirror.

[Halsey] I also recreated this issue today, qemu hangs at bdrv_rw-co() -> bdrv_prwv_co() -> aio_poll(0 -> qemu_poll_ns() -> ppoll().  I'm just call bdrv_write to write data to qcow2 file. My qemu version is qemu-2.2.0.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
