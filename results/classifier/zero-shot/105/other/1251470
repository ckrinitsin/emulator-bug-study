Guest not working in KVM mode but does in TCG mode

Qemu: 1.5.0 (Debian 1.5.0+dfsg-3ubuntu5)
Host: Ubuntu 13.10 x86_64 (Intel Core i7-950)
Guest: FreeBSD 9.2 RELEASE x86_64

As initially reported here: https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2013-November/msg00066.html
I was told that this is a bug in Qemu.

Basically this command works:
qemu-system-x86_64 -hda images/FreeBSD-9.2-RELEASE-amd64.img

But this one doesn't:
qemu-system-x86_64 -machine accel=kvm -hda images/FreeBSD-9.2-RELEASE-amd64.img

FreeBSD is stuck after the bootloader:
Booting...
CPU doesn't support long mode

Same behaviour with git master (5c5432e7d630592ddcc1876ac8a1505f8f14ef15)

I'll download FreeBSD 9.2 and debug it. In the meanwhile, does it work with an additional option "-cpu Nehalem"?

For what it's worth, with 1.7.0+dfsg-3ubuntu6 and using the image FreeBSD-9.2-RELEASE-amd64-bootonly.iso kvm is working for me.

saucy has seen the end of its life and is no longer receiving any updates. Marking the saucy task for this ticket as "Won't Fix".

According to comment #3, this bug has been fixed, so I'm closing this ticket now. If you can still reproduce this issue with the latest version from QEMU, please feel free to open this ticket again.
