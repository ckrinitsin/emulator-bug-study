tap connections not working on windows host

using latest qemu 2.2.0 64bit for windows host (installed from qemu-w64-setup-20141210.exe obtained from http://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/  ),OpenVPN 2.6.3-I601 64bit tap adapter named tap01 and calling qemu using the following.

qemu-system-x86_64.exe -m 512 -net nic -net tap,ifname=tap01 -hda "c:\\data\\images\\test.img"

where the image contains a slackware 14.0 64bit install.
The tap is bridged with the real network adapter and the bridge is given an ip of 10.1.1.41 (which works as the ip for the windows host). The tap adapter (in network connections) shows connected when the qemu vm is running. inside the vm, the network is given an ip of 10.1.1.143 (the netmask and default gateway are the same for the virtual and real pc).
fault.
The vm cannot see the rest of the local network or visa-versa. This used to work in early (0.9 32bit) versions of qemu.

same behaviour observed with qemu 2.2.0 32bit version for windows host

Please try tcpdump or Wireshark on guest and host to check whether ping
works in either direction.

have used wireshark on host and nothing is coming through when I try to ping the host from the client. (bare with me as I haven't used wireshark before).
  I'm just upgrading the client to slack64 14.1 so I can get wireshark running on it. (process is a little slow, especially with no functioning network on the client). If all goes well, I'll be able to test that by tomorrow (it took about 5hours to install last time). I'll then post back here. 
If there are any specific tests or methods I could follow that would help please let me know.

Please post the following output from the guest:

  # ip addr
  # ip route
  # iptables -L -n

This way we can verify that the guest's network interface is configured,
up, and has no firewall rules that could filter packets.

Please post output from the "ipconfig /all" command on the Windows host.

The output from the guest shows that IP traffic from guest to host or
external network should go through 10.1.1.88.

When you watch traffic inside the guest, you should see ARP Who-Has
10.1.1.88 to look up the MAC address of the gateway.

If a response makes it back to the guest, then the guest will send IP
packets with the Ethernet destination address of the gateway.

This approach depends on the host bridging traffic between the physical
network and the guest...

Not sure why there are two tunnel adapters with the same
00-00-00-00-00-00-00-E0 MAC address.  Could be a Windows thing, I
haven't used tun/tap under Windows.

Thanks for the information.

Since it's not clear whether the bridge configuration on the host is the
problem, I suggest removing the bridge:

Statically assign the tap interface on the host a local IP address like
192.168.5.1.

Statically assign 192.168.5.2 inside the guest.

See if guest and host can ping each other successfully.

This will show whether the problem is QEMU's tap networking or whether
the problem is the bridge configuration on the host.

Stefan


I have tried what you suggested (breaking the bridge on the host, and giving the host tap 192.168.5.1 and the guest eth0 192.168.5.2
and tried pinging one from the other. I get 100% packet loss.
This points to QEMU's tap networking as far as I can see.
I have tried uninstalling the 64 bit version and installing the 32bit tap adapter (and bridging it) from openvpn 2.3.6-I601  but that didn't seem to make any difference.

I tried using a very old qemu (0.11.1) with qemu manager and the 32bit tap adapter and bridge set up (using the same disk image but specifying intel  E1000 netcard for the vm) and that works.
so some time between 0.11.1 and 2.0 tap networking has got broken.

I can spend some more time trying stuff out if you have any suggestions. There must be some people actually using the windows host qemu and tap somewhere! :-)
(I don't have any problems running with a linux host and tap bridged network - well a few errors, but it (networking) seems to work anyway)

I can concur that I am having the same problem on a Windows host.

I also confirm the problem on Windows 7 host. 

I tried the following over the past few nights:
Downloaded the OpenVPN tap 32 adapter. Installed it and gave it a different network address (192.168.200.10) to my normal LAN (192.168.1.10). Bridged the 2 connections, which gets me a new IP via DHCP at the bridge (192.168.1.101). 

Got latest QEMU 2.2.0 for Windows from \lassauge.free.fr.
Got linux images from https://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/armel/ and used the command as per the instructions there. Further added the -net tap swithches to the cmd line, similar to above.

Debian guest boots up ok, but TAP networking is not happening, no matter what combinations or permutations i've tried to configure the guest net iface. 

On the other hand, I obtained dsl-4.4.10-embedded.zip  which comes with its own QEMU from http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/damnsmalllinux.org/current/. After changing the command line to start QEMU with the -tap switch, and configuring dsl for dhcp, i was up and running immediately (automagically obtained its own ip as my host network as 192.168.1.102, same gateway as host network, pings ok in either direction, even pings google.com). This proves the tap adapter and bridge is configured correctly on the host side, and the supplied QEMU version works ok - can't tell exactly which QEMU version but it is circa 2006.

After this attempt i've tried other versions of QEMU 1.6.0, and 1.1.1 with the same debian client still the same problem. i.e. boots up ok except for the TAP networking.

It is most likely a QEMU problem, but i am amazed at the number of blog posts of ppl claiming it to be working. It is unlikely they used a recent QEMU version.

I'm having the same problem here on Windows 7 x64 host trying to run Raspbian.

You could put a fprintf(stderr, "Receiving a packet\n") into
net/tap-win32.c:tap_win32_send() as well as fprintf(stderr, "Sending a
packet\n") into tap_win32_write() if you think QEMU's Windows tap code
is broken.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

i'll check with a more recent version and report back

it is working now. using the following config.
"c:\program files\qemu\qemu-system-i386.exe" -cpu qemu32 -m 3G -drive file="c:\\data\\images\\slack14.2_32bit_base.qcow2",format=qcow2 -cdrom "c:\\data\\images\\slackware-14.2-install-dvd.iso" -boot c -net nic,macaddr=02:00:00:11:11:14,model=i82551 -net tap,ifname=tap0 -k en-gb -display vnc=:2 -monitor telnet:localhost:7101,server,nowait,nodelay
which I took from a linux qemu vm of mine, and just modified the bridge to point to tap (it didn't like -net bridge,br=br0 (where br0 was my windows bridge - I guess there is no bridge helper on windows qemu - so I changed it to -net tap,ifname=tap0 (which was already configured as part of the bridge)
I was able to ping the lan and also the wan (internet) so it looks ok now. This time i did specify a different virtual net card which may have made a difference, but if it works, that is the main thing.

addition to previous comment. it works with qemu-w64-setup-20180519.exe
I haven't tested it with in between versions of qemu.

ok, thanks for checking! So I'm closing this ticket now...

... ah, well, never mind, just saw that you already closed it :-)

"it works with qemu-w64-setup-20180519.exe"

Do i need to install some tap adapers on windows??

when i install tap driver from https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html im able to start with tap01 (when i rename the tap interface to "tap01"..)

but on start i get an apipa address with that config:

why??

static ip does also not work, can't reach other machines in my own subnet:

???

problem solved! :-)



hi jan, would you care to elaberate for the benefit of everyone "out there".

Hi,

I want to run u-boot for x86_64 architecture in windows10 and I am using qemu-5.0.0, the latest version of qemu. The TAP adapter for Linux (host) worked successfully and I communicated between u-boot (guest) and Linux (host), but the result for Windows (host) failed.

I installed the Tap Network Adapter for windows and renamed it to "tap0" . when I ran the qemu with the following command without creating a bridge, u-boot was successfully initialized, but I cannot ping Windows (host).
qemu-system-x86_64.exe -bios u-boot.rom -nographic -device  e1000,netdev=mynet0 -netdev tap,id=mynet0,ifname=tap0

When I check (right click> status) for Tap0 it says No Network Connection.
I terminated qemu and connected tap0 to the internet using the config files I downloaded for OpenVPN.
When I checked tap0 again, I saw "Ipv4: Internet" but when I try to run qemu this way, I get an error like this.

tap: Could not open 'tap0'
qemu-system-x86_64.exe: Device 'tap' could not be initialized




What was the fix that took place in the mainstream qemu? I'm facing the same issue on the latest Android Emulator (emulator: Android qemu version 30.3.5.0 (build_id 7033400) (CL:N/A)) on Windows 10.

TAP network gets attached just fine and shows us as eth1 on guest in ifconfig. But cannot ping the host. Tried removing the bridge i.e with just the standalone TAP adapter by assigning 192.168.5.2 to the host-side adapter and 192.168.5.3 to the guest-side - the guest cannot ping 192.168.5.2.

What was the actual fix? Maybe I can check if the fix got picked up or not on Google's emulator repo.

Varun Chitre: I'm not sure the fix was identified, but this one stood out in the git log:
