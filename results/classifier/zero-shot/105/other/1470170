Unsupported syscalls 370 and 355

Qemu seems to be missing syscalls 370 and 355 when running qemu usermode arm. These are used by systemd or some similar new package. This can be detected by creating an debian sid armhf with qemu debootstrap. When the system is launched with "systemd-nspawn -bD sid-arm" this happens (newest git as of today):

Syscall 370 is name_to_handle_at, and 355 is signalfd4. (Likely if name_to_handle_at succeeds then it'll want open_by_handle_at too.)

This patch implements the signalfd syscalls, though we haven't got to reviewing it yet.

It looks like systemd is coping with 370 not being implemented, so that might be enough to get it running.

I have also a patch for name_to_handle_at:

https://github.com/vivier/qemu-m68k/commit/2ebda8d4578345a60dadc4d85cfb1b8d69b8aa10

I've written open_by_handle_at for testing purpose. It is not needed by
systemd.

https://github.com/vivier/qemu-m68k/commit/030b720a0ba75a81ec689621f4fac696ccbff22d

I can post them if needed.

I'm also trying to boot systemd (fedora 21/ppc64).

But, for me, this is not enough. Netlink seems needed too.
I'm working on this...

Laurent,

I just encountered the same missing syscall on qemu-m68k:

This just happened for the first time and it's apparently related to very recent versions of systemd (228).

Fix has been committed upstream.
