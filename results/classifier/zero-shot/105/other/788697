[PowerPC] [patch] mtmsr does not preserve high bits of MSR

The mtmsr instruction on 64-bit PPC does not preserve the high-order 32-bits of the MSR the way it is supposed to, instead setting them to 0, which takes 64-bit code out of 64-bit mode. There is some code that does the right thing, but it brokenly only preserves these bits when the thread is not in 64-bit mode (i.e. when it doesn't matter). The attached patch unconditionally enables this code when TARGET_PPC64 is set, per the ISA spec, which fixes early boot failures trying to start FreeBSD/powerpc64 under qemu.

Please send the patch as proper patch to the ML and CC me.

What isn't proper about the patch? I'm happy to re-email it, but don't 
want things to be in the wrong format.

The patch needs a patch description in its header and a subject line (all of which are present in the bug, so it's a simple matter of copy&paste). Basically at the end of the day, I should be able to save the mail and "git am" on it and simply have it in my tree :).

Also, does this get FreeBSD booting up to anything useful, so I can verify it helps?

OK, I'll send this one out to today. The other issue I'm having (aside 
from our own bugs), is that SPR_PIR is not implemented for the POWER7 
target. The architecture manual claims it is implemented on all Book-3S 
compliant CPUs, but it seems to be implemented sort of ad-hoc in 
target-ppc.c (e.g. the 604, 620, and 7400 have it, but not the 750, 970, 
or POWER7).

So the reason POWER7 doesn't have it is probably because it simply does the same as 970. Why 970 doesn't register PIR, I don't know, but to me it sounds like a plain bug :). Just send a patch, CC me and David Gibson.

As far as I can see, the issue has been fixed here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=8018dc63aab936f1a5
... so closing this ticket now.
