I have a virtual raspberry py that I am running qemu 5.1.0 for MacOS.

Here is the command line I used:

qemu-system-arm \
  -M versatilepb \
  -cpu arm1176 \
  -m 256 \
  -drive file=2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.img,if=none,index=0,media=disk,format=raw,id=disk0 \
  -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=disk0,disable-modern=on,disable-legacy=off \
  -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::5022-:22 \
  -dtb versatile-pb-buster-5.4.51.dtb \
  -kernel kernel-qemu-5.4.51-buster \
  -append "root=/dev/vda2 panic=1" \
  -no-reboot \
  -serial stdio

When trying to ssh from another machine while docker was running inside the VM, I got the following error:

Assertion failed: (buf_len != 0), function soread, file /private/tmp/qemu-20200813-13289-1g95loa/qemu-5.1.0/slirp/src/socket.c, line 183

libslirp is a separate project now, and I see that you already reported it there (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/slirp/libslirp/-/issues/29), so I'm closing this QEMU ticket now.

Hmm, thinking about it twice, maybe let's rather keep this open, to make sure that we update to the right version of libslirp in QEMU once the fix is released there.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
