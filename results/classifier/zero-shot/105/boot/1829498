window 8 stuck during boot on Qemu 

Description of problem:
I've got windows 8 image(64 bit), installed on Qemu(x86-64_softmmu) and then i'm trying to boot/shutdown it in the same Qemu configuration. Windows 8 has feature - when you click "Shutdown" in UI, windows 8 doesn't actually power off, it goes to "Suspend to disc" ACPI state. After shutdown, i'm trying to boot it again, but it stucks during boot.

I've discovered, that it hangs when windows 8 writes to AHCI's command register, AHCI triggers irq, but windows 8 sends EOI, don't accessing AHCI register,so irq line stills in high state, and irq will be injected again and again, while windows will send EOI on each AHCI interrupt. Strange thing is that it happens only on TCG mode or 
with option "kernel-irqchip=off/split", with "kernel-irqchip=on" everything works ok(windows 8 accesses AHCI register and line goes to low state).

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
Qemu revision: d8276573da58e8ce78dab8c46dd660efd664bcb7


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Windows 8 on QEMU(qemu command line: "-enable-kvm -m 1G -hda <image>  -serial stdio  -cpu core2duo -machine q35,kernel-irqchip=off"
2. Click shutdown in UI.
3. Try to boot again(it will stuck)
4. Kill Qemu and boot again, it will boot, now go to 2) :)

What host kernel are you using? This sounds like a bug we used to have in KVM a while ago. Maybe it's back.

The same problem was also alleviated by a guest driver update, are you using the initial release of Windows 8?



My host kernel is 4.15.0-47. Windows 8 version is 6.3.9600. About KVM, i've got same problem in TCG mode.

Drats, okay. I will investigate. (I can always hope for the easy answer...)

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
