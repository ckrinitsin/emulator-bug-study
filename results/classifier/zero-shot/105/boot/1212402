Enabling KVM with recent QEMU builds from GIT hang at boot on Ubuntu Precise AMD64 kernel 3.8.0

When I compile QEMU from GIT and run it with './x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm' it just hangs, the QEMU screen stays black. (Everything else in the GTK UI is responsive though, I can use the QEMU console as well.)
I'm running Ubuntu Precise with kernel 3.8.0-27-generic on an Intel Core2 Duo P9500.

With bisecting, I found this commit caused the problem:

    kvm: support using KVM_MEM_READONLY flag for regions

    For readonly memory regions and rom devices in romd_mode,
    we make use of the KVM_MEM_READONLY. A slot that uses
    KVM_MEM_READONLY can be read from and code can execute from the
    region, but writes will exit to qemu.

    For rom devices with !romd_mode, we force the slot to be
    removed so reads or writes to the region will exit to qemu.
    (Note that a memory region in this state is not executable
    within kvm.)

    v7:
     * Update for readable => romd_mode rename (5f9a5ea1)

We have discussed this issue in this mail:

not boot after commit 235e898)

You can upgrade your kernel to 3.9.x to work around.

It seems reverting this exact commit also works around the problem. I have attached a patch against current head.

According to comment #1, this has been fixed with kernel 3.9, so setting the status to "Fix released" now.
