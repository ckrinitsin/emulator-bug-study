IPv6 DHCPv6 DUID-UUID Generation Issue with iPXE on QEMU 8.1.2 and SMBIOS 3.0
Description of problem:
I'm creating this ticket in both projects affected as I'm unsure which side needs to resolve it. I discovered this bug after upgrading Proxmox to version 8.1. I use iPXE to boot in IPv6 and retrieve the configuration from a web server. I have a DHCPv6 and SLAAC server configured.

In this configuration, iPXE is unable to generate the necessary DUID-UUID for IPv6. If I revert to the previous QEMU version (using the machine: pc-i440fx-8.0 option in Proxmox), I have no issues. The only difference I notice and understand is the switch to SMBIOS 3.0, which is 64 bits, compared to SMBIOS 2.8, which is 32 bits. It appears to be the same issue with Libvirt. By default, it uses pc-q35-8.1, and I encounter the bug. However, if I switch to pc-q35-8.0, the problem is resolved.

I've included two sets of information in the first part. The first one is from my local computer using libvirt, making it easier to reproduce the bug. The second set is from my production environment.

Here's the iPXE trace:

```plaintext
iPXE>  ifconf --configurator ipv6
Configuring [ipv6] (net0 66:b5:3e:97:7d:4e)...
DHCPv6 net0 could not create DUID-UUID: No such file or directory (https://ipxe.org/2d0c203b)
No such file or directory (https://ipxe.org/2d0c203b)
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a PXE ISO with IPv6 debug options:
   1. Clone the iPXE repository with the following command:
      * `git clone https://github.com/ipxe/ipxe`
   2. Navigate to the src directory:
      * `cd ipxe/src`
   3. Build the iPXE ISO with IPv6 debug options using the following command:
      * `DEBUG='dhcpv6,neighbour' make bin/ipxe.iso`
2. Set up a Libvirt network with DHCPv6 enabled (example configuration provided in the next section).
3. Create a virtual machine with the generated iPXE ISO and the network configured for IPv6.
4. Press `Ctrl+B` to access the iPXE shell.
5. Execute the command `ifconf --configurator ipv6` in the iPXE shell.
