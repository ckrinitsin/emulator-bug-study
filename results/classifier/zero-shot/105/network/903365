[feature request] bind nat (-net user) to other interface (like eth0:2)

-net user mode is very nice because it does not require any changes in host system. However if host system has muplitple IPs You cant use it, or even switch to another. Qemu should be able to "bind" to eth0:1 eth0:2 so that outgoing traffic uses this interface and thus other IP.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
