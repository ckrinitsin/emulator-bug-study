hw/esp.c does not properly deal with TEST_UNIT_READY in NetBSD/sparc

The NetBSD ncr53c9x.c driver does a TEST_UNIT_READY command with SELATN but dma disabled sometimes (early during bus enumeration). This is fine, as the command will not produce nor consume any data, and works on real hardware.

However, the qemu emulation does not allow this (for reasons I don't understand).

The change below fixes the problem.



Guess I understand the code now - so here is a working version - though it may be considered slightly hackish

Please see this on how to contribute patches to QEMU:

Patch removed, as it was bogus and your workflow is weird, so I'll post a better patch to the devel list

Has this problem been fixed in 2012, so that we could close this ticket now? Or is there still something left to do?

Yes. Just to make sure I tested qemu 2.8 against an old disk image from 2012 and it boots fine w/o any  complaints during the device probes.
