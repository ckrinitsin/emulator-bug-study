Mac OS X cannot passthrough USB device to guest

I'm using Mac OS 10.9.4 with qemu-system-arm installed from brew (version 1.7.1) and verified with qemu-system-x86_64. I'm trying to pass a Ralink 5370 WiFi USB dongle to my guest system, it appears in my system profiler as:

802.11 n WLAN:

  Product ID:	0x5370
  Vendor ID:	0x148f
  Version:	 1.01
  Serial Number:	1.0
  Speed:	Up to 480 Mb/sec
  Manufacturer:	Ralink
  Location ID:	0x1d110000 / 6
  Current Available (mA):	500
  Current Required (mA):	450

Using the docs, I'm passing "-usb -device usb-host,vendorid=0x148f,productid=0x5370" and getting this error back:
"qemu-system-arm: -device usb-host,vendorid=0x148f,productid=0x5370: Parameter 'driver' expects device type"

I don't imagine anybody's tested trying to get USB passthrough to
work on Macs. If it works it will be by happy side effect of the code
written for and tested on Linux happening to work.

It may not help, but it would be useful to try against a newer version
of QEMU, ie 2.1. You'll need to make sure you have the libusb
dev libraries installed so our configure can find them.

I'll give it a shot, thanks :)

For future googlers, I first ran "brew uninstall qemu" then "brew install libusb".

After that, download the source, "./configure", "make", "sudo make install" and you're done.

Comment #3 sounds like this bug has been fixed, right? So I'm closing this bug ticket now.
