The virglrenderer depency causes qemu native recipe building to fail for NXP QEMU
Description of problem:
nativesdk-qemu-8.2.2.imx-r0 do_compile: oe_runmake failed
...
 [87/4472] Compiling C object libcommon.fa.p/hw_display_virtio-gpu.c.o

This issue was originally exposed after updating Yocto release to Scarthgap

https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/topic/building_sdk_fails_after/109275322

which seems to relate to commit https://github.com/nxp-imx/imx-qemu/commit/628105edbd816458dbf154a128cc3dd3ac809c7e that seemingly induces dependency to virglrenderer.h for virtio_gpu driver.

Enabling opengl in our Distribution features is not a solution because that pulls in VGA graphics dependencies to our target binaries and we have no graphics hardware on our system. I have tried to disable the virglrenderer through QEMU build configuration but that does not fix the issue.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Clone NXP BSP Scarthgap
```
$ mkdir nxp-bsp
$ cd nxp-bsp
nxp-bsp$ repo init -u https://github.com/nxp-imx/imx-manifest -b scarthgap -m imx-6.6.36-2.1.0.xml
nxp-bsp$ repo sync
```

2. Remove opengl from `fsl-imx-xwayland` DISTRO_FEATURES

```
sources/meta-imx/meta-imx-sdk/conf/distro/fsl-imx-wayland.conf:
...
+DISTRO_FEATURES:remove = "opengl "
...
```

3. Build qemu-native_8.2.2.imx

```
$ bitbake qemu-native_8.2.2.imx
```
