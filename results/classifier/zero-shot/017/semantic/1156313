X86-64 flags handling broken

The current qemu sources cause improper handling of flags on x86-64.
This bug seems to have shown up a few weeks ago.

A plain install of Debian GNU/Linux makes user processes catch
spurious signals.  The kernel seems to run stably, though.

The ADX feature works very poorly.  It might be related; at least it
allows for reproducibly provoking invalid behaviour.

Here is a test case:

================================================================
qemumain.c
#include <stdio.h>
long adx();
int
main ()
{
  printf ("%lx\n", adx (0xffbeef, 17));
  return 0;
}
================================================================
qemuadx.s:
        .globl  adx
adx:    xor     %rax, %rax
1:      dec     %rdi
        jnz     1b
        .byte 0xf3, 0x48, 0x0f, 0x38, 0xf6, 0xc0        # adox  %rax, %rax
        .byte 0x66, 0x48, 0x0f, 0x38, 0xf6, 0xc0        # adcx  %rax, %rax
        ret
================================================================

Compile and execute:
$ gcc -m64 qemumain.c qemuadx.s
$ a.out
ffffff8000378cd8

Expected output is simply "0".  The garbage value varies between qemu
compiles and guest systems.

Note that one needs a recent GNU assembler in order to handle adox and
adcx.  For convenience I have supplied them as byte sequences.

Exaplanation and feeble analysis:

The 0xffbeef argument is a loop count.  It is necessary to loop for a
while in order to trigger this bug.  If the loop count is decreased,
the bug will seen intermittently; the lower the count, the less
frequent the invalid behaviour.

It seems like a reasonable assumption that this bug is related to
flags handling at context switch.  Presumably, qemu keeps flags state
in some internal format, then recomputes then when needing to form the
eflags register, as needed for example for context switching.

I haven't tried to reproduce this bug using qemu-x86_64 and SYSROOT,
but I strongly suspect that to be impossible.  I use
qemu-system-x86_64 and the guest Debian GNU/Linux x86_64 (version
6.0.6) .

The bug happens also with the guest FreeBSD x86_64 version 9.1.  (The
iteration count for triggering the problem 50% of the runs is not the
same when using the kernel Linux and FreeBSD's kernel, presumably due
to different ticks.)

The bug happens much more frequently for a loaded system; in fact, the
loop count can be radically decreased if two instances of the trigger
program are run in parallel.

Thanks.  I can confirm that this fixes the bug triggered by my test case
(and yours).  However, the instability of Debian GNU/Linux x86_64 has
not improved.

The exact same Debian version (debian "testing") updated at the same
time runs well on hardware.

My qemu Debian system now got messed up, since I attempted an upgrade in
the buggy qemu, which segfaulted several times during the upgrade.  I
need to reinstall, and then rely on -snapshot.

There is a problem with denorms which is reproducible, but whether that
is a qemu bug, and whether it can actually cause the observed
instability, is questionable.  Here is a testcase for that problem:




It should terminate.  The observed buggy behaviour is that it hangs.

The instability problem can be observed at gmplib.org/devel/tm-date.html.
hwl-deb.gmplib.org is Debian under qemu with -cpu Haswell,+adx.

Not that the exact same qemu runs FreeBSD flawlessly (hwl.gmplib.org).
It is neither instable nor does it run the denorms testcase poorly.

I fully realise this is a hopeless bug report, but I am sure you can
reproduce it, since it is far from GMP specific.  After all apt-get
update; apt-get upgrade triggered it.  Debugging it will be a nightmare.

Qemu version: main git repo from less than a week ago + Richard ADX
patch.

It looks from this bug that we fixed the initial ADOX bug in commit c53de1a2896cc (2013), and I've just tried the 'qemu-denorm-problem.s' test case from comment #1 and it works OK, so I think we've fixed that denormals bug too. Given that, and that this bug report is 4 years old, I'm going to close it. If you're still having problems with recent versions of QEMU, please open a new bug.
