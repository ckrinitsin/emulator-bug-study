Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is having trouble enabling KVM in QEMU for the RISC-V 64-bit architecture. They followed the usual steps: cloning the repo and running `./configure` with `--target-list=riscv64-softmmu --enable-kvm`. But when they check, KVM support isn't enabled, and the log says it's NO.

First, I need to understand what each category means. The options are mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user is specifically mentioning `--enable-kvm` not working for `qemu-system-riscv64`. So the issue is related to KVM support in QEMU's RISC-V target. 

I know that enabling KVM requires certain configurations and sometimes specific host support. Maybe the problem is that the RISC-V softmmu target doesn't properly detect or enable KVM, despite the configure flag. This could be due to missing code in the target's setup or dependencies not being met.

Looking at the categories, 'KVM' seems like the obvious choice because the bug directly relates to KVM functionality. The user is trying to enable it but isn't succeeding, so the issue falls under the KVM category.
