Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "MigrationCapability 'dirty-bitmaps off'". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the mention of "Migration" suggests it's related to live migration in QEMU/KVM. Dirty bitmaps are used during migration to track changes in memory so they can be efficiently transferred. The term "off" indicates that this feature is disabled or not working as expected.

Looking at the categories, "KVM" is a strong candidate since dirty bitmaps are part of KVM's live migration process. It's not about mistranslation or assembly issues. Other options like network could be related, but the direct mention of MigrationCapability points to KVM's specific feature.
