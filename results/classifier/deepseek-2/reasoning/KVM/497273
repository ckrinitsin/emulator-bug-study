Okay, let's see. The user is reporting a bug with QEMU where Windows XP 64 fails to install when using KVM in version rc2. They provided detailed information about the host setup, including Fedora 11 and specific KVM modules. 

The steps they took involve building QEMU from a particular commit and running it with certain parameters. The guest OS hangs during installation after reverting a specific commit related to cpuid and multicore setup on Intel CPUs. When they revert that commit, the problem goes away.

Looking at the categories provided, I need to classify this bug. It's happening in QEMU with KVM involved, so "KVM" is definitely relevant. The issue arises after a specific code change, suggesting it's related to how QEMU handles certain CPU features or virtualization specifics. 

The other possible categories like network, graphic, etc., don't seem to fit here since the problem isn't about networking or graphics but rather installation failure with KVM involved. So the primary category should be "KVM."
