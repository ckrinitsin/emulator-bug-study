Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into one of the given categories. The user provided possible categories like mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The bug report is titled "Errors when install QEMU from source code." Hmm, installation errors usually relate to build issues or setup problems. The categories given don't directly mention 'installation' as a specific category. Let me think about what might be related.

Looking at the possible options: 'files' could relate to file handling during installation, but that's not specific. 'permissions' might come into play if there are permission issues when installing files, but again, that's only part of it. 'other' is a catch-all category for issues that don't fit elsewhere.

Since the error occurs during installation from source code, which typically involves compiling and setting up dependencies, this doesn't directly fall under any specific category like network or graphic issues. It might be related to build processes but none of the categories except 'other' seem appropriate here.

So I think the best fit is 'other' because it's a general issue not covered by the more specific categories provided.
