Alright, so I need to classify this bug report: "Impossible to cross compile from Ubuntu or Debian to Windows with the tutorial". The possible categories are listed, and I have to choose just one word as the category.

First, let me understand what the bug is about. The user is saying that they can't cross-compile using the provided tutorial when going from Ubuntu/Debian (which are Linux distributions) to Windows. Cross-compiling typically involves building software on one platform for another, often requiring specific toolchains and configurations.

Looking at the categories:

1. **mistranslation**: This relates to incorrect semantic mapping in user-mode assembly, which doesn't seem directly related here.
2. **assembly**: Assembly lowering issues, not relevant as cross-compiling isn't just about assembly.
3. **other**: A catch-all category if none fit.
4. **device**: Hardware devices, probably not the issue.
5. **graphic**: Graphics-related bugs, unlikely.
6. **socket**: Networking at a low level; perhaps related to network compilation? Not sure.
7. **network**: Could be about networking issues, but again, cross-compiling might not relate directly unless it's part of the build process over the network.
8. **KVM**: Kernel-based Virtual Machine, hypervisor-related. Cross-compiling for a VM setup could involve this, but I'm not sure.
9. **boot**: Booting issues, probably not relevant here.
10. **vnc**: Remote desktop, unrelated.
11. **debug**: Debugging tools, unlikely.
12. **files**: Filesystem issues during compilation? Maybe, but cross-compiling is more about toolchains.
13. **permissions**: Access rights might affect compilation, but the issue is with the process itself not permissions.
14. **performance**: Compilation speed isn't mentioned as a problem.
15. **kernel**: Kernel-level issues; maybe if compiling for the kernel, but cross-compiling to Windows would be user-space.
16. **peripherals**: Hardware devices again, probably not.
17. **hypervisor**: Similar to KVM, perhaps not directly relevant unless it's about virtualization.

The bug report mentions using a tutorial, which suggests that the issue is with following specific instructions for setting up cross-compilation. Since none of the other categories seem to fit well, and considering that cross-compiling often involves toolchains and build environments which don't fall neatly into the given categories, "other" seems like the most appropriate classification.

The bug report discusses an issue with cross-compiling using a tutorial, which doesn't fit into the more specific categories provided. Therefore, it falls under the general category of other issues.

**Answer: other**
