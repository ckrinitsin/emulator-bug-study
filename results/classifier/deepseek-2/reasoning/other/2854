Okay, so I need to classify the given bug report into one of the provided categories. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The user is pointing out that the main page of qemu.org doesn't provide a clear starting guide or link for new users. They tried clicking on "Full-system emulation" expecting it to lead them to some basic documentation but found it wasn't straightforward. The steps they took led them to various nested links, which is confusing.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue here isn't about any of those technical areas. It's more about how information is presented on the website and the lack of a clear entry point for new users. The problem lies with the documentation structure and user experience rather than any code or feature malfunction.

I don't think it fits into 'mistranslation' because that refers to incorrect mapping in code, not documentation. It's not an assembly issue either. The other categories like device, graphic, etc., are all about specific functionalities which aren't the focus here.

So, the appropriate category seems to be 'other' since it's a general user interface and documentation problem.
