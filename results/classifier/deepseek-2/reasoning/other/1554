Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is asking about running qemu-img on any Linux OS and mentions that it depends on many dynamic libraries, causing issues when those aren't supported elsewhere. They suggest using static compilation as a solution.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about dynamic libraries and static compilation of qemu-img. Static compilation isn't a part of the target architecture or translation layers; it's more about how the software is built. The user refers to an existing issue (#1190), which might be related to build options or dependencies. This doesn't fit into any specific category like network, KVM, or graphic issues.

So, since static compilation isn't directly tied to a specific feature but rather to the build process and dependency management, it falls under 'other'.
