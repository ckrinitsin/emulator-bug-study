Alright, I need to classify this bug report based on the provided categories. The user has given me a list of possible categories, and I have to determine which one fits best.

The bug report mentions "tests/acceptance: Allow to overwrite smp and memory values set by `avocado_qemu.LinuxTest`." Additionally, there's a reference link discussing this topic. 

Looking at the categories, I see options like 'mistranslation', 'assembly', 'other', etc. The main issue here seems related to testing and configuration in QEMU, specifically allowing users to overwrite certain settings during tests. This doesn't fall under any of the specific technical areas like 'network' or 'graphic'; it's more about how tests are set up.

The discussion link likely pertains to modifying test parameters without affecting other configurations, which is a testing setup issue rather than a bug in code translation or performance. Therefore, the most appropriate category here is 'other' since it doesn't neatly fit into any of the predefined technical categories but relates to test configuration.
