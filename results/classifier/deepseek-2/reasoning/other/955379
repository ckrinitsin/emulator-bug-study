Okay, I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user reports that CMake hangs when using qemu-arm-static. They're compiling in a chroot with specific configurations and encountering the issue consistently during different points of CMake execution, particularly when searching for libraries like Eigen3 or Boost.

Looking at the possible categories:

- It's not related to assembly lowering or mistranslation because the issue occurs in user-mode and isn't about mapping from source to IR/target.
- It doesn't mention any specific areas like network, socket, or graphic issues.
- The problem is with CMake hanging during library searches. This could be due to issues with how QEMU handles file operations or permissions, but I'm not certain.
- Another angle: when using qemu-arm-static, it's running a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit system. Maybe there's an issue with the static compilation affecting CMake's execution environment, possibly related to permissions or how the chroot is handling file access.

Wait, the user mentioned they're in a chroot environment and using --static. The hanging could be due to issues with how QEMU handles static binaries or the way it interacts with the filesystem, especially when looking for libraries. Since CMake is freezing during library searches, perhaps there's an issue with how paths are being handled by QEMU.

Alternatively, maybe the problem lies in how the chroot environment interacts with QEMU's file handling. This could relate to files or permissions but might not fit exactly into those categories.

Another thought: since it's about CMake hanging when using a static qemu-arm-static build, perhaps it's related to the way QEMU emulates system calls or handles process execution in user-mode, which might fall under 'other' if none of the specific categories apply.

The issue is related to CMake hanging during library searches while using qemu-arm-static. This doesn't fit into the more specific categories like network or file permissions but seems to be a general problem with how QEMU interacts with the build environment, possibly due to static compilation issues.
