Alright, I need to classify this bug report from QEMU. Let's see what the issue is.

The user mentions that the configure script uses non-POSIX bash syntax, specifically "==" in an if condition. They provided a line from the code: `if test "$have_keyring" == "yes"`. The problem occurs because dash (a POSIX-compliant shell) doesn't accept double equals here. This causes an error when running configure on systems using dash as /bin/sh.

The user also notes that this issue was introduced recently and is a minor problem since the rest of the script completes fine but with some test failing.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is in the configure script's syntax. Configure isn't part of any specific component like networking or graphics; it's a build configuration tool. The issue relates to shell scripting practices, which doesn't fit into categories like device or network.

The problem isn't about assembly translation (mistranslation), nor does it relate directly to user-mode issues. It's more about the build system's script compliance with POSIX standards. Since this falls outside the listed specific areas but impacts the build process, the most appropriate category is 'other'.
