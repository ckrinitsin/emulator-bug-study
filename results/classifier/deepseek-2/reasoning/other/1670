Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user is having trouble statically building x86_64-softmmu on macOS using Darwin (Intel). They mentioned they're using Podman which relies on QEMU and that their team dynamically compiles it. Now they want static compilation for both amd64 and arm64 targets.

The main issue seems to be about static compilation, particularly whether softmmu supports it on macOS. From what I know, static compilation involves building an executable without shared libraries, which can sometimes cause issues with certain tools or environments.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The problem isn't related to translation between architectures (mistranslation) because it's about static build on macOS, not about how source maps to target. It's also not about assembly lowering (assembly). 

Static compilation issues might fall under 'other' if they don't fit into the more specific categories. Alternatively, maybe it's a kernel issue since macOS uses a different system than Linux for certain things. But I'm not sure if static builds failing on macOS would be directly related to the kernel.

Wait, softmmu is part of QEMU and deals with machine emulation. If they can't build statically, perhaps this relates more to how the build process works on Darwin (macOS), which might involve issues with libraries or dependencies that aren't being properly handled during static compilation. Since it's about the build process rather than runtime behavior, 'other' seems appropriate because it doesn't fit into any of the specific categories like network, KVM, etc.

Alternatively, considering the target is x86_64-softmmu, maybe it's a device or peripherals issue, but I don't think so. The problem isn't about devices not working; it's about compiling without dynamic libraries.

So after considering, 'other' seems like the best fit because it's a general build issue that doesn't fall under any specific category listed.
