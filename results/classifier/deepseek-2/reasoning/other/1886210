Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user provided a list of possible categories like mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the bug report, it's actually a feature request asking for an Illumos VM image to be added. The user mentions they have existing VMs for building QEMU and suggests adding an Illumos one to aid in testing and prevent regressions. It was suggested by Thomas Huth.

Now, none of the categories directly relate to adding a new VM image or supporting a particular OS as a target. Categories like KVM, hypervisor, or other could be considered, but 'other' is a catch-all for things that don't fit elsewhere. Since this isn't about performance, security, debugging, or device-related issues, it's more of a feature enhancement rather than fixing a bug.

Therefore, the most appropriate category here would likely be 'other', as it doesn't fall under any specific technical area listed.
