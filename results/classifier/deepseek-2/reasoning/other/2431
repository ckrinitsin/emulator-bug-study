Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report says that QEMU ships a single qemu.1 manpage intended for all system emulators, but it's filled with specific info and commands related to qemu-system-x86_64. 

Looking at the categories, 'other' is a catch-all for issues that don't fit into other specific areas. This issue isn't about translation errors, assembly, or any of the listed technical components like network or devices. It's more about documentation inaccuracies affecting all emulators, not just one component.

So, the appropriate category here is 'other'.

The bug report discusses an issue with the QEMU manpage being specific to a particular emulator (qemu-system-x86_64) instead of providing general information applicable to all system emulators. This is related to documentation and user experience rather than any technical component or feature, making it fit under 'other'.

**Answer:** other
