Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The report mentions QEMU version 1.5.0 having an error when saving a VM using ceph-rbd as the storage backend. The error is -95, which the user thinks might be "Operation not supported."

Looking at the possible categories: Mistranslation relates to semantic mapping issues in user-mode, which doesn't seem relevant here. Assembly lowering is about generating incorrect assembly code, which also isn't the case.

The bug is related to saving a VM with ceph-rbd, so it's likely storage-related. Among the options, 'storage' or 'files' might fit, but none of those are listed as categories. Wait, checking the list: I see 'files' and 'permissions,' but more relevantly, perhaps 'other.'

Alternatively, the bug could be related to how QEMU interacts with the backend storage, possibly under 'hypervisor' since it's part of the virtualization process, or maybe 'device' if it's a block device issue.

But looking back, the categories provided don't have 'storage.' The closest might be 'files,' but that doesn't fit exactly. Maybe 'other' is the safest bet as it doesn't clearly fall into any other category.

The bug report is about an error when saving a VM using ceph-rbd storage, which isn't directly covered by the listed categories except possibly 'hypervisor.' However, considering the context, the most fitting category might be:
