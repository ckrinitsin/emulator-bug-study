Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through it carefully.

The issue is about the x86 q35 machine type in QEMU not having proper documentation. The user points out that the documentation was added for another part (the commit) but not updated in the main docs file. They also mention there was some development documentation on the wiki, but perhaps it's insufficient or outdated.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and others. 

This bug isn't related to any of the technical aspects like translation errors or performance issues. It's about missing documentation, which falls under "other" since it doesn't fit into the specific categories listed but is still an important oversight that needs addressing.

The issue pertains to missing documentation for a machine type in QEMU. Since it's not related to any specific technical category like device or network but rather a lack of documentation, it fits best under "other."
