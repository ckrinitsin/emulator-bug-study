Alright, I'm looking at this bug report about the QEMU documentation mentioning non-existent "runtime" downloads. The user is pointing out that the official docs refer to binary blobs that aren't available anymore on QEMU.org. Specifically, they mention files like qemu-XXX-i386-wine.tar.gz and qemu-runtime-i386-XXX-.tar.gz, which are no longer provided.

The report suggests that these references should be updated or removed to avoid confusion, possibly adding instructions for building components instead. There's also a mention of other outdated "tar.gz" file references in the documentation, some dating back over a decade.

I need to categorize this bug into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the issue, it's about incorrect documentation references. The problem isn't related to any specific QEMU component like networking or virtualization. It's more about outdated and misleading information in the user-space emulator docs. 

The category "other" seems appropriate here because it doesn't fit into any of the other specific areas listed. It's a documentation issue rather than a bug in code functionality.
