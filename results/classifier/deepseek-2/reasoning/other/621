Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "make after configure not working" in QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me think about each possible category and see which one fits best.

First, the categories provided are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report mentions "make after configure not working." So, it's about the build process failing after configuration. I know that when you run 'configure' in QEMU, it sets up the build environment, and then you typically run 'make' to compile everything. If make isn't working after configure, this is likely related to the build system or the compilation process.

Looking at the categories, none of them directly mention build issues like make failing. Mistranslation refers to incorrect semantic mapping in code translation, which doesn't fit here. Assembly lowering is about converting high-level code to assembly, not about the build process itself. Device, graphic, etc., are related to hardware emulation or features.

The 'other' category is a catch-all for issues that don't fit into other specific categories. Since this bug is about the build process failing after configure, which isn't covered by any of the more specific categories like network or kernel, it seems appropriate to classify it under 'other.'
