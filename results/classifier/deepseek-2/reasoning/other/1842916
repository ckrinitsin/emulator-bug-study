Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the bug report title: "Enhanced Hardware Support - Finalize Naming". It sounds like a feature request rather than a bug. The content mentions finalizing naming for the next machine, which relates to hardware support and possibly device configuration.

The categories provided don't have a direct 'feature request' category. However, under 'other', it might fit since it's not a specific technical issue but more about naming conventions or features. Alternatively, 'device' could be considered if it's related to hardware devices, but the report seems more about the machine's configuration name rather than device drivers.

I think 'other' is the most appropriate category here because it doesn't fit neatly into any of the others provided.
