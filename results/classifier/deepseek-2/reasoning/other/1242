Okay, I need to classify this bug report where the user says they're unable to build QEMU on macOS. Let's see the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about building QEMU, which relates to compilation and build process. Looking at the categories, none of them directly mention build or compilation issues. The closest might be 'other' since it's a general problem not fitting into specific hardware-related areas. So I'll go with 'other'.

The bug report mentions an issue with building QEMU on macOS, which relates to the build process and is not specifically tied to any of the listed categories like device or network issues. Therefore, it falls under the most appropriate category.
