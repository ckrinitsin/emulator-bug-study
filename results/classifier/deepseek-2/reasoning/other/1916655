Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's start by reading the problem carefully.

The user reports that compiling QEMU fails because of zstd qcow2 compression issues. They provided commands they used to compile and some error messages from configure and make outputs.

Looking at the errors in the build output, it seems like there are two main issues: an implicit declaration of a function 'ZSTD_compressStream2' and an undeclared enum 'ZSTD_e_end'. 

I know that zstd is a compression library used by QEMU for qcow2 image support. The error messages indicate that the code is trying to use functions or enums from zstd but isn't finding them properly, leading to compilation failures.

Now, looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The problem here is related to the zstd library, which is used for compression in block devices, specifically qcow2 images. The bug isn't about incorrect semantic mapping (mistranslation) or assembly code issues. It's more about how QEMU interacts with the zstd library during compilation.

Since the errors are about function declarations and enums not being recognized, it suggests that either the version of zstd is too new for QEMU to handle or there's a missing header inclusion. The user mentioned using zstd 1.4.8, which is relatively recent. Maybe QEMU hasn't been updated to support newer zstd functions yet.

The category 'other' seems appropriate because this issue doesn't fit into the more specific categories like network, device, or kernel. It's a build-time error related to library compatibility and function declarations, which falls under general compilation issues.
