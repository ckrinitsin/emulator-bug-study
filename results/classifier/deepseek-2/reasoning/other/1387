Alright, let's tackle this classification task. So, the user provided a bug report related to QEMU and wants it categorized into one of several predefined categories. The possible categories are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the bug report, the user is asking to add information to QEMU's FAQ about compiling Windows x86/x64 installers under Linux Ubuntu. The link provided goes to a section on Debian-based cross builds for W32. So, this seems related to building or compiling something in QEMU, but not directly pointing to any of the specific technical categories like network, device, etc.

I need to figure out which category fits best. Since it's about adding documentation on how to compile something, it doesn't fall under mistranslation, assembly, or performance issues. It's more about providing instructions, so "other" might be the right choice because it's not a technical bug but rather a request for documentation enhancement.
