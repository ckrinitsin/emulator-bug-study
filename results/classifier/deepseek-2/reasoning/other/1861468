Okay, so I'm looking at this bug report where someone is trying to build QEMU statically on an Android platform using a proot container. They mentioned that they successfully built other libraries like libSDL2 and libiSCSI, which were detected by the configure script. But when they tried to run `./configure` with the `--static` option, it failed because SDL wasn't found. So they had to disable SDL, but then during linking, other missing libraries like -lgtk3 and -ldrm showed up.

Hmm, the user is encountering issues specifically when trying to build QEMU statically. They mentioned that without static linking, everything worked fine. The problem seems to be related to dependencies not being properly linked or available when building in a static manner. This might involve missing development libraries or incorrect flags during the build process.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation relates to semantic mapping issues, which doesn't seem relevant here since this is about linking and dependencies. Assembly lowering isn't applicable either. Other categories like device, graphic (which SDL falls under), socket, network, etc., might be related, but the main issue is with static linking and missing libraries during the build.

The problem arises when trying to link the executables because the linker can't find certain libraries. This suggests that even though the user built necessary libraries, perhaps they weren't included in the static build or their paths weren't correctly set. Since this is a build process issue, it's more about how dependencies are handled during compilation rather than runtime issues.

The main keywords here are "statically", "build", and "libraries missing". This points towards an issue with the build configuration or missing development packages required for static linking. It might not be directly related to any specific component like graphics or network but is a broader build-time problem.

Therefore, the category that best fits this bug report is likely 'other' because it doesn't neatly fall into the more specific categories provided and seems to be a general issue with building QEMU statically on their setup.
