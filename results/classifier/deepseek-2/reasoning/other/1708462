Alright, I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user mentioned that currently, the configure script requires Python 2, which is nearing its end of life (EOL). They want QEMU to support building with Python 3 instead.

First, I need to look at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and other. 

The issue is about build configuration. The problem isn't with the actual code translation from source to target or any of the listed categories like devices or graphics. It's specifically about using Python 3 for building, which relates to the build process itself.

I don't see a category that directly addresses build system issues. The closest might be 'other' since it's not fitting into the predefined specific categories. Alternatively, maybe 'files' could be considered if it's related to how scripts are handled, but that seems a stretch.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'other', as it doesn't fall under any of the more specific technical areas listed.

The bug report discusses the need for QEMU to support Python 3 during its build process. Since this issue pertains to the build configuration and isn't related to any specific categories like device or network, it falls under the general category.
