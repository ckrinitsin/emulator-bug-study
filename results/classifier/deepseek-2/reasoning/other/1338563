Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the bug report again.

The user is pointing out that the README file in QEMU refers to "qemu-doc.html" and a URL, but these don't exist. Instead, there's only "qemu-doc.texi". 

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

This issue is about a file that doesn't exist as mentioned in the README. It's related to documentation and file existence, not any of the technical categories like assembly or network. The problem isn't with code translation, performance, or user permissions but rather with incorrect references in the documentation files.

So, the appropriate category would be 'other' because it doesn't fit into the more specific ones like device or kernel. It's more about the setup and documentation.

The issue is related to incorrect file references in the documentation, which doesn't fall under any of the specified technical categories but rather a general problem with the distribution's files.

**other**
