Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through it carefully.

The user is reporting that when they boot Redox OS GUI on ARM using QEMU, the system hangs with 100% CPU usage. They mention that using the CLI works fine but the GUI causes this issue. They suspect it might be related to mouse detection and handling. Also, the same image runs smoothly on x86.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and other.

The issue is about the GUI causing high CPU usage. Since it's related to the graphical interface, "graphic" seems like a likely category. The mention of mouse detection adds more context about input handling, which falls under graphics or display functions. 

It doesn't seem to be a translation issue (mistranslation), nor does it point to assembly issues or performance per se, though high CPU is a symptom. However, the root cause is likely in the graphical subsystem's interaction with the mouse or hardware.

So, I think "graphic" is the appropriate category here.

The bug report describes an issue where the GUI of Redox OS on ARM causes 100% CPU usage. The problem occurs when using QEMU and specifically affects the graphical interface. Since it's related to the graphical interface and possibly input handling (mouse detection), the most fitting category is "graphic".
