Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The bug report says: "Mouse cursor sometimes can't pass the invisible border on the right side of the screen." Let me break this down. The issue is about the mouse cursor not moving past a certain point on the screen, specifically on the right side. That sounds like it's related to how the graphical interface handles the mouse input.

Now, looking at the categories: graphic seems relevant because it involves display issues. But I should also consider other possibilities. Is this related to device drivers? Well, maybe, but the problem is more about the visual border rather than hardware interaction. Could it be a windowing system issue or how QEMU handles graphical output?

Another thought: QEMU has components like VNC for remote access and display handling. If the cursor movement is restricted, perhaps it's an issue with the graphical rendering or the way the virtual machine's screen is being handled. That points towards 'graphic' as a category.

I don't think it's related to network, socket, or kernel issues because those would affect connectivity or system calls, not mouse movement on the display. It's also not about permissions or files since there's no mention of access rights or file operations. Performance might be a stretch unless it's a lag issue causing the cursor to stop, but that's less likely.

Looking at peripherals, this could fit because mice are input devices, but the issue is more about graphical rendering rather than hardware device interaction. Hypervisor is related to VM management, which doesn't seem directly connected here.

So, considering all options, 'graphic' seems like the most appropriate category for this bug report.
