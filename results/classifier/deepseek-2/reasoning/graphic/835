Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is reporting an issue with SDL display not handling PS/2 relative packets correctly in QEMU. They mention that mouse events are always showing positive values, which seem more like absolute positions rather than relative ones.

Looking at the steps to reproduce, tracing input_event_rel shows that xrel and yrel are positive regardless of direction. The user also found that setting a specific SDL hint (SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_MODE_WARP) fixed the issue for them. This suggests that the problem lies in how the mouse events are being handled by the SDL library within QEMU.

The possible categories include things like device, graphic, network, etc. Since this is related to mouse input handling and display issues, it seems to fall under the 'graphic' category because it's about how the graphical interface (SDL) processes mouse events. The issue isn't with the kernel, hypervisor, or performance directly but rather with the graphical subsystem misreporting relative movements.

So, after considering all aspects, I think the correct classification is 'graphic'.
