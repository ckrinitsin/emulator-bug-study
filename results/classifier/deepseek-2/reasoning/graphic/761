Alright, I'm looking at this bug report about QEMU where the mouse cursor position isn't showing correctly when using the GTK display with OpenGL enabled. The user mentioned that the cursor is off by about 300x300 pixels, making it hard to use the mouse effectively in the guest OS.

First, I need to classify this issue into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem is related to the mouse cursor display in QEMU's graphical interface. Since it's using GTK and OpenGL, this points towards a graphics-related issue. The cursor position being incorrect suggests there might be an error in how the mouse events or coordinates are handled within the graphical display subsystem.

Looking at the categories, "graphic" seems like the most fitting because it directly relates to the visual output of the cursor on the screen. Other possibilities could include "peripherals," but that's more about hardware devices like USB or serial ports. Since this is specifically about the display and cursor positioning, "graphic" is more accurate.

I don't think it's related to assembly lowering or mistranslation because those are lower-level issues in code translation. It's not a network or socket problem either. So, "graphic" makes the most sense here.
