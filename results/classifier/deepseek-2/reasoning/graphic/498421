Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. The issue is about the emulated monitor EDID reporting too few graphics resolutions in a Windows guest. The user mentions that not many resolution modes are available because the virtual monitor's EDID doesn't provide enough options. They suggest adding more resolutions, like 1152x864, and even finer granularity for better customization.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem revolves around graphics resolutions in a virtual guest. The issue is with how QEMU emulates the monitor's EDID, which affects what resolutions are available to the guest OS. This seems related to the graphic output and display settings within the virtual machine. It's not about translation issues or assembly code; it's more about the device emulation, specifically the graphics hardware.

So, considering that, "graphic" seems like the most fitting category because the bug is about the availability of screen resolutions which relates directly to how the graphics are handled in QEMU.
