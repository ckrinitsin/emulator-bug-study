Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "vga/std lacks few wide screen modes." Let's see.

The user provided possible categories like device, graphic, etc. The bug is about VGA standards missing some widescreen modes. Since VGA relates to graphics hardware and display modes, it falls under the graphic category.
