Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user mentioned that when using virtio-gpu-gl in QEMU on an Apple Silicon M2 Pro, they're getting an "OpenGL is not available" message. They compiled QEMU with OpenGL and other necessary flags enabled.

First, I'll look at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, etc. The issue seems related to the graphics part because it's about OpenGL in a GPU device. Since virtio-gpu-gl is a GPU-related component, this points towards 'graphic' as the category.

The user successfully compiled QEMU with all required libraries and flags, so the problem isn't about missing dependencies or compilation errors. The error message suggests that OpenGL isn't available, but it's unclear how to fix it. This likely relates to the interaction between VirtIO devices and GPU rendering in QEMU.

Considering other categories: It's not a mistranslation because that pertains to source-to-target mapping. It's also not an assembly issue or performance problem. The device is listed correctly, so maybe it's more about how the graphics are handled rather than the device itself.

Therefore, 'graphic' seems the most appropriate category for this bug report.
