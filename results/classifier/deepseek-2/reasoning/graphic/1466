Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The issue reported is about the GTK mouse position being incorrect in a HiDPI environment. Let me break it down.

The user mentions that when using `usb-tablet` mode, the guest cursor isn't matching the host's cursor position because QEMU isn't dividing the scaling factor before sending to the guest. So, this affects how the mouse is displayed within the virtual machine.

Looking at the possible categories: graphic seems related since it involves display issues. Other options like network or kernel don't fit here. The problem is about visual positioning, so 'graphic' makes sense.

The bug report describes an issue with mouse cursor positioning in a graphical environment, specifically related to HiDPI scaling and how QEMU handles the cursor coordinates for the guest OS. This falls under the category of graphics-related issues within QEMU.

**Answer: graphic**
