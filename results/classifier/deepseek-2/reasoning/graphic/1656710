Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is asking about supporting a specific keyboard shortcut: Ctrl-Alt-+= to zoom in and Ctrl-Alt--= to zoom out with GTK3. They mention that unlike other programs which use Ctrl-Alt-=, QEMU currently requires using Shift with the equals sign for zooming. The suggestion is to allow Ctrl-Alt-= as an additional zoom-in hotkey.

Now, looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue here is about user interface shortcuts, specifically related to zooming. Since this affects the graphical display of the emulator, it's likely under the 'graphic' category. The problem isn't with translation or assembly; it's more about how the application handles user input for graphical adjustments.

I don't think it fits into other categories like device, network, or kernel because those are related to hardware or system-level issues. This is purely a UI interaction problem.
