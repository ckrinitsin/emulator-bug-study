Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "Crash in early_gtk_display_init() on macOS 14.6.1". The possible categories are given, and I have to choose one.

First, let me understand what the bug is about. The function name is early_gtk_display_init(), which suggests it's related to initializing a display using GTK (a graphical toolkit). Since the crash occurs on macOS version 14.6.1, this likely pertains to how QEMU handles graphical interfaces on macOS.

Looking at the categories provided: graphic seems like the obvious choice because it involves display initialization with GTK. Other categories like network or KVM don't fit here since they're unrelated to graphics. The function is part of the display setup, so 'graphic' is the right category.

The bug report mentions a crash in `early_gtk_display_init()`, which is related to initializing the graphical display using GTK. Since this is about display initialization and involves a GUI toolkit (GTK), it falls under the category of graphics-related issues.
