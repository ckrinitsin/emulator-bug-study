Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. Let's read through the details carefully.

The user reports that when compiling QEMU with "--disable-gtk", creating a guest fails. They provided some environment details, including host and guest OS information, specific git commits from kvm.git and qemu.kvm, and kernel versions. The hardware is Ivytown_EP and Haswell_EP, which are Intel processors.

In the detailed description, they mention that compiling QEMU with either "--enable-gtk" or without "--disable-gtk" works fine for creating guests. But when both "--disable-sdl" and "--disable-gtk" are used during compilation, the guest creation fails. They also included steps to reproduce the issue and some logs showing a segmentation fault.

Looking at the error message: "qemu-system-x86_64: Invalid parameter 'to'" followed by a segfault. This suggests something went wrong in how QEMU is handling parameters or loading the configuration, possibly due to missing dependencies when certain UI components like GTK are disabled.

The categories provided include things like mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, network, hypervisor, etc. Since the issue arises when disabling GTK, which relates to graphical user interfaces, I'm leaning towards 'graphic' as the category.

Another possibility is that without GTK and SDL, QEMU might be missing some initialization steps required for proper operation, even though it's supposed to fall back to text-based interfaces or other default behaviors. The segfault indicates a crash, possibly due to an uninitialized variable or a missing library when GTK isn't available.

I don't see any mention of network-related issues, so 'network' might not be relevant here. Similarly, the bug doesn't seem related to device drivers or peripherals specifically, unless it's a deeper issue in how those components are initialized without GTK.

Therefore, considering that GTK is a graphical library and the problem occurs when it's disabled, the most appropriate category seems to be 'graphic'.
