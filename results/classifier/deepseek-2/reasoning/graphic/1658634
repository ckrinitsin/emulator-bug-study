Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report about QEMU into one of the given categories. The user mentioned they can't get a correct display when using the latest QEMU and OVMF BIOS with Ubuntu 16.04.1 Desktop 64-bit. They tried different configurations and found that it works with "-vga cirrus" plus the OVMF BIOS, but not with "-vga std". It also worked with non-UEFI BIOS and in QEMU versions prior to 2.8.0.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is related to display problems with QEMU's VGA configuration and UEFI BIOS. Since it works with Cirrus but not std, and only when using OVMF, this points towards a problem with the graphical output in the virtual machine. The fact that it worked before suggests it's a regression introduced in version 2.8.0.

The categories related to graphics would be "graphic". Other possibilities could be "device" or maybe "boot", but since the issue is specifically about display, "graphic" seems most appropriate.
