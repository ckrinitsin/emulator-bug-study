Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report. The problem is about the display being blurry when using a fractional scaling factor in the SDL display within QEMU. Let me break it down.

First, the user mentions they're using a Wayland compositor like Sway with a scale of 1.25. They launch an Ubuntu guest with SDL display and notice the blurriness. The additional info points to an issue on the SDL GitHub where someone suggested setting `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI` which partially fixed it but caused scaling issues.

I need to categorize this bug into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about the display qualityâ€”blurry when scaling. This relates to how graphics are rendered. SDL is involved in handling the display and windowing system. The problem seems specific to the graphical output rather than other components like network or permissions.

Looking at the categories, "graphic" would be the most fitting since it's directly related to the visual rendering and display issues. There's no mention of performance bottlenecks or kernel-level issues; it's purely about how the graphics are being displayed.

The bug is related to the graphical output quality when using fractional scaling in SDL within QEMU. The issue arises due to improper handling of high DPI settings, leading to a blurry display. This directly impacts the visual rendering capabilities of the system.
