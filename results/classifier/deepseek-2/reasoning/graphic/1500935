Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The user mentioned that when they move their mouse over the KVM/QEMU window, it raises to the top and obscures other windows. This behavior isn't seen in other applications.

First, looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. The issue is about window managementâ€”specifically how QEMU's window behaves when the mouse hovers over it.

The category "graphic" seems appropriate because it relates to the graphical interface behavior of QEMU. It doesn't fall under assembly or performance issues but rather how the window interacts with the desktop environment.

Other categories like KVM are more about virtualization, and this is a UI issue, so graphic fits better.
