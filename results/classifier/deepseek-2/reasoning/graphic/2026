Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem described is that when using Virtio-vga-gl and setting xres=1920 and yres=1080, the VM's resolution isn't being set correctly. Instead of using these values, it inherits the window's resolution. 

Looking at the categories, I should figure out which one this issue falls into. The bug is related to display or graphics settings in QEMU. Since Virtio-vga-gl is a VGA emulator with OpenGL acceleration, it's clearly tied to graphic hardware and display handling.

The options include 'graphic' as one of the categories. This seems like the most appropriate because the problem is about the VM not using the specified resolution and instead taking the window's resolution, which relates directly to how graphics are managed in the virtual machine.

Other possible categories could be 'device' since it involves hardware emulation (VGA), but 'graphic' is more specific to display settings. Therefore, I'll choose 'graphic' as the category.
