Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The user mentioned a regression where QEMU 4.1.0 with qxl and KMS only shows a resolution of 4x10. They're using Arch Linux as both host and guest, with specific kernel versions.

The issue occurs on systems with amdgpu and integrated ASPEED graphics. Downgrading to 4.0.0 works fine, so the problem is new in 4.1.0. The user observed that it starts when KMS (Kernel Mode Setting) kicks in, which affects display configuration.

Looking at the categories: The bug relates to graphical resolution issues after KMS activation. KMS is part of the graphics subsystem handling in QEMU, particularly related to VNC or display configuration. Since the problem occurs during the transition managed by KMS and affects the guest's display, it falls under 'graphic' category.

So, the category should be 'graphic'.

The bug report describes an issue with the graphical resolution after KMS (Kernel Mode Setting) activation in QEMU 4.1.0. Since this is related to the graphical output and display configuration, the appropriate category is:

**graphic**
