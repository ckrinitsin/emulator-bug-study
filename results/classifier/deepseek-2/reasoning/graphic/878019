Okay, so I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU. Let's read through the details carefully.

The user is reporting an issue with version 0.15.1 where starting QEMU results in a black screen and 100% CPU usage. They also mention that it can't be stopped with Ctrl+C, requiring them to use killall -9. Additionally, strace shows it's waiting on a futex forever.

First, let me understand the symptoms: black screen suggests maybe a graphical issue or something wrong during the initialization of the display. 100% CPU usage indicates that the program is stuck in a tight loop or waiting on some resource without releasing the CPU. The fact that it can't be killed with Ctrl+C implies that the process isn't handling signals properly, which might relate to threading issues (like using futexes for synchronization).

Looking at the build configuration, they enabled mixemu and certain audio drivers but disabled OpenGL. So maybe there's an issue with how QEMU is initializing graphics without proper OpenGL support or something related.

Now, considering the categories provided: the options are mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The black screen likely relates to a graphical issue. The 100% CPU and futex waiting might be related to threading or synchronization in the graphics handling. So the primary category would probably be 'graphic' since that's where the problem seems to manifestâ€”either during initialization of the display or while handling graphical output.

Alternatively, it could be related to the window system or how QEMU initializes its display. The 100% CPU might mean there's a deadlock in the graphics code, possibly due to issues with threading or resource management.

I don't think it's about the hypervisor because that's more about managing virtual machines at a low level, and this seems like a higher-level issue. Similarly, network or socket issues aren't mentioned. It doesn't seem to be a performance issue per se but rather a functional one causing high CPU usage.

So putting it together, the bug is primarily related to graphics, where QEMU isn't displaying anything (black screen) and is stuck in a loop due to some synchronization problem.
