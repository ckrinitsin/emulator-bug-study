Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

The user mentioned issues with QBASIC not working correctly when trying to use EGA or VGA functions. Specifically, they get an "Illegal Function Call" error when running certain programs. The problem seems related to graphics modesâ€”CGA works, but EGA and VGA do not. 

Looking at the categories, "graphic" directly relates to issues with graphical output, which fits this bug since it's about QBASIC failing to set up higher-resolution graphics modes. Other possible categories like device or peripherals are broader but don't specifically address the graphics aspect here.

Therefore, the appropriate category is likely "graphic."
