Okay, I need to classify this bug report according to the given categories. The request is about adding support for a specific resolution (1366x768) to the -vga std output in QEMU. 

First, I recall that QEMU has different components, including the graphical output handling through VGA emulation. Since the user mentioned using -vga std, which refers to standard VGA output, this falls under the graphics category.

Looking at the categories provided: graphic is one of them. Other possibilities like network or kernel don't fit here because the issue isn't about networking or system calls but rather display resolution support.

The additional information points to past issues and discussions on the qemu-user mailing list, which further supports that this is a graphics-related feature request. The user tried to make it a feature request but faced an issue with GitLab removing the label, but that doesn't change the category of the bug report itself.

So, the correct classification is 'graphic'.

The bug report pertains to adding support for a specific resolution in QEMU's VGA output, which falls under graphical capabilities.
