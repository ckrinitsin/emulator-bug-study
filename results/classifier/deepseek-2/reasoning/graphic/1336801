Alright, let's break down this bug report and figure out its category. The user is reporting an issue where a 12.04 Ubuntu guest server hangs on a 14.04 host when using Virt-manager. They created the VM with a template, installed LAMP+SSH without issues, but upon reboot, it hangs during fsck.

They tried changing disk drivers but it didn't fully resolve the issue. The fix was switching to a VGA display driver instead of the default one. So, the problem revolves around graphics configuration causing the hang.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is related to graphics since switching display drivers fixed it. Therefore, the category should be 'graphic'.
