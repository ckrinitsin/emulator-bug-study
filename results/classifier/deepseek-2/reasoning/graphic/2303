Okay, I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me look at the information provided.

The patch is labeled as a "HACK" to set static resolutions for the VM. It modifies two files: hw/display/virtio-gpu-base.c and ui/gtk.c. The changes involve setting display resolutions, which suggests it's related to how QEMU handles graphics or displays.

Looking at the possible categories, 'graphic' is one of them. This makes sense because modifying display settings like resolutions falls under graphical output handling. Other categories like 'network' or 'KVM' don't fit here since those relate to networking or hypervisor features, which aren't mentioned in the patch.

The changes include setting static resolutions for multiple displays, which implies they're adjusting how QEMU manages graphics outputs. The modifications are in display-related files, further indicating it's a graphical issue.

So, the most appropriate category is 'graphic'.
