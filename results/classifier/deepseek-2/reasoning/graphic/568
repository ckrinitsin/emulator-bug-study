Alright, let's try to classify this bug report. The issue is about the vgamem_mb option not working correctly when running Mac OS or Windows guests in QEMU. 

First, looking at the problem description, the user sets vgamem_mb=128 but the guest doesn't recognize this value. For Mac OS, the VRAM shows 3MB instead of 128, and for Windows XP, it's N/A in dxdiag.

I need to figure out which category this falls into from the given list: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem is related to video memory settings in the guest OS. The VGA device is being used with a specific option that isn't taking effect as expected. So this likely involves how the hardware (VGA) is emulated and how the guest interacts with it.

Looking at the categories, "graphic" seems relevant since it's about video memory which relates to graphics handling in QEMU. The other options like device or peripherals are possible too, but graphic is more specific here.

The issue pertains to the VGA device configuration not correctly reflecting the specified video memory in guest operating systems, affecting how they report VRAM. This relates directly to the graphical capabilities and settings within the virtual machine.
