Okay, so I need to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The report says "cocoa: Remove deprecated CVDisplayLinkCreateWithCGDisplay() calls." Hmm, let's break that down.

First, the mention of Cocoa suggests it's related to Apple's frameworks, likely macOS or iOS. The specific function being removed is CVDisplayLinkCreateWithCGDisplay(), which I recognize as part of the Core Video (CV) framework. This function was used for creating display links, probably in video processing or rendering contexts.

Since the report is about removing deprecated functions, it indicates that these calls are no longer supported or recommended. The task here is to classify this under one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at these options, "graphic" seems relevant because Core Video is related to video and display handling. Deprecated functions in this area likely pertain to graphical operations or display management.

I don't think it's a mistranslation issue because that's more about incorrect mapping between architectures. It doesn't seem to be about assembly lowering either. Other categories like network, socket, or KVM don't fit here. The mention of display links is definitely tied to graphics and display handling.
