Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user is reporting a bug related to QEMU on macOS. They're using an external monitor and running Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA in fullscreen mode on their MacBook Pro. When they start the emulator, a few things happen: the virtual desktop switches, a splash screen appears briefly, and then the emulator shows up correctly on the external monitor.

Hmm, so the main issue seems to be that the splash screen is causing the virtual desktop to switch because it's appearing on a different space. The user suggests that if the splash screen wasn't shown or was part of the same window as the emulator, this problem wouldn't occur.

Looking at the possible categories: 'mistranslation', 'assembly', etc. This doesn't seem related to code translation or assembly lowering. It's more about how QEMU interacts with the graphical environment on macOS. The splash screen is a UI element, so maybe it's part of the graphic category. Alternatively, it could be a window management issue, which might fall under peripherals or something else.

But since the problem revolves around the display and virtual desktops, 'graphic' seems like the most fitting category. It's about how QEMU handles the initial screen output and window positioning.
