Alright, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is that QEMU crashes when pressing Ctrl-Alt-U. From what I know, Ctrl-Alt-U in QEMU typically triggers a window resizing action, which relates to the graphical interface. The user mentioned that this happens regardless of the OS and even without an OS, so it's likely tied directly to QEMU's display handling.

Looking at the categories, 'graphic' seems the most fitting because it's related to the graphical interface's behavior when certain keys are pressed. Other possibilities could be 'other,' but since it's specifically about a key combination affecting the window, 'graphic' is more precise.

The bug involves QEMU crashing due to pressing a key combination that affects its graphical interface. The most appropriate category is:

**graphic**
