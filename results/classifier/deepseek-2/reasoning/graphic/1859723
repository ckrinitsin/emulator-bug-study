Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The title says "Qemu ungrabs before cursor reaches border." From what I know, when an application uses the cursor in a window or display, there's something called "grabbing" where the mouse is captured by the app until certain conditions are met, like moving the cursor to the edge of the window.

In this case, it seems that QEMU is releasing (ungrabs) the mouse before the cursor actually reaches the border. That would mean the user might experience issues with how the mouse behaves when moving around in the virtual machine's display. 

Looking at the possible categories: assembly lowering, graphic, other, etc. The issue is related to the cursor movement and mouse handling, which falls under graphical operations. So it's likely a problem with how QEMU handles the graphical interface.

I don't think it's related to networking or sockets because that's more about data transfer. It's not about performance or kernel issues either. Graphic seems to be the most fitting category here.
