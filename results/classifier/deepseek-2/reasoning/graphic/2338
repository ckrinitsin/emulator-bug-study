Alright, let's try to classify this bug report. The user is asking for a feature where theSDL frontend should implement the "grab-on-hover=on" CLI option. So, it's a feature request, not exactly a bug.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The frontend here refers to how the graphical interface is handled. Since SDL is involved, which is a library for creating GUIs and handling events, this falls under the graphics category.

Wait, but(SDL is part of the display system), so maybe it's more related to 'graphic'. Alternatively, sometimes frontends are considered part of the 'peripherals' since they handle input and output devices. But in this case, it's about a specific feature of the graphical interface's behavior when hovering over a window.

So, considering that it's about the graphical frontend's interaction with the mouse, I think 'graphic' is the most appropriate category here.
