Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. Let's see what the issue is.

The user mentioned that building QEMU 9.0.0 fails on MacOS 10.15.7 with a specific error message related to initializing 'NSEdgeInsets'. The error says it's trying to assign an incompatible type 'id' into a struct NSEdgeInsets.

Looking at the code snippet, the problematic line is in cocoa.m:542. It's using safeAreaInsets from the window's screen and assigning it directly to NSEdgeInsets. I know that in Objective-C, NSEdgeInsets can be obtained from view or window properties, but maybe there was a change in how it's accessed.

The error suggests a type mismatch because safeAreaInsets returns an object of type id, which isn't compatible with the struct expected by NSEdgeInsets. This might be due to incorrect casting or method usage.

I remember that sometimes when dealing with UI elements, especially on macOS, using deprecated methods or incorrect property accesses can cause issues. Maybe the code is assuming a certain return type and needs adjustment.

The category options include things like assembly, device, graphic, etc. Since this error is related to UI components (window, screen insets), it likely falls under 'graphic' as it's about rendering or display settings.
