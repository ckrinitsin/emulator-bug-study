Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU. The issue is that the man page is missing some suboptions for the "-display" option. Specifically, they mention that things like "grab_on_hover=on|off" and "gl=on|off" aren't documented in qemu-options.hx.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The "-display" option relates to how QEMU handles graphics and display. The suboptions mentioned (grab_on_hover and gl) are part of the graphical interface configuration. Since the man page is missing documentation for these, it's a problem with the documentation but more specifically within the graphics handling part.

So, the category should be "graphic" because it deals with display options which are related to the graphical output of QEMU.
