Okay, let's figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user mentioned issues with display resolution being fixed at 800x600 even after installing the latest VirtIO drivers and guest additions. They followed specific steps: installed QEMU/KVM, set up a VM, installed Windows 10, VirtIO-Drivers, guest-agent, and qxl-drivers. 

The problem is related to display settings not being adjustable beyond 800x600 despite using the correct drivers. The user also noted an error about digital signatures not being checked for QXL drivers, which might be causing issues with driver installation or functionality.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, etc. Since this issue is specifically about display resolution and involves VirtIO and QXL drivers which are related to graphics, "graphic" seems like the most fitting category.
