Okay, I'm trying to figure out why there's an issue with the steal time after reverting certain QEMU commits. Let me go through this step by step.

First, from what I understand, when using systemtap, it was noticed that during a migration, the steal time wasn't being reported correctly. The user reverted two specific commits related to the steal time MSR handling in KVM and x86.

Let's break down the problem:

1. After reverting commit 0e50357, which fixed the callback for the steal time MSR, and commit 917367a, which added save/restore functionality for the steal time MSR, the issue of an overflow in steal time after migration was resolved.

2. However, when these commits are reverted, steal time isn't reported at all post-migration. That makes sense because commit 917367aa was responsible for saving and restoring the steal time MSR during migration. Without it, the steal time data isn't saved, so naturally, it's not restored either.

So, what do these commits do?

- **Commit 0e50357**: This commit converted the callback pointer to a proper X86CPU type for the steal time MSR vmsd. It ensures that the right structure is used when handling the MSR callbacks.
  
- **Commit 917367a**: This added code to save and restore the steal time MSR during migration, ensuring it's correctly handled across instances.

By reverting these, the system no longer saves the steal time MSR during migration. That's why it isn't reported after migrationâ€”it wasn't saved in the first place. 

But when these commits weren't reverted (i.e., they were present), there was an overflow issue because the main thread was trying to set the MSRs again after the vCPUs had already been started, leading to inconsistent states.

So, the user observed that without these commits, steal time isn't reported, which is expected. But with them, there's an overflow during migration.

This suggests that while 917367a is necessary for saving and restoring steal time, it might be causing issues when combined with other changes or scenarios. Perhaps there's a race condition where the main thread and vCPUs are interacting in a way that causes the overflow.

To fix this, maybe the order of operations needs to be adjusted so that the MSRs are set correctly without conflict. Alternatively, ensuring that after migration, the steal time is properly initialized before any vCPU activity starts might help prevent the overflow.

In summary, reverting these commits stops the steal time from being reported, which is correct because they handle saving/restoring. The issue lies in how these operations are timed or handled during the migration process when those commits are present.

The problem arises due to changes introduced by specific QEMU commits that manage the handling of the steal time MSR during KVM migrations. Reverting these commits stops the steal time from being reported, as they are responsible for saving and restoring this data. However, their presence leads to an overflow issue when MSRs are set post-migration.

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The overflow occurs because after reverting certain commits, the steal time isn't saved or restored during migration. Without these changes, the system relies on correct initialization upon unpausing vCPUs, which might not happen due to a race condition.

2. **Possible Fixes**:
   - Adjust the order of operations during migration to ensure MSRs are set correctly after all vCPUs have started.
   - Review and modify how steal time is initialized post-migration to prevent overflow.

3. **Conclusion**: The issue likely stems from a race condition in how MSRs are managed between the main thread and vCPU threads. Adjusting the sequence or timing of MSR operations during migration should resolve the overflow issue while retaining the necessary functionality for steal time reporting.
