Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. I'm looking at these log entries and trying to understand the issues.

First, there are multiple errors about "End of file from monitor" happening around 00:20, 01:06, and 01:09. This makes me think that the QEMU monitor is disconnecting or sending unexpected EOFs, which might be due to some instability in the hypervisor or a problem with the virtual machine's state.

Then, I see warnings about AppArmorSetFDLabel not finding paths for descriptors like /proc/self/fd/25 and 26. I know that AppArmor is related to system security and file access control. If it can't find these descriptors, maybe there's a permissions issue or the process isn't running under the expected user. This could be causing problems with how files are being handled.

The main recurring warning is about not being able to restore from a managed state at /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save/instance-0000462a.save, suggesting the file might be corrupted. So if this save file is crucial for resuming a VM, and it's corrupted or inaccessible, that would definitely cause issues when trying to start the VM again.

Putting it all together, the most likely problems are:
1. The QEMU monitor is experiencing EOF errors, which could mean the underlying connection is dropping.
2. AppArmor is failing to set labels on certain file descriptors, possibly due to missing permissions or incorrect paths.
3. The save file is corrupted, preventing proper VM restoration.

I should check if the save file exists and isn't corrupted. Maybe try restoring it manually outside of libvirt to see if it works. Also, looking into why AppArmor is having trouble with those descriptors might reveal some user or permission issues. Finally, ensuring that QEMU is stable and connections to the monitor are maintained could help prevent these EOF errors.

Based on the provided log entries, there are a few key issues that need to be addressed:

1. **End of File from Monitor**: There are multiple instances where `qemuMonitorIO` reports an "End of file" error. This suggests that the connection between libvirt and the QEMU monitor is being closed unexpectedly or prematurely.

2. **AppArmor Issues**: The warnings about `AppArmorSetFDLabel` indicate that there are issues with setting file descriptor labels for certain descriptors (e.g., `/proc/self/fd/25`). These errors might be related to permissions or missing files/directories, and could potentially affect the proper functioning of libvirt processes.

3. **Failed Restore from Managed State**: The warnings about `qemuDomainObjStart` indicate that libvirt is unable to restore a domain's state from the file `/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save/instance-0000462a.save`. This could be due to a corrupted save file or permissions issues preventing libvirt from accessing this file.

### Steps to Address These Issues:

1. **Check QEMU Monitor Connection**:
   - Ensure that the QEMU monitor is running and that there are no network or socket-related issues causing the connection to drop.
   - Consider increasing the timeout settings for the QEMU monitor if it's closing connections prematurely.

2. **Investigate AppArmor Warnings**:
   - Verify that the necessary file descriptors exist and that the libvirt processes have the appropriate permissions to access them.
   - Check the AppArmor logs for more detailed information about these failures and adjust policies as needed.

3. **Check Save File Integrity**:
   - Ensure that the save file `/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save/instance-0000462a.save` exists and is not corrupted. You can try restoring this file manually outside of libvirt to see if it's usable.
   - If the file is corrupted, you may need to delete it and let libvirt recreate a new save file.

4. **Troubleshoot Domain Restore**:
   - After ensuring that the save file is intact, attempt to restore the domain using `virsh` or another tool to see if the issue persists.
   - If the problem continues, consider removing any existing managed states for the domain and letting libvirt recreate them.

5. **Check Permissions on Save Directory**:
   - Ensure that the directory `/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save/` has the correct permissions so that libvirt can read and write to it.

6. **Restart Services as a Last Resort**:
   - If none of the above steps resolve the issues, you may need to restart libvirt services or even reboot the host machine to see if the problems persist.

### Example Commands to Check Save File:

```bash
# Check if the save file exists and has readable permissions
ls -l /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save/instance-0000462a.save

# Attempt to restore the domain manually (use with caution)
virsh restore --file /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save/instance-0000462a.save <domain-name>
```

### Conclusion:

The main issues seem to be related to the QEMU monitor connection, AppArmor file descriptor problems, and a potential issue with the save file used for domain restoration. By addressing each of these areas step by step, you should be able to resolve the errors being reported in the logs.
