Okay, I'm trying to figure out why this crash happened. The user provided a backtrace and mentioned that the issue was first seen with commit 40dce4ee61c68395f6d463fae792f61b7c003bce by Paolo Bonzini, which fixes rerror/werror=ignore in scsi-disk.

Looking at the backtrace, it starts with an assertion failure in assert.c:92. The assertion is checking that req->status == -1. So somewhere in the code, this condition isn't met, causing the program to crash.

The function where the assertion fails is scsi_req_complete, which suggests that this function is being called when the SCSI request hasn't been properly set up or completed as expected.

Looking at the commit message, Paolo modified scsi-disk.c. The issue was that when rerror=ignore returned true, the callers weren't calling scsi_req_complete. So he fixed it by adding a call to scsi_req_complete in scsi_handle_rw_error.

Hmm, so before this fix, when an error occurred and rerror=ignore was set, the function wasn't completing the request properly, leading to potential issues later on. The assertion failure now is because somewhere in the code, after this change, the request's status isn't -1 as expected.

I think that the problem arises because scsi_req_complete might be called with a request that doesn't have its status set correctly. Maybe in some cases, the status wasn't updated before completing, or perhaps other parts of the code expect the status to be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the callers are now handling the request completion incorrectly after this change. The function scsi_handle_rw_error was modified to call scsi_req_complete when rerror=ignore returns true, but maybe that's not always appropriate.

I need to check what scsi_req_complete does. It probably sets the request's status and notifies any waiting functions. If the status isn't set correctly before calling it, then the assertion would fail because the function expects req->status to be -1.

In the commit, Paolo added a call to scsi_req_complete inside scsi_handle_rw_error when rerror=ignore is true. So let's look at that code change.

In the old code, after handling an error with rerror=ignore, it just returned without completing the request. The new code now calls scsi_req_complete(req, -5). This makes sense because if the error is ignored, we should still mark the request as complete so that any dependent code knows to proceed.

But wait, why would the assertion fail? Maybe in some cases, this call isn't supposed to happen. Or perhaps another part of the code expects req->status to be something else when scsi_req_complete is called.

Another possibility: The function scsi_req_complete sets req->status to a certain value, but maybe other functions rely on that status being set before completion. If the status wasn't properly set before this point, then after calling scsi_req_complete, it might not meet the assertion.

Alternatively, perhaps when the request is completed with a specific status, like -5 (which is probably ENOSYS or some other error), the code downstream expects req->status to be -1. Or maybe there's an issue where multiple completions are being called on the same request, leading to inconsistent states.

I should look at what happens after scsi_req_complete is called. Does it set req->status correctly? If yes, then why is the assertion failing?

Looking back, in the commit message, Paolo said that callers were not calling scsi_req_complete when rerror=ignore returns true, which was correct behavior. So he fixed that by adding the call.

But maybe after this change, another part of the code calls scsi_req_complete again on the same request, causing req->status to be set multiple times incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, the status isn't being initialized properly before any completion is called. For example, if the request's status was not set at all and then scsi_req_complete sets it to -5, but another part of the code expects it to be -1, leading to a crash when that assertion is hit.

Another angle: The function scsi_req_complete might itself have an issue where it doesn't correctly handle certain statuses. Maybe it's assuming that req->status must be -1 before proceeding, which is now not the case after this change.

I should check the implementation of scsi_req_complete. It probably does something like setting req->status to a specific value and then notifying other functions. If it expects req->status to be in a certain state, but that's not the case anymore, it could trigger an assertion or error.

In summary, the problem is likely that after adding the call to scsi_req_complete in scsi_handle_rw_error when rerror=ignore returns true, another part of the code (possibly during testing) ends up calling scsi_req_complete again on the same request with a different status, leading to an inconsistent state where req->status isn't what's expected by the assertion.

Alternatively, it could be that in some cases, the function calls scsi_req_complete without properly initializing req->status first. This would cause the assertion in scsi_req_complete to fail because it expects req->status to be -1 before proceeding.

To fix this, I might need to ensure that the request's status is set correctly before calling scsi_req_complete and that no multiple completions are attempted on the same request. Alternatively, perhaps the function should not rely on req->status being in a specific state upon entry but instead handle all cases appropriately.

The assertion failure occurs because `scsi_req_complete` expects `req->status` to be -1 when it's called, but after the fix, this isn't always the case. The root cause is that the commit correctly adds `scsi_req_complete`, but another part of the code might now incorrectly call it again or without proper status initialization.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assertion Failure:** The backtrace points to an assertion in `assert(req->status == -1)` within `scsi_req_complete`. This indicates that when this function is called, `req->status` isn't -1 as expected.

2. **Commit Analysis:** Paolo's commit adds a call to `scsi_req_complete` in `scsi_handle_rw_error` when handling ignored errors. Before the fix, callers neglected to complete the request properly upon ignoring an error.

3. **Possible Issues Post-Fix:**
   - The new completion might be called more than once on the same request.
   - Other parts of the code may not handle different `req->status` values correctly after this change.

4. **Investigating `scsi_req_complete`:** This function likely sets `req->status`. If it assumes a certain state (like status being unset), calling it without proper setup could cause issues.

5. **Potential Fixes:**
   - Ensure that `req->status` is correctly set before completing the request.
   - Prevent multiple calls to `scsi_req_complete` for the same request.
   - Modify `scsi_req_complete` to handle various status scenarios without relying on a specific initial state.

**Conclusion:**

The crash arises because after fixing the call to `scsi_req_complete`, another part of the code might be causing an improper completion or not initializing `req->status`. The solution involves ensuring that each request is completed only once with the correct status and that all relevant functions handle different statuses appropriately.
