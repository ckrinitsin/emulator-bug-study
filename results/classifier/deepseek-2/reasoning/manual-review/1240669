Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let's look at the details.

The user mentioned that running a tutorial caused an issue where `sd_init()` generates a SIGSEGV when passed NULL. They provided a link to the commit in sd.c and noted that reverting to tag v1.6.1 fixed it.

Looking at the code, `sd_init()` is called with potentially a NULL bs (BlockDriverState). Inside `sd_init()`, there's a line where `qemu_blockalign(bs, 512)` is called. If bs is NULL, this function would likely crash because passing NULL to functions expecting non-NULL pointers can cause segmentation faults.

The error occurs in block.c at `bdrv_is_read_only(bs)`. The problem stems from allowing a NULL bs into `sd_init()`, which then leads to accessing `bs->read_only` when it's null, causing SIGSEGV.

This issue is related to how the code handles the BlockDriverState. Since it's about improper handling of pointers and function arguments leading to a crash, it doesn't fit categories like 'network' or 'graphic'. Instead, it's more about incorrect usage of pointers in block driver operations.

So, the category should be 'block'.

The bug involves passing a NULL pointer to `sd_init()`, causing a SIGSEGV when accessing `bs->read_only`. This relates to improper handling of BlockDriverState pointers. 

Answer: block
