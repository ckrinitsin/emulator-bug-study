Okay, I'm looking at this problem where a user has provided some system call traces from QEMU that resulted in errors. They noticed that functions like set_robust_list and clone are marked as unimplemented with the errno 38. The user already reported the signal syscall issues elsewhere but is now focusing on these two problematic calls.

First, I need to understand what's causing these function calls to be unimplemented. Since they're using QEMU, which emulates system calls for a guest OS, it's possible that certain syscalls aren't properly implemented in the emulator. The error messages indicate that when these functions are called, the emulator doesn't recognize them.

Looking at set_robust_list, I recall that this syscall was introduced in Linux kernel 2.6. It allows processes to manage their robust list for handling cancellation in multithreaded applications. If QEMU's implementation of this syscall is incomplete or not present, it would result in the Function not implemented error.

For the clone syscall, it's a low-level system call used to create new processes or threads. The flags passed (like CLONE_VM and others) indicate that the process is attempting to create a thread with shared memory and other resources. If QEMU doesn't support this particular combination of flags or if there's an issue in how clone is emulated, it could lead to similar errors.

The user mentioned they've already reported the signal syscall issues separately, so now they're seeking help with these two specific calls. I should consider whether these are known issues in QEMU or if there are workarounds. It might be helpful to check QEMU's bug tracker for existing reports on set_robust_list and clone.

I also need to think about how to approach this as a new user trying to help them. They might not have access to the source code of QEMU, so suggesting ways to report bugs or find workarounds would be useful. Maybe there are alternative system calls they can use or configurations that avoid triggering these problematic syscalls.

In summary, the problem stems from missing implementations in QEMU's emulation of set_robust_list and clone. The user should look into whether others have encountered similar issues, check for updates or patches in QEMU, and consider reaching out to the community for assistance.

It seems you're encountering issues with certain system calls (`set_robust_list` and `clone`) being reported as unimplemented when running your program under QEMU. These errors indicate that QEMU's emulation of these syscalls is incomplete or not properly implemented.

### Understanding the Errors:
1. **set_robust_list**:
   - This syscall was introduced in Linux kernel 2.6.
   - It allows processes to maintain a list of robust pointers for cancellation in multithreaded applications.
   - If QEMU's emulation of this syscall is incomplete, it may not handle the necessary setup or cleanup correctly.

2. **clone**:
   - This system call creates a new process or thread, depending on the flags used.
   - The `CLONE_THREAD` flag suggests that the program is attempting to create a new thread in the same process.
   - Issues with the clone syscall could stem from missing support for certain flags or improper handling of threading contexts.

### Possible Solutions:
1. **Report the Issue**:
   - Since you've already opened a bug report, continue to provide detailed information about the environment and steps to reproduce the issue. Include any additional error messages or backtraces that might help developers diagnose the problem.

2. **Check QEMU Version**:
   - Ensure you're using the latest version of QEMU. If not, update to the latest stable release as the issue may have been fixed in a newer version.

3. **Use Alternative System Calls**:
   - Investigate if there are alternative ways to achieve the same functionality without relying on these syscalls. For example, using pthreads instead of `clone` for threading.

4. **Workarounds**:
   - If possible, modify your program to avoid triggering these syscalls. This may involve reworking how threads or memory protection is handled.

5. **Check QEMU's Documentation and Source Code**:
   - Review the QEMU documentation to see if there are known limitations with threading or specific system calls.
   - Look into the source code for `set_robust_list` and `clone` emulation in QEMU. If these functions aren't implemented, you might need to contribute patches or request their implementation.

### Conclusion:
The unimplemented syscalls indicate that your program is relying on features not fully supported by the version of QEMU you're using. By reporting the issue, staying updated with QEMU's development, and exploring alternative approaches, you can address these problems effectively.
