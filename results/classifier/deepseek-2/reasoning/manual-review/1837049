Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why my QEMU setup isn't working as expected when I use the `-display sdl` or switch to `-display gtk`. It boots directly to the desktop instead of starting in a window. Hmm, maybe there's something wrong with how the display options are being handled.

I remember that sometimes compatibility issues can cause unexpected behavior. Maybe my version of QEMU isn't fully compatible with certain display drivers when using SDL or GTK. I should check if there are any known issues with these display backends in my QEMU build.

Another thought: could it be related to the window manager? If the desktop environment is set up in a way that doesn't support the display options properly, maybe QEMU falls back to a different mode. Perhaps trying this on a different desktop or logging in as a different user might help isolate the issue.

I also noticed that when I changed the CPU type to G3, it worked better. Maybe there's a connection between the CPU emulation and how the display is handled. Could it be that certain display options require specific CPU features?

Wait, maybe I should look at the QEMU documentation or release notes to see if there were any changes related to display handling in my version of QEMU. If this behavior started recently, there might be a known bug or a fix available.

Also, perhaps adding more detailed logging with `-d display` could give me some clues about what's going wrong during the boot process. That way, I can see if QEMU is correctly initializing the display backend or if it's encountering an error that's being overlooked.

Another angle: checking for any conflicting environment variables might be useful. Sometimes, leftover variables from previous sessions can interfere with how programs run. Resetting them temporarily could help determine if they're causing the issue.

I should also consider whether I'm using the latest version of QEMU or if there are patches that address display issues. Updating to a newer version might resolve the problem entirely.

Lastly, maybe experimenting with different display resolutions or other hardware passthrough options could provide more insight into why the desktop isn't rendering correctly as expected.

The issue you're encountering with QEMU not starting in windowed mode when using `-display sdl` or `-display gtk`, and instead booting directly to the desktop, can be addressed by considering a few potential solutions:

1. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure that your version of QEMU is compatible with the chosen display backend (SDL or GTK). Look for any known issues or updates in the QEMU documentation or community forums.

2. **Update QEMU**: If using an older version, consider updating to the latest release as newer versions may have fixed bugs related to display handling.

3. **Environment Variables**: Reset any conflicting environment variables that might interfere with QEMU's display initialization by starting a fresh session or using a clean shell profile.

4. **Window Manager Settings**: Test on a different desktop environment or user account to rule out issues specific to your current setup.

5. **Logging**: Add the `-d display` option to enable detailed logging, which can provide insights into whether QEMU is correctly initializing the display backend.

6. **Alternative Display Drivers**: Experiment with other display backends supported by QEMU to see if they function as expected.

7. **Hardware and Software Configuration**: Ensure that your system meets all requirements for both the CPU type (e.g., G3) and the graphical output settings specified in your command line arguments.

By systematically testing these potential solutions, you should be able to identify why the desktop is not rendering correctly and adjust your configuration accordingly to resolve the issue.
