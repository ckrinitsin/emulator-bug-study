Okay, so I'm trying to fix these compilation errors in the ui/gtk.c file. The errors are about deprecated functions from GTK+. Let me see what each error is and how I can update the code.

First, looking at the first error: it says that 'gdk_device_ungrab' is declared here, but the function name seems correct. Wait, no, actually, the note points to where the function is declared. So maybe that's not an issue yet.

The next errors are in functions gd_grab_pointer and gd_ungrab_pointer. They're using gdk_display_get_device_manager, which is deprecated. The message suggests using gdk_display_get_default_seat instead. I remember that GTK+ 3.22 introduced gdk_display_get_default_seat as a replacement for gdk_display_get_device_manager.

So in the code, whenever we have gdk_display_get_device_manager(display), we should replace it with gdk_display_get_default_seat(display). Let me check where this is used:

In gd_grab_pointer, line 1392:
GdkDeviceManager *mgr = gdk_display_get_device_manager(display);

This needs to change to:
GdkSeat *seat = gdk_display_get_default_seat(display);

Then, in the same function, at line 1400, there's a call to gdk_device_manager_get_client_pointer(mgr). The error says this is deprecated. Looking up, I think that with seats, you can get the pointer device directly from the seat.

So instead of getting the client pointer from the manager, we should use seat->pointer.

Wait, but in GTK+, the seat's pointer is accessed via gdk_seat_get_pointer(). Or maybe it's a property? Let me check. Oh right, I think it's a function: gdk_seat_get_pointer(seat).

So line 1400:
gdk_device_get_position(gdk_device_manager_get_client_pointer(mgr), ... 

Should become:
gdk_device_get_position(gdk_seat_get_pointer(seat), ... 

Similarly, in gd_ungrab_pointer, lines 1432 and 1434 have the same issues. So I'll replace gdk_display_get_device_manager with gdk_display_get_default_seat and then use seat->pointer or gdk_seat_get_pointer.

Putting it all together:

In both functions:
- Replace mgr = gdk_display_get_device_manager(display) with seat = gdk_display_get_default_seat(display).
- Replace gdk_device_manager_get_client_pointer(mgr) with gdk_seat_get_pointer(seat).

I should also check if the variables are correctly typed. So 'mgr' was a GdkDeviceManager*, but now it's a GdkSeat*. I'll need to change variable types accordingly.

Let me outline the steps for gd_grab_pointer:

1. Change line 1392:
   From: GdkDeviceManager *mgr = gdk_display_get_device_manager(display);
   To: GdkSeat *seat = gdk_display_get_default_seat(display);

2. Then, in the function call at line 1400:
   Replace gdk_device_manager_get_client_pointer(mgr) with gdk_seat_get_pointer(seat).

Same for gd_ungrab_pointer:

1. Change line 1432:
   From: GdkDeviceManager *mgr = gdk_display_get_device_manager(display);
   To: GdkSeat *seat = gdk_display_get_default_seat(display);

2. Then, in the function call at line 1434:
   Replace gdk_device_manager_get_client_pointer(mgr) with gdk_seat_get_pointer(seat).

I think that should fix all these deprecation issues.

Wait, also need to make sure that 'seat' is not NULL. Should we add a check? Maybe if seat is NULL, handle it appropriately or avoid crashes.

Another thought: Are there other functions in the codebase using similar deprecated functions? But for now, I'm only focusing on these two functions causing the errors.

So putting it all together, here are the changes needed:

In gd_grab_pointer:
- Assign seat instead of mgr.
- Use seat to get pointer device.

Similarly for gd_ungrab_pointer.

I think that should resolve those compilation errors related to deprecated GTK+ functions. Let me write out how each line would look after these changes.
</think>

To address the deprecation warnings in the GTK+ code, we need to replace the deprecated functions with their updated alternatives. Here's a step-by-step explanation and the corrected code:

**Step 1: Replace Deprecated Functions**

- **`gdk_display_get_device_manager(display)`** is deprecated; use **`gdk_display_get_default_seat(display)`** instead.
- **`gdk_device_manager_get_client_pointer(mgr)`** is deprecated; get the pointer from the seat using **`gdk_seat_get_pointer(seat)`**.

**Step 2: Update Variable Types**

Change variable types from `GdkDeviceManager*` to `GdkSeat*`.

**Corrected Code for `gd_grab_pointer`:**

```c
void gd_grab_pointer(GdkDisplay *display, guint32 timestamp)
{
    GdkSeat *seat = gdk_display_get_default_seat(display);
    if (seat) {
        GdkDevice *pointer = gdk_seat_get_pointer(seat);
        if (pointer) {
            gdk_device_get_position(pointer, NULL, NULL);  // Example usage
            // Rest of the function as needed
        }
    }
}
```

**Corrected Code for `gd_ungrab_pointer`:**

```c
void gd_ungrab_pointer(GdkDisplay *display, guint32 timestamp)
{
    GdkSeat *seat = gdk_display_get_default_seat(display);
    if (seat) {
        GdkDevice *pointer = gdk_seat_get_pointer(seat);
        if (pointer) {
            gdk_device_setGrab(pointer, FALSE, NULL, 0);  // Example usage
            // Rest of the function as needed
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`gdk_display_get_default_seat(display)`**: Retrieves the seat associated with the display. Each seat represents a collection of devices (like mouse and keyboard) for a particular input context.
  
- **`gdk_seat_get_pointer(seat)`**: Fetches the pointer device from the seat, which replaces the old way of getting it via `gdk_device_manager_get_client_pointer()`.

By making these changes, we ensure compatibility with newer GTK+ versions while adhering to current practices. Additionally, always check if `seat` and the retrieved devices are non-NULL to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior.
