Okay, I'm looking at this problem where some feature bits in QEMU's target/arm/cpu.h file are causing issues after a specific commit. The user has provided the details of bisecting the code to find where things went wrong.

From what I can gather, the git bisect process identified that the first bad commit is [f9506e162c33e87b609549157dd8431fcc732085], which removes ARM_FEATURE_VFP*, VFP3, and VFP4. The issue arises because some parts of the code still rely on these feature bits not being present.

So, I need to figure out why removing these features is causing problems. Let's look at the diff provided:

In target/arm/cpu.h, lines 1880-1900 are modified. ARM_FEATURE_VFP, VFP3, and VFP4 are removed from the enum arm_features. These features were used elsewhere in QEMU to determine if certain instructions or behaviors should be enabled.

The root cause is likely that some parts of the codebase still reference these removed feature bits. For example, the comment mentions that ARM_FEATURE_VFP was referenced in linux-user/elfload.c:get_elf_hwcap(). If this function relies on VFP features being set, it might break after their removal.

I should check where these features were used elsewhere. Maybe other parts of QEMU or the user's codebase still expect these feature bits to exist. Removing them without updating all dependent parts would cause inconsistencies and potential bugs.

To fix this, I need to:

1. Identify all places in the code that use ARM_FEATURE_VFP*, VFP3, or VFP4.
2. Update those sections to either remove references or replace them with the correct feature bits that are still present, like ARM_FEATURE_NEON for VFPv4 maybe.

Also, since these features were part of older VFP versions, perhaps the code should transition to using newer feature definitions that QEMU now supports, ensuring compatibility across different ARM architectures.

The key steps would involve:

- Updating any functions that check for VFP* features.
- Ensuring that the HWCAP values are correctly set without relying on removed features.
- Testing affected areas to confirm that all dependencies have been addressed and no regressions remain.

To resolve the inconsistency caused by removing `ARM_FEATURE_VFP*` in QEMU's ARM target, we need to update code that relies on these feature bits. The main issue is that some parts of QEMU still reference these features after their removal.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Dependent Code Sections:**
   - Look through the entire QEMU source for places where `ARM_FEATURE_VFP`, `VFP3`, or `VFP4` are used.
   - Notable areas include:
     - ELF HWCAP generation in `linux-user/elfload.c`.
     - VFP and NEON instruction handling in `target/arm/`.

2. **Update HWCAP Generation:**
   - Modify `get_elf_hwcap()` to no longer check for removed features.
   - Replace references with the appropriate current feature flags, such as using `NEON` where applicable.

3. **Adjust VFP and NEON Handling:**
   - In the ARM target's instruction decoding and execution, ensure that any VFP-specific logic is updated to use existing or new feature flags correctly.

4. **Test Affected Components:**
   - Compile QEMU and run tests focusing on ARM targets with/without VFP/NEON support.
   - Verify that no regressions occur and that all features work as expected.

**Answer:**

The inconsistency arises because some parts of QEMU still reference the removed `ARM_FEATURE_VFP*` flags. To fix this, update dependent code sections to use current feature definitions. This involves modifying functions like `get_elf_hwcap()` and ensuring VFP/NEON handling uses appropriate flags.
