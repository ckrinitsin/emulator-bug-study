Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking here. They provided two QEMU/KVM command lines and mentioned that one of them is broken with a usb-tablet qxl issue.

Looking at both commands, I notice they are almost identical except for some parts. The first one doesn't have the `usb-ehci`, `usb-kbd`, or `usb-tablet` devices, while the second one does. But in the second command, the `qxl` device is present, which might be causing conflicts.

I remember that QXL is a GPU driver, and if it's not properly supported or if there are issues with the host drivers, it can cause problems. The user mentioned "usb-tablet qxl" as broken, so maybe the USB tablet isn't working because of how it's connected to the QEMU machine.

I should check if the devices are correctly added. In the second command, `usb-ehci`, `usb-kbd`, and `usb-tablet` are all on bus=input.0. But perhaps there's a conflict or they're not being recognized properly.

Also, looking at the first command, it uses Virtio Serial Port for spice and Virtio 9p for filesystem sharing. Maybe that setup is more stable without the USB devices causing issues.

I think the user wants to fix the broken configuration where the USB tablet isn't working with QXL. So, the solution might be to either remove the conflicting devices or ensure all dependencies are properly set up.

The commands you provided appear to be QEMU/KVM virtual machine configurations for running macOS Big Sur in a virtual environment. However, there is a discrepancy between the two commands that needs clarification.

### First Command (Working Configuration):
```
/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -name macos-big-sur,process=macos-big-sur -pidfile macos-big-sur/macos-big-sur.pid -enable-kvm -machine q35,smm=off,vmport=off -device isa-applesmc,osk=ourhardworkbythesewordsguardedpleasedontsteal\(c\)AppleComputerInc -no-hpet -global kvm-pit.lost_tick_policy=discard -cpu host,kvm=on,vendor=GenuineIntel,+hypervisor,+invtsc,+kvm_pv_eoi,+kvm_pv_unhalt -smp cores=2,threads=1,sockets=1 -m 8G -device virtio-balloon -fsdev local,id=fsdev0,path=/home/jmorrison/Public,security_model=mapped-xattr -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=fsdev0,mount_tag=Public-jmorrison
```

This configuration appears to be a working setup for running macOS Big Sur in a QEMU/KVM virtual machine. It includes:

1. **Basic VM Configuration**:
   - `-name`: Specifies the name of the VM (`macos-big-sur`).
   - `-pidfile`: Creates a PID file for the VM process.
   - `-enable-kvm`: Enables KVM acceleration for better performance.

2. **Machine Type and Features**:
   - `-machine q35`: Uses the Q35 machine type, which is compatible with newer Intel processors.
   - `-smm=off` and `-vmport=off`: Disables SMM (System Management Mode) and VMPORT features.

3. **Processor Configuration**:
   - `-cpu host,kvm=on,vendor=GenuineIntel,+hypervisor,+invtsc,+kvm_pv_eoi,+kvm_pv_unhalt`: Configures the CPU with specific features enabled for KVM acceleration.

4. ** SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing)**:
   - `-smp cores=2,threads=1,sockets=1`: Configures 2 cores, 1 thread per core, and 1 socket.

5. **Memory**:
   - `-m 8G`: Allocates 8GB of memory to the VM.

6. **Devices**:
   - `-device virtio-balloon`: Enables VirtIO balloon device for dynamic memory management.
   - `-fsdev local,id=fsdev0,path=/home/jmorrison/Public,security_model=mapped-xattr` and `-device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=fsdev0,mount_tag=Public-jmorrison`: Configures VirtIO 9P filesystem for sharing the `/home/jmorrison/Public` directory with the VM.

### Second Command (Broken Configuration):
```
/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -name macos-big-sur,process=macos-big-sur -pidfile macos-big-sur/macos-big-sur.pid -enable-kvm -machine q35,smm=off,vmport=off -device isa-applesmc,osk=ourhardworkbythesewordsguardedpleasedontsteal\(c\)AppleComputerInc -no-hpet -global kvm-pit.lost_tick_policy=discard -cpu host,kvm=on,vendor=GenuineIntel,+hypervisor,+invtsc,+kvm_pv_eoi,+kvm_pv_unhalt -smp cores=2,threads=1,sockets=1 -m 8G -device virtio-balloon -fsdev local,id=fsdev0,path=/home/jmorrison/Public,security_model=mapped-xattr -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=fsdev0,mount_tag=Public-jmorrison
```

This configuration is identical to the first command except for the inclusion of additional devices related to USB and QXL:

1. **USB Devices**:
   - `-device usb-ehci`: Adds a USB Enhanced Host Controller.
   - `-device usb-kbd`: Adds a USB keyboard device.
   - `-device usb-tablet`: Adds a USB tablet device.

2. **QXL Device**:
   - The inclusion of `qxl` suggests that this configuration is attempting to use the QXL GPU driver, which may conflict with other devices or configurations.

### Analysis of the Broken Configuration:
The broken configuration likely fails due to conflicts between the VirtIO 9P filesystem and the additional USB/QXL devices. Specifically:

1. **VirtIO 9P Filesystem**:
   - The VirtIO 9P filesystem (`-fsdev local,id=fsdev0,path=/home/jmorrison/Public,security_model=mapped-xattr` and `-device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=fsdev0,mount_tag=Public-jmorrison`) allows the VM to access files on the host system. However, this configuration can conflict with other devices if they are not properly managed.

2. **USB Devices**:
   - The inclusion of USB devices (`usb-ehci`, `usb-kbd`, `usb-tablet`) may interfere with the VirtIO 9P filesystem or other components if they are not correctly configured.

3. **QXL Device**:
   - QXL is a GPU driver that can be challenging to configure, especially in KVM environments. Conflicts between QXL and other devices (e.g., VirtIO) are possible.

### Suggested Fixes:
1. **Remove Conflicting Devices**:
   - If the VirtIO 9P filesystem is not necessary, it can be removed from both commands. This would simplify the configuration and reduce potential conflicts.

2. **Ensure Proper USB Configuration**:
   - If USB devices (e.g., keyboard or tablet) are required, ensure they are properly configured in the VM. This may involve setting up a USB host device or using VirtIO USB Passthrough if supported by your hardware and hypervisor.

3. **Reconfigure QXL**:
   - If QXL is necessary for GPU acceleration, ensure that it is correctly configured with the appropriate drivers on both the host and guest systems. Verify that the QEMU/KVM installation includes support for QXL and that the corresponding kernel modules are loaded.

4. **Test Without Conflicting Devices**:
   - Start by running the working configuration without any additional devices (e.g., USB, QXL). If this works, gradually add back the required devices to identify the source of the conflict.

### Final Thoughts:
The second command is likely failing due to conflicts between the VirtIO 9P filesystem and other devices. To resolve the issue, simplify the configuration by removing unnecessary or conflicting devices until you identify the root cause of the failure. Once a stable base configuration is established, add back the required components one at a time to ensure compatibility.
