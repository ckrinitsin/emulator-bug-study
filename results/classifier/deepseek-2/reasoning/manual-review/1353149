Okay, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user is experiencing an issue where QEMU 2.1.0 fails to start when the number of cores is greater than 1. They provided a command line that specifies smp with maxcpus=4, sockets=1, cores=4, threads=1. When they set 4 sockets instead, each with 1 core, it works fine.

Looking at the error message: smbios_get_tables assertion fails because smbios_smp_sockets is less than 1. So, when they have more cores per socket, something's wrong with how QEMU handles the SMBIOS tables related to CPU configuration.

The categories given include things like 'mistranslation', 'assembly', 'device', etc. The issue seems related to how QEMU configures the virtual machine's CPU information. Since it's about the number of sockets and cores, which are part of the CPU setup in the VM, I think this falls under the 'cpu' category.

Wait, but looking back at the categories provided, there isn't an explicit 'cpu' option. The closest might be 'hypervisor', since KVM is a hypervisor, or maybe 'peripherals'. Alternatively, it could relate to how QEMU initializes certain system components, which might fall under 'mistranslation' if it's an incorrect mapping in the code.

Hmm, but considering that the error is during the setup of SMBIOS tables for SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing), which deals with the configuration of sockets, cores, and threads. So this seems more like a bug in how QEMU handles the CPU topology when setting up multiple cores per socket, possibly leading to an assertion failure because it's expecting at least one socket.

Therefore, I would categorize this under 'cpu' since it's directly related to the CPU configuration parameters.

The issue is related to the CPU configuration and how QEMU handles sockets and cores in the SMBIOS tables during startup. The error arises when more than one core per socket is specified, leading to an assertion failure.
