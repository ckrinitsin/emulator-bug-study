Alright, I'm trying to figure out why the VHDX files are getting corrupted. Let me go through all this information step by step.

First, from the logs, it looks like when using certain setups with QEMU and different kernels, corruption happens more often than not. Specifically, they mentioned that corruption occurs with different configurations involving Fedora 35 and either kernel 5.17 or 4.18.0-348.el8. They're using various filesystems like ExFAT, ntfs3, ext4, and qcow2, along with VHDX as the virtual disk format.

Looking at the test cases:
- Corruption happens when they use VHDX with different kernels (5.17 and 4.18). So it's not just a specific kernel issue but seems to affect multiple versions.
- When using other formats like qcow2, especially in some configurations, corruption doesn't happen as much, or at least isn't reported. So the problem might be isolated to VHDX.

The user also pointed out that NTFS3 and ExFAT are new or recently mainstreamed filesystems, but they don't think those are the culprits because the operations being performed (throughput, copying files) aren't too complex. It's more about how data is being written and read across the virtual disks.

The main suspect seems to be the VHDX support in QEMU. They provided some code links for the block drivers related to VHDX in QEMU, which makes sense because if there are bugs in how QEMU handles VHDX, it could cause corruption during I/O operations.

They mentioned that adding stress and throughput test cases to QEMU's test suite would help identify issues with VHDX. That sounds logicalâ€”more testing under various conditions might uncover the specific problems.

Another point is that this issue occurs when using qemu-nbd or within a QEMU VM, suggesting it's related to how QEMU handles network block devices or virtual disks in certain configurations.

So, putting it all together, the likely cause of corruption is a bug in QEMU's VHDX implementation. The kernel doesn't seem to be the main issue since different kernels are affected, and other filesystems aren't pointing to kernel problems. It's more about how QEMU reads/writes to VHDX files.

To fix this, I should look into the QEMU code related to VHDX (block/vhdx.c, block/vhdx_log.c, etc.) for potential bugs, especially in handling disk operations under stress or high throughput conditions. Adding thorough test cases would help catch these issues during testing.

The issue is caused by a bug in QEMU's implementation of the VHDX virtual disk format, particularly affecting how it handles I/O operations under certain conditions such as stress and high throughput. The corruption occurs when using VHDX with various configurations involving different kernels (5.17.x and 4.18.0-348.el8), but not consistently across other formats like qcow2.

**Solution:**

1. **Investigate QEMU's VHDX Code:**
   - Review the provided QEMU files (`block/vhdx.c`, `block/vhdx_log.c`, etc.) to identify potential bugs in reading/writing operations, especially under stress or high load.
   - Look for issues in how headers and metadata are handled, which could lead to corruption.

2. **Enhance Testing:**
   - Add VHDX-specific stress and throughput test cases to QEMU's test suite to simulate heavy I/O workloads and identify stability issues.

3. **Update Documentation:**
   - Advise users against using VHDX for critical data until the issue is resolved, especially in high-throughput scenarios.

By addressing these points, the root cause of the corruption can be identified and fixed within QEMU's VHDX driver.
