Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user mentioned they're using qemu-nbd to export an image and libnbd for read/write operations. They noticed that when using nbd_block_status, it returns -1 with the error "Invalid argument". 

Looking at the provided code, the main issue seems to be related to how nbd_block_status is being called. The user is checking if the return value is -1 and then printing an error message. But from what I know, in libnbd, functions like nbd_block_status typically return 0 on success and -1 on failure. However, sometimes they might use different error codes or messages based on specific conditions.

Wait, but actually, looking at the code, when nbd_block_status is called, it returns an integer. If it's -1, that indicates an error. So the user's approach of checking for -1 and then getting the error message makes sense because libnbd functions usually return 0 on success and negative values (like -1) or positive integers as status codes.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The main issue here is that when nbd_block_status fails, it returns -1, which isn't handled properly in the code, leading to a potential crash or incorrect behavior. So the bug is likely related to how errors are being handled after calling nbd_block_status.

Looking at the categories provided: kernel modules, network drivers, user space applications, file systems. Since this involves qemu-nbd (which is part of QEMU) and libnbd, which I believe runs in user space, the problem seems to be within a user-space application rather than something related to kernel modules or network drivers.

So, putting it all together, the bug report is about an issue in a user-space application when handling errors from nbd_block_status. Therefore, the correct category should be "user space applications".

The bug report describes an issue with the `nbd_block_status` function returning `-1` and an error message "Invalid argument" when used in a user-space application context. The problem lies in how the function handles errors after being called, specifically within a user-space environment using QEMU's nbd protocol.

**Classification:**  
- **User space applications**

This classification is based on the context provided, which involves user-space interactions with QEMU and libnbd functions, rather than kernel modules or network drivers.
