Okay, I'm trying to figure out why the program is not running when using the -armpl flag both with and without Docker on a Taishan tsv110 and Kunpeng 920 system. Let me break down what's happening.

First, from the user's message, it seems that when they compile and run their program with the -armpl flag, they get an error: "qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU" and context @ pc=0xffffaaa8844a. This is causing the program to fail.

Looking at the ldd outputs for both cases:

1) With -armpl flag:
The output shows several libraries being loaded, including libamath_generic.so, libm.so.6, etc., but importantly, it's using specific paths from the arm-linux-compiler directory. There are multiple .so files mapped to different addresses.

2) Without -armpl flag:
The program runs successfully and the ldd output shows fewer libraries, mainly libc.so.6 and some others, but notably, libastring_generic.so is also present.

I'm thinking that the issue might be related to how the linker is resolving these shared objects when the armpl flag is used. Perhaps there's a conflict or missing dependency when using armpl, leading to the signal error.

Possible steps I can take:

1. Check if all necessary armpl libraries are correctly installed and accessible.
2. Ensure that the system has compatible versions of the C standard library and other dependencies when using armpl.
3. Maybe try cross-compiling with armpl on a different machine or environment to see if the issue persists.
4. Look into any known issues with armpl and Docker setups, as the problem occurs both inside and outside Docker.

I'm not entirely sure why using armpl would cause this specific signal error. It might be related to library version mismatches or incorrect linking steps when compiling with -armpl. Perhaps there's an issue with how QEMU is handling certain instructions when armpl libraries are involved, leading to the signal being thrown outside the vCPU context.

I should also consider checking if the system has the required permissions to access all these shared libraries and if they're properly stripped or optimized for performance. Maybe running the program under a debugger like GDB could provide more insights into where exactly the error is occurring and why it's happening.

The issue you're encountering when using the `-armpl` flag likely stems from incorrect linking or missing dependencies, possibly due to conflicts between the ARMPL libraries and system libraries. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Ensure Correct Installation of ARMPL:**
   - Verify that all ARMPL-related libraries (e.g., `libastring_generic.so`, `libamath_generic.so`) are properly installed in your build environment.
   - Check if the paths to these libraries are correctly set in your system's `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or equivalent.

2. **Check for Compatible Libraries:**
   - Ensure that the versions of `libc.so.6` and other standard libraries used by ARMPL are compatible with each other.
   - Compare the library versions when using `-armpl` versus without to identify discrepancies.

3. **Cross-Compilation Verification:**
   - Compile your program on a different machine or environment where ARMPL is working correctly to see if the issue persists. If it works elsewhere, the problem lies in your current setup.

4. **Update System Libraries:**
   - Ensure that all system libraries (e.g., `libc`, `libm`) are up-to-date and compatible with the version of ARMPL you're using.
   - Reinstall or update any outdated library packages.

5. **Inspect Build Commands:**
   - Review your build commands to confirm that `-armpl` is correctly invoked and that all necessary linker flags are included.
   - Ensure that no conflicting flags are being passed that might interfere with the linking process.

6. **Run Under Debugger:**
   - Use a debugger like GDB to capture where exactly the signal occurs (`pc=0xffffaaa8844a`). This can provide clues about which library or function is causing the issue, helping you pinpoint missing dependencies or incorrect mappings.

7. **Check Docker Configuration:**
   - If using Docker, ensure that the container has access to all required libraries and that the paths are correctly mounted.
   - Verify that Docker isn't isolating certain system resources needed by ARMPL.

8. **Consult Documentation and Forums:**
   - Refer to the official ARMPL documentation for any known issues or specific requirements when using it with Docker or on Taishan/Kunpeng hardware.
   - Search online forums or communities for similar issues, as others might have encountered and resolved the same problem.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the signal error and resolve the issue when compiling and running your program with the `-armpl` flag.
