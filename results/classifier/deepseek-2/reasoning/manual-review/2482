Alright, I need to classify this bug report from QEMU. Let's see what it's about.

The user described an issue during live migration where a BLOCK_JOB_ERROR occurs after disk migration is done and RAM migration starts. The problem arises when in 'pre-switchover' state, the block jobs are still marked as 'ready' instead of 'running', leading to an error because their offset and length diverge.

Looking at the steps to reproduce, it involves setting up blockdev-add for disks on the source host, starting mirror operations, initiating RAM migration, and then checking the status. On the destination, they start NBD server and add disks.

The bug is related to how block jobs are handled during live migration, particularly their state transitions. Since this affects disk I/O and data transfer, it falls under the broader category of block device handling.

Among the provided categories, 'block' seems appropriate because the issue pertains to block job statuses not updating correctly during migration.

The bug report discusses an issue with block jobs during live migration, specifically regarding their state transitions. The problem occurs when the block job status remains in 'ready' instead of transitioning to 'running', leading to a BLOCK_JOB_ERROR. This is directly related to block device operations and data transfer.
