Okay, so I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report is about scrolling not working once the mouse is grabbed. The user mentions that it occurs in Windows 10 RS1 on QEMU 2.7.0. They note that scrolling works when the mouse isn't grabbed but stops after using Ctrl+Alt+G to grab it. They're using Arch Linux as the host, and QEMU uses GTK3 by default for the GUI. Trying SDL didn't work because it's broken.

Let me break this down. The issue is with mouse input handling in the graphical user interface of QEMU. When the mouse is grabbed, scrolling stops. This seems related to how the input events are being handled by QEMU's display or windowing system.

Looking at the categories: 

- "device" could relate to hardware devices, but this is about mouse input.
- "graphic" deals with graphical user interface issues, which fits because it's about the display and mouse interaction.
- "peripherals" might be a possibility since the mouse is a peripheral device, but the issue seems more specific to the GUI handling rather than the device itself.

Other categories like network or kernel don't seem relevant here. It's not a translation issue (mistranslation), nor an assembly problem. The performance isn't mentioned as being an issue. Permissions and files are also unrelated.

So, between "graphic" and "peripherals", I think "graphic" is more appropriate because the bug is about how the mouse input interacts with the display or windowing system in QEMU's GUI.

The issue pertains to the graphical interface handling of mouse input when grabbed. Therefore, it falls under:

**graphic**
