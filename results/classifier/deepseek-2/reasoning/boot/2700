Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The problem is that Windows 11 fails to boot and just restarts. Let's look at the details.

The user mentioned they're using an M4 Pro Mac with TCG (which stands for Type 1 Hypervisor in KVM terms) and also others have reported similar issues on M3 and Intel i9 systems using HVF (Type 2 Hypervisor). 

Since the issue occurs during booting, that points towards a problem related to how QEMU handles the boot process. The failure is happening consistently across different hardware setups, which suggests it's not specific to user-mode but more likely in the hypervisor or kernel part of QEMU.

Looking at the categories: there's 'boot' which seems relevant here. Other possible categories like 'hypervisor' could be a contender because TCG and HVF are part of KVM (a hypervisor), but since the primary issue is booting, 'boot' might be more specific. 

I don't see any mention of network, graphics, or other peripherals specifically causing the problem. It's purely about the OS not booting correctly, so 'boot' seems appropriate.
