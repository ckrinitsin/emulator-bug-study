Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user had an issue where their VM wasn't booting when they added a "-initrd" image. They noticed that the initrd was 270 MB but didn't set enough RAM for QEMU. The default seemed to be around 120 MB, which caused the problem.

The user suggests that QEMU's pseudo-bootloader should detect this issue and display an error message about the total boot images exceeding the allocated memory.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, other.

The bug is related to the boot process because it's about the VM not starting correctly. The issue arises from the sum of kernel and initrd images exceeding the RAM size, which affects the booting phase. The user mentions the pseudo-bootloader, which is part of the boot process in QEMU. So this seems directly tied to the boot category.

I don't see it fitting into other categories like network or graphic because those are unrelated here. It's not a performance issue or kernel problem per se, but rather an error during the initial boot setup.
