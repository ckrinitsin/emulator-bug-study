Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is reporting that QEMU 7.0.0-rc4 doesn't launch on Windows and immediately exits without any output. 

First, I'll look at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is that QEMU isn't starting at all on Windows. Since it's exiting immediately without any version info or output, this suggests a problem during the initial launch phase. I'm thinking about what could cause QEMU not to start. It might be an issue with how QEMU is handling Windows-specific initialization.

Looking through the categories, "boot" seems relevant because it refers to issues related to starting up the program. If there's a problem during the boot process of QEMU on Windows, that would explain why it exits immediately without any output. 

Other possibilities could be related to permissions or files if QEMU can't access certain resources, but since the user didn't mention any specific error messages or file issues, "boot" seems more likely. It might also be a problem with how QEMU is handling Windows-specific code or initialization steps, which falls under the boot category.

So, I think the appropriate classification here is "boot."
