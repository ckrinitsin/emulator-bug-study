Okay, so I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The user says that after updating to QEMU 5.2.0, they can't start Windows; it just shows a black screen. They mention that it worked before the update and now they want to go back but can't. 

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Hmm, since QEMU is a hypervisor, but in this case, it's not starting Windows properly, which might be related to how the virtual machine boots. The issue seems to be with the boot process after an update. So maybe 'boot' is the category here because it's about the VM failing to start.

Alternatively, could it be something else? Let me thinkâ€”'graphic' if there was a display problem, but the user mentions a black screen, which might relate to boot issues rather than graphics. 'network' doesn't seem relevant unless Windows relies on network drivers during boot. But the main issue is that Windows isn't starting at all.

Yes, I think 'boot' is the most appropriate category here because it's about the VM not booting correctly after an update.
