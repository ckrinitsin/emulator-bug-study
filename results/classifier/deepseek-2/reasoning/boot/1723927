Okay, let's break down this bug report to classify it properly. The user mentioned that both Windows Server 2012 DC and RedHat7.0 guests are failing to boot using UEFI on an Intel Xeon X5675 CPU. They provided the command line with various QEMU options and specified the use of OVMF as the BIOS.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue occurs during the boot process with UEFI, specifically mentioning TianoCore and VNCviewer. The problem seems to be related to how QEMU is handling the boot process with UEFI firmware. Since the user tried a different EDK2 version but still faced issues, it points towards a configuration or compatibility problem in the boot setup rather than hardware or performance.

Considering the categories, 'boot' fits because the failure occurs during the guest OS boot phase. It's not related to translation errors (mistranslation), assembly code lowering (assembly), or other peripheral devices (peripherals) directly, but more about the boot process itself.
