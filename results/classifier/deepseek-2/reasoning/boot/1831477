Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read the report carefully.

The user is talking about updating the edk2 submodule and binaries in QEMU to a new version, edk2-stable201905. They provided links related to the release planning and the upcoming tag on GitHub.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, other.

EDK2 is related to UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which is part of the firmware that runs on x86 platforms during the boot process. QEMU uses EDK2 for certain emulated hardware and booting processes.

So, updating the EDK2 submodule would affect how QEMU handles the boot process or the firmware initialization. The category 'boot' seems appropriate here because it's directly related to the system startup phase.
