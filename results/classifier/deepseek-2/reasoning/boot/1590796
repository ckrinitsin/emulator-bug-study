Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user reports that when using QEMU 2.6.0 to install Windows 7, it hangs on the splash screen. However, it works fine with version 2.5.1. They provided two scripts: one that uses VirtIO drives and another simpler script using IDE drives. Both result in the same issue.

Looking at the possible categories, I need to figure out which one fits this bug. The problem occurs during installation (boot process), so 'boot' seems relevant. However, let me check other possibilities.

The user mentioned KVM is enabled, but the issue isn't specific to KVM; it's more about the install process failing. So 'KVM' might not be the best fit unless it's a hypervisor-related issue.

They're using VirtIO devices and network configurations, but the problem is with the installation hanging, which points more towards booting rather than device or network issues.

The other categories like 'graphic', 'network', 'socket' don't seem to apply here. It's not about assembly lowering or mistranslation. The issue isn't related to files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, debug, vnc, or sound.

So the most fitting category is 'boot' because it's during the boot process that the installation hangs.

The bug report describes an issue where installing Windows 7 using QEMU hangs at the splash screen in version 2.6.0 but works in 2.5.1. The problem occurs regardless of whether VirtIO or IDE drives are used, pointing to a regression related to booting the installation process.
