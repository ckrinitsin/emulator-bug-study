Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report about QEMU. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user mentioned they were using QEMU-SYSTEM-PPC64 version 3.1.0 and it worked fine with CentOS7. But when they upgraded to QEMU-4.0.0, the system stopped booting. They had to downgrade back to 3.1.0 for it to work again. So the issue is that the image boots under an older version but not a newer one.

They provided the command line arguments they're using, including specifying the CPU as POWER7 and machine type pseries. The network setup seems standard with e1000 and bridge. The host system is Manjaro Linux on an Intel i7 machine.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, other.

The problem occurs during booting, so that makes me think of the 'boot' category. They can't get past the boot process with QEMU-4.0.0 but could before. It's likely something related to how QEMU handles the boot process now compared to the previous version.

I don't see any mention of network issues, so probably not a networking problem. Similarly, no graphics or device-specific errors were reported. The issue is specifically about the system failing to start up, which points towards a boot-related bug in QEMU's code when handling PPC64 systems.
