Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is having trouble booting an MPS3-AN547 machine with images larger than 512KiB. They tried moving symbols to other memory areas but ended up with discontinuous memory, causing a large image that doesn't boot. They also mentioned the QSPI ROM area but noted it can't be used as bootram due to remapping limitations.

Looking at the steps to reproduce, they generated an image beyond 512K and tried using it as the kernel. The error was about not being able to load the kernel.

The additional info shows their linker script with flash starting at 0x00000000 for 512K, sram1 at 0x01000000 for 2M, and sram2 at 0x21000000 for 4M. The problem is that the flash overflows when trying to fit a larger image.

The main issue here seems to be related to how memory is being managed during boot. Specifically, it's about the kernel image size exceeding the allocated flash area and not being able to load properly. Since they're using QEMU's MPS3-AN547 machine and dealing with bootram limitations, this falls under the boot category because it's directly affecting the system's ability to boot from the kernel image.

I don't think it's related to translations or assembly since the problem is about memory allocation during boot. It's more about hardware configuration and how QEMU handles booting on specific devices.
