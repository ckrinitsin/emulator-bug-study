Alright, I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. The issue is about older OS's not detecting CD changes correctly.

The problem occurs with FreeBSD 2.2 and FreeDOS 1.2 when using the change command on an IDE CD drive. After changing the CD, the guest OS either refuses to read it or reads bad data. However, after a system_reset, they read the disc fine. This suggests that the issue isn't hardware-related but rather how QEMU handles CD changes.

Looking at the possible categories: It's not a mistranslation because that involves user-mode assembly or IR mapping. Assembly lowering is also unlikely. Other possibilities include device, graphic, socket, etc., but the main issue here is with CD drive handling, which relates to peripherals.

The problem seems specific to how QEMU emulates IDE drives and handles CD changes, which falls under the 'peripherals' category since it's about hardware emulation devices.
