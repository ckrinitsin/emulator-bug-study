Okay, I'm looking at this bug report about QEMU where images used as SCSI disks aren't being read properly on macOS 10.8 using qemu-system-arm. The user provided details about their setup and the commit that introduced the issue.

First, I need to figure out which category this falls into from the given list: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is about SCSI disks not being readable. Since it's related to storage devices and their interaction with QEMU, which emulates hardware, the likely category would be 'peripherals'. This makes sense because SCSI support in QEMU involves handling device emulation, which falls under the peripherals category.
