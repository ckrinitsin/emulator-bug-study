Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report about QEMU. The user is experiencing excessive memory allocation on both the guest and host when GPU passthrough is enabled. They mention that even though the guest only has 8 GB allocated, the host allocates up to 64 GB.

First, I'll look at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is related to GPU passthrough, which typically involves hardware devices and their resource allocation. Since it's about memory being allocated in excess when a physical GPU is passed through, this seems to involve how the host handles device resources for the guest. The problem occurs during VM setup with GPU passthrough, so it's likely tied to how QEMU manages such hardware.

Looking at the categories, 'device' and 'peripherals' seem relevant because they pertain to hardware devices attached to the VM. However, 'device' is a more general category, while 'peripherals' might be more specific to input/output devices like GPUs. But in this context, since it's about GPU passthrough causing excessive memory allocation, I think 'peripheral' would fit as it relates directly to the hardware device being passed through.

Alternatively, could it be 'hypervisor'? Since QEMU is a hypervisor (or part of it), but the issue is more about device management rather than the hypervisor itself. So maybe 'peripherals' is better because it's about how the GPU and memory are handled when devices are assigned to guests.

So, I'll go with 'peripherals' as the category.

The bug report describes an issue where enabling GPU passthrough causes excessive memory allocation on both the host and guest systems. The problem arises specifically when the GPU is passed through to a virtual machine, leading to higher memory usage than intended. This relates to how hardware devices, particularly GPUs, are managed in QEMU. Since the issue pertains to device resource allocation, the most fitting category is 'peripherals'.

**Answer:** peripherals
