Okay, let's try to figure out what category this bug report falls into. The user is having trouble installing Windows 7 32-bit on QEMU using the Q35 machine type. They mentioned that the keyboard and mouse don't work, so they can't proceed with the installation. 

First, I'll recall the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals.

The main issue here is that the mouse and keyboard aren't functioning during the installation. Since this happens with Q35 but works with i440FX, it's likely related to how the hardware is emulated in each machine type. The user also mentioned they can see the cursor when using i440FX, so it must be a problem specific to the Q35 setup.

Looking at the categories, "peripherals" seems relevant because the keyboard and mouse are input devices, which fall under peripherals. The issue might be with how the Q35 machine type handles USB or PS/2 devices compared to i440FX. Maybe the input drivers aren't being properly configured in Q35 mode.

I don't think it's a "boot" issue because the system does boot; it just can't interact with the installer. It's also not about the graphical display directly since the cursor doesn't appear, but that might be a symptom of the peripherals not working rather than a graphics problem itself.

So, considering all this, I believe the category should be "peripherals" because the issue is related to input devices not functioning correctly in a specific machine type configuration.

The bug report describes an issue where the keyboard and mouse do not function during the installation of Windows 7 when using the Q35 machine type. This suggests that there's a problem with how the input devices are handled under QEMU's Q35 setup compared to i440FX. Since the issue is related to hardware emulation, particularly concerning peripherals (keyboard and mouse), the appropriate category is:
