Okay, so I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU into one of the given categories. Let's start by reading through the problem carefully.

The user is having trouble with USB not working in their QEMU setup. They're using Debian Lenny and Squeeze, and they've installed qemu-kvm version 0.12.5 from the repository. They tried upgrading to the latest stable version, 0.13.0, hoping it would fix the issue, but it didn't help.

Looking at the command line, they're using `-usbdevice host:002.007`. The error message they receive is "usb_create: no bus specified, using 'usb.0' for 'usb-host'". They also provided a link to another discussion which might be relevant but it's behind an email address.

The guest OS is Debian Lenny with a 2.6.26 kernel. Additionally, the user attempted to download the development version via git clone but faced an interruption due to network issues, leading to an incomplete download.

Now, considering the categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and others.

The issue is clearly related to USB functionality within QEMU. Since USB devices are considered peripheral hardware, this would fall under the 'peripherals' category. The error message suggests a problem with how the USB device is being passed to the guest, which is a typical issue in handling peripherals.
