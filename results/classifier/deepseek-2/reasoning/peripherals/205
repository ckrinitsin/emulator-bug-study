Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "Arrow keys press is double in some programs in Dos." The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about arrow keys being pressed twice in some DOS programs. This sounds like an input problem, specifically with keyboard handling. Since it's related to hardware interaction and how the system processes key presses, I think it falls under "peripherals." Peripherals often involve devices like keyboards and their drivers. It might not be a translation issue or performance-related; more likely, there's an issue in how the hypervisor (like QEMU) handles keyboard input for DOS programs.
