Okay, so I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The user mentions that the Turkish (tr) keyboard isn't working after a specific version of QEMU, v20171217. They tried different images like FreeDOS, WinPE, and Linux, but none work with the Turkish keyboard layout. Specifically, pressing certain keys results in incorrect characters being displayed. For example, pressing "รง" shows ",", and pressing "." shows "รง". The user notes that the keyboard always defaults to "en-us", which isn't desired.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about a keyboard not functioning correctly in QEMU. Since it's related to input devices and specifically the keyboard layout mapping, this seems like a problem with how the keyboard device is handled. Therefore, the category should be 'peripherals' because it's dealing with hardware input devices within the virtual machine environment.
