Okay, so I need to figure out which category this bug report falls into from the given options. Let's read through the problem description carefully.

The user is experiencing an issue where their mouse pointer doesn't move when using USB pass-through in QEMU. They mention that the mouse works because hot corners trigger menu items, but the cursor remains stationary. The keyboard and Xbox controller are working fine, so it's specifically a problem with the mouse's cursor movement.

They provided steps to reproduce: using a script with correct USB IDs for the mouse and keyboard. After booting the VM, the cursor doesn't move, even though other devices work. They also noted they're applying certain patches in QEMU and running specific kernel versions. Both QEMU 10.0-rc1 and 9.2.2 have this issue.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and others like mistranslation or assembly lowering.

The problem is about USB pass-through for a mouse. Since it's related to USB devices not functioning correctly in the VM, it likely falls under 'peripherals'. Alternatively, if it's a device that connects through the host's USB but isn't being recognized properly by QEMU or the kernel, maybe 'device' could be considered.

But more specifically, the issue is with the pointer movement not registering, which is related to input handling. USB pass-through for devices like mice and keyboards falls under 'peripherals'. The fact that other devices work suggests it's an isolated issue in how the mouse is being handled in the VM's peripherals setup.

So I think the correct category here would be 'peripherals'.

The bug report describes an issue where the mouse pointer doesn't move when using USB pass-through in QEMU. The problem is specific to the mouse cursor not moving, despite the mouse functioning otherwise (e.g., triggering hot corners). Since this pertains to input devices and their functionality within the virtual machine environment, it falls under the 'peripherals' category.

**Answer: peripherals**
