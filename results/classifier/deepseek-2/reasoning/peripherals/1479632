Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned issues with QEMU crashing when using sound and sometimes the program hangs without mouse input. They provided their command line which includes `-soundhw all`, so sound is definitely part of the setup.

Looking at the categories given: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The main issue here seems to be with sound not working and causing crashes. Since it's related to hardware emulation, especially the sound hardware, I think 'peripherals' would be the appropriate category. Sound is a peripheral device, so problems here likely fall under that.
