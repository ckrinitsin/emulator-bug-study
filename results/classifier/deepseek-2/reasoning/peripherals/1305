Okay, I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user described an issue where after migrating a VM using usbredir, the USB drive letter changes because the device is unplugged and re-plugged. They mentioned that the device state isn't maintained post-migration and referenced another bug about chardev reconnection.

Looking at the categories: The problem involves USB devices in the VM and their behavior during migration. Since USB redirection (usbredir) is a feature related to peripherals, this falls under the 'peripherals' category. It's not a translation issue or performance-related but rather an interaction with hardware devices.
