Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "Broken mouse movement inside MS-DOS for at least one program". The possible categories are listed as mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the bug is about mouse movement issues within an MS-DOS environment when running a program. Since it's related to QEMU, which emulates hardware devices, I should think about what part of QEMU handles mouse input.

The mouse is a hardware peripheral, so any issue with its functionality would fall under the 'peripherals' category. It doesn't seem to be a translation or assembly problem, nor does it relate directly to networking, VNC, or KVM. So 'peripherals' makes sense here.

The bug report involves an issue with mouse movement within MS-DOS, which is related to hardware emulation. Since the mouse is a peripheral device, the appropriate category is peripherals.

**Answer:** peripherals
