Alright, let's analyze this bug report. The user is experiencing issues where the keyboard and mouse aren't working after booting into their distro in QEMU. They mention that other distributions like Porteus and Tinycore work fine, so it's not a general issue with all distros.

The problem occurs when using both VNC and SDL as display types, which suggests it might be related to how the input is handled by QEMU itself rather than the display type. They're also using a portable version of QEMU but encountered the same issue with the repository version, indicating it's likely not an installation-specific problem.

The key point here is that input devices (mouse and keyboard) stop working after booting into the desktop. Since the clock runs and shutdown works correctly via the menu, the VM isn't frozen; it's just not accepting input. This points towards a configuration or driver issue within QEMU related to handling peripherals during the guest OS's runtime.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The failure is specifically with input devices not being recognized after boot. This seems to be related to how QEMU handles the mouse and keyboard in the guest OS, which falls under peripherals.
