Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "[feature request] webcam support". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the title says it's a feature request, so it might not be a bug. But I'm supposed to classify based on the content.

Webcam support usually relates to hardware devices. In QEMU, webcam would fall under device emulation or peripheral devices because it involves handling input/output devices in the virtual machine.

Looking at the categories, 'device' and 'peripherals' are options. 'Device' is broader, while 'peripherals' might be more specific to things like USB devices. Since a webcam could be considered a peripheral device, but sometimes categorized under general devices too.

But wait, I think in QEMU terminology, peripherals often refer to input devices, which includes webcams. So maybe it's better to categorize as 'peripherals'.

The feature request is about adding webcam support, which typically involves handling hardware devices or peripherals in a virtual environment. 

Answer: peripherals
