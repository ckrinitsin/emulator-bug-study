Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is about PCI devices on PCI to PCI bridges not being accessible from Xen when using QEMU 2.3.0 or later. The change involved adding calls to xen_map_pcidev() at startup but not when the guest configures the bridge. This affects Xen 4.5.0 users with QEMU 2.3.0+.

The main issue is related to how PCI devices are handled, specifically in the context of Xen and QEMU interaction. Since it's about device accessibility through a bridge, which is part of hardware peripheral management, the category should be 'peripherals'. Alternatively, 'device' could also fit, but 'peripherals' seems more specific here as it deals with device access via bridges.

The bug report discusses an issue with PCI devices and their accessibility in Xen using QEMU 2.3.0+. The problem arises from the way calls to xen_map_pcidev() are handled at startup versus when the guest configures the bridge. Since this involves the management of hardware devices, particularly through bridges, it falls under 'peripherals'.

**Answer:** peripherals
