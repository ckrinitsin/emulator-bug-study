Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report related to QEMU. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is reporting an issue where running `./configure --help` in a read-only directory causes the configure script to enter an infinite loop and print nonsense messages. Specifically, they extracted the source as one user and tried to run configure as another user. Normally, autoconf scripts handle this without issues, but QEMU's does not.

Looking at the error messages, it seems like the script is trying to create a 'build' directory but doesn't have permission. It keeps looping because of this failure. The key points are permissions and directory access.

Now, I need to categorize this bug from the given options: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem is related to running the script in a read-only directory and permission issues when trying to create directories or files. This falls under permissions because it's about file system access rights.

I don't think it's 'other' because there's a specific category that fitsâ€”permissions. The issue isn't with translation, assembly, or any of the other listed categories like network or hypervisor. It's purely an access control problem during the build setup.
