Okay, so I have to classify this bug report: "9.2.0 tarball contains unrelated files". The categories available are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the issue is about a tarball containing unrelated files. A tarball is an archive file created from a Unix filesystem. So this seems related to how files are packaged or included in the distribution. 

Looking at the categories, "files" might be relevant because it's talking about files within the package. Alternatively, "permissions" could come into play if there's an issue with access rights to those files, but that doesn't seem directly applicable here.

The problem isn't related to translation errors (mistranslation), assembly code, performance issues, or any of the hypervisor-specific aspects like KVM or peripherals. It's more about the contents of the distribution package being incorrect.

So "files" seems like the most appropriate category because it's about the files included in the tarball and ensuring they're correct.
