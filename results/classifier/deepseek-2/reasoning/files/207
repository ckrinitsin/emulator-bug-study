Okay, I'm looking at this bug report where someone suggests moving a script from ./scripts/qmp to ./python/qemu/qmp. The task is to classify this under one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

First, I need to understand what the bug report is about. The user is proposing a file move. This seems related to the structure or organization of the project's directories rather than any functional aspect of QEMU itself. Since it's about moving files, it falls under filesystem management.

Looking at the categories provided, 'files' would be the most appropriate because it's dealing with how files are organized within the project. Other categories like 'network' or 'graphic' don't apply here since there's no mention of networking issues or graphical problems. Similarly, 'KVM', 'boot', etc., aren't relevant to moving a script.

Therefore, the correct classification for this bug report is under 'files'.

The user is suggesting a file organization change within the QEMU project, specifically moving a script from one directory to another. This pertains to how files are managed and structured in the project, not to any functional issue or feature related to QEMU's operation.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Bug Report Content:** The report is about moving a script file within the project structure.
2. **Determine Relevant Categories:** Since it involves file relocation, 'files' is the appropriate category.
3. **Exclude Other Categories:** No functional aspect like networking or graphics is mentioned.

**Answer:**
files
