Okay, so I'm trying to help classify this bug report for QEMU. Let's see what the issue is here.

The user mentioned that they're compiling a kernel under virtfs and getting an error. The same compilation works outside of virtfs. Both the guest and host are running 3.0.4 kernels, and QEMU is the latest version from git. 

Looking at the provided QEMU command line, I see options related to VirtIO devices like -drive with if=virtio, and the -net options also using VirtIO models. The fstab entry uses trans=virtio for virtfs.

The problem occurs when they run 'make' after making defconfig. They get an error during configuration update, specifically about a missing rule for include/config/auto.conf. 

Now, considering the categories: it's related to compiling under virtfs, which is a filesystem used for sharing directories between host and guest in QEMU. The issue seems to be with how the kernel is being built within this environment, possibly due to file permissions or setup issues when using VirtFS.

Looking at the possible categories like 'files' or 'permissions', I think it's more about the way files are accessed under virtfs. Since the problem occurs only when compiling inside virtfs, it could be a permission issue specific to that mount point.

So, the category should probably be 'files' because it relates to file access within the VirtFS mount.
