Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The bug report says "qemu-img: support ZSTD compression level customization." 

First, I should understand what qemu-img does. QEMU is a machine emulator and virtualization tool, and qemu-img is part of it used for handling disk images. This feature request is about adding support to customize the ZSTD compression level in qemu-img.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and other. 

I need to see which category fits best. The feature is about compression level for ZSTD in qemu-img, which relates to how images are handled. Since it's about file operations or image management, "files" might be a possible category. Alternatively, since compression affects performance, maybe "performance," but that's less direct.

Wait, let me think again. The main functionality here is related to image handling and compression settings, so it's more about the files aspect rather than pure performance optimization. Therefore, I'll classify it under "files."
