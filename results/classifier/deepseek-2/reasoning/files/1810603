Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU based on the given categories. The user provided a detailed issue where QCow images are growing dramatically after migrating from VirtualBox to QEMU using KVM and libvirt. They noticed that all disks filled up, which shouldn't happen because they're reverting VMs every hour.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The problem is about QCow images growing unexpectedly despite regular reverts. This seems related to how snapshots or linked clones are handled in QEMU. Since they're using KVM and libvirt, the issue might be with the way QEMU manages these disk images over time.

I recall that QCow2 images can sometimes have issues with snapshot management leading to unexpected growth, especially when reverting. Maybe there's a bug where the snapshots aren't being properly cleaned up or merged, causing the base image to grow each time. This would fall under how QEMU handles storage or disk images, which relates to file operations.

The mention of linked clones and snapshots suggests it's a problem with how QEMU manages these in terms of file handling, possibly within the 'files' category as it pertains to storage management.

The bug report describes an issue where QCow images are growing unexpectedly despite reverting VMs. This relates to how QEMU handles disk files, specifically linked clones and snapshots.

**file**

The problem is categorized under 'files' because it involves issues with the handling and growth of disk image files in QEMU.
