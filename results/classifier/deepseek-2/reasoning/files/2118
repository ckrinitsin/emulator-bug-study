Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report: "make vm-build-openbsd reinstalls OpenBSD every time." The user wants me to categorize it into one of several predefined categories.

First, let's understand the bug. It says that when using `make vm-build-openbsd`, it causes OpenBSD to be reinstalled each time. So, every time you run this command, it's reinstalling the OS on the VM.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

I need to figure out which category this issue falls into. The bug is about the build process reinstalling OpenBSD every time, which relates to how the VM is being built or configured. It's not directly related to assembly translation or user-mode issues (so not 'mistranslation'). It doesn't seem like an assembly lowering problem either.

The command in question is `make vm-build-openbsd`, which suggests it's part of building a VM image. So, the issue might be with how the build process handles OpenBSD installation. If it always re-installs, maybe there's an issue with caching or whether the necessary files are already present.

Looking at the categories again: 'boot' relates to starting up the system, but this isn't about booting; it's about building the VM. 'files' could be related if it's a problem with file handling during the build process. Maybe the script doesn't check if OpenBSD is already installed and proceeds to reinstall it unnecessarily.

Alternatively, 'kernel' or 'hypervisor' might not fit because the issue is more about the build process rather than the kernel or hypervisor functionality itself. 'KVM' is a specific hypervisor, but the bug report doesn't specify that it's KVM-related.

So, considering all this, the problem seems to be related to how files are handled during the build processâ€”specifically, whether existing installations are detected and skipped. Therefore, the most appropriate category would likely be 'files' because it's about file operations or state during the make command execution.
