Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report: "readlink(2) returns incorrect size for /proc/self/exe". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, I need to understand what the bug is about. Readlink is a system call in Linux that reads symbolic link information. It's used here on /proc/self/exe, which is a special file pointing to the current executable. The issue is that it returns an incorrect size. So, when someone calls readlink("/proc/self/exe", buffer, sizeof(buffer), ...), they get a wrong size value.

Now, looking at QEMU components, I know that /proc is handled by the procfs filesystem. In QEMU, this might be emulated or part of the guest OS's view. The problem seems related to how the file sizes are reported in the procfs.

The categories given: files could relate to handling of files and their metadata. Permissions might involve access rights, but here it's about size, not permissions. Kernel would be low-level system calls, but files is more specific to file operations.

Other options like network or socket don't seem relevant here since readlink is about file systems. So, the most fitting category seems to be 'files' because it's related to how file sizes are reported in the file system.

The bug relates to incorrect size reporting for a file, which falls under the files category.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Bug:** The issue is with readlink(2) returning an incorrect size for /proc/self/exe.
2. **Understand Components Involved:** Readlink interacts with the file system, specifically procfs in this case.
3. **Categorize the Issue:** Since it's about file size reporting, the appropriate category is 'files'.
4. **Eliminate Other Options:** It's not a network, socket, or permission issue.

**Answer:**

files
