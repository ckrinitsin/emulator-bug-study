Alright, so I need to classify this bug report about renaming snapshots in QEMU. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user mentioned using `qemu-img snapshot -c` to create a snapshot and now wants to rename it. They're pointing out that they don't know how to do this and think it's a useful feature. So, the issue is about the lack of functionality to rename snapshots created via QEMU's image tool.

Looking at the possible categories: I need to figure out which one fits best. The options are mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user's issue isn't about translation errors or assembly code. It's not directly related to hardware devices like graphics or networking. They're talking about snapshots created by `qemu-img`, which deals with disk images. So maybe it's related to 'files' since snapshots are image files. Alternatively, it could be under 'other' because it's a feature request rather than a bug per se.

But considering that the user is reporting a missing function in QEMU's img tool, which manages disk images, I think 'files' makes sense as the category. It relates to handling and managing file operations within QEMU.
