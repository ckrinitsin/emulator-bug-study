Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is talking about an RFE (Request for Enhancement) related to SMBIOS tables in QEMU. They mention populating "OEM Strings" which are part of type 11 SMBIOS tables. The feature allows specifying up to 255 strings, each of arbitrary length, and these can be exposed by libvirt.

They point out that currently, users can only specify these strings via the QEMU command line, which is limiting because it restricts the amount of data that can be passed. The user wants to allow passing data from regular files instead.

Looking at how they suggest using it: "$QEMU -smbios type=11,value=Hello,txtfile=file1.txt,txtfile=file2.txt", where the files contain ASCII prefixes and base64-encoded binary data.

So, this is about enhancing QEMU's SMBIOS handling to allow reading strings from files. The current category list includes options like "mistranslation," "assembly," "other," etc. I need to see which fits best.

The feature isn't a translation issue or related to assembly lowering. It's more about how user input is handled for SMBIOS configuration. Since they want to read from regular files, it's about file handling. The category "files" seems appropriate because the change involves reading data from files rather than just command-line arguments.

Other categories like "network" or "graphic" don't apply here. It's specifically about accessing and using files for SMBIOS strings.

The bug report is about allowing QEMU to read strings from regular files for populating the SMBIOS table, which relates to file handling.
