Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "Add Illumnos VM image." Let's go through each category.

First, looking at the options: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The task is to add an Illumos VM image. Illumos is a Unix-like operating system, and creating or adding a VM image typically involves setting up the environment for the guest OS within QEMU/KVM. Since this is about adding a specific VM image, it's not directly related to things like translation errors (mistranslation), assembly issues, networking, graphics, etc.

Illumos isn't a hardware device or a peripheral. It doesn't fall under KVM as a hypervisor specifically unless the bug is about enabling KVM for Illumos, but here it's more about adding an image, which is a file-based operation.

Considering that, "files" seems like the best fit because it involves handling VM images, which are files in the filesystem. So, the category should be "files."

The bug report is about adding a VM image, which relates to file operations within QEMU.
