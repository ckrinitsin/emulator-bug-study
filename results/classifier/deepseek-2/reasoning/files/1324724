Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's see what the problem is.

The user ran the commands:

./configure --target-list=arm-softmmu
make
sudo make install

And during installation, it failed with an error when trying to strip some files. The specific error was about '/usr/local/bin/fsdev/virtfs-proxy-helper' not existing. So the strip command is failing because that file doesn't exist.

Looking at the categories provided:

- mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue seems to be related to the installation process. The problem occurs during 'make install', which is part of building and installing QEMU. The error message mentions that a specific file isn't found when trying to strip it. 

Strip is usually used for stripping debug symbols from binaries. So, in this case, the makefile is attempting to strip several files but one of them doesn't exist, causing the installation to fail.

Looking at the categories, 'files' seems relevant because it's about the presence or absence of certain files during the build/install process. Alternatively, 'other' could be a possibility if none of the specific categories fit.

But since the issue is specifically about a missing file that should be present (as part of the install process), it's more likely related to how files are being handled during installation, which falls under 'files'.

The bug report involves an error during the installation step where a file expected by the strip command doesn't exist. This points to an issue with file handling or presence during the build/installation phase.
