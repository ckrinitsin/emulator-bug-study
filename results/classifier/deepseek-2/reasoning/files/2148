Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report from QEMU. Let's see what the problem is.

The user mentioned that "vdso.so" is required to build and that it was working in 8.1.4 but not in 8.2.0 after removing binaries from the source distribution. So when they removed vdso.so, the build failed because the file wasn't found.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue here is about a missing binary file during compilation. It's not related to translation issues or assembly lowering. It seems like the build process depends on this file being present, which isn't there anymore after removal. The error message points to a missing file in the build process, so it's more about how the files are handled.

So, the problem is that a necessary file is missing when building, causing a failure. This falls under the "files" category because it's an issue with the presence or absence of required files during compilation.

The bug report involves a missing binary file (vdso.so) which is needed for the build process to work correctly. The error occurs during the build step, indicating that the build relies on this file being present but it has been removed.
