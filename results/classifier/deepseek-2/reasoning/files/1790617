Alright, let's figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user mentioned that when they use the `qemu-img info` command, it doesn't display the version of the disk image format. They tried using both raw and qcow2 formats, but in one case, there was an error message indicating a problem with the command syntax.

First, looking at the error output from running `qemu-img info qcow2 [image-file-name.img]`, it says "Expecting one image file name." That suggests that the command might be expecting only one argument. So when they included 'qcow2' as an option, perhaps that's causing confusion. Maybe the way they're specifying the format is incorrect.

Wait, I remember that `qemu-img info` can take a format option, but maybe it's not being used correctly here. For example, using `-f` to specify the format. So if they run `qemu-img info -f raw [image.img]`, that should work. But when they tried just `qemu-img info qcow2 [image.qcow2]`, perhaps that's causing an issue because it's expecting only one argument after info.

But in their steps, they mention running commands like 'qemu-img info -f qcow2 [image]', which should be correct. However, when they omit the `-f` and just use `qemu-img info qcow2 [image]`, that might not work because the command is expecting only one file name, not the format as an argument.

So the bug seems to be related to how `qemu-img info` handles the format specification. The user expects it to display the version of the image format (like raw or qcow2), but in some cases, it's throwing an error because they're providing extra arguments.

Looking at the categories provided: network, device, performance, etc. This issue is about how `qemu-img` reports information about disk images. It's related to file handling and format detection, which falls under the 'files' category. Since it's about the functionality of a command that deals with image files and their metadata, 'files' seems appropriate.

I don't think it's a network issue because there's no mention of networking. Similarly, it's not about graphics or devices; it's purely about file operations. The problem arises when interacting with disk images, so 'files' fits best.
