Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem is about a file being embedded twice in the documentation. Specifically, `qemu-block-drivers.rst.inc` is included in two different .rst files: `docs/system/qemu-block-drivers.rst` and `docs/system/images.rst`. This duplication causes the same content to appear on two separate web pages, which might confuse users. Additionally, it's causing issues with the sphinx search index because the same object is pointing to different places randomly during build time.

Now, looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

This bug isn't related to any of the usual suspects like device drivers or networking; it's more about documentation structure and build processes. The issue is that a file is included twice in the documentation, leading to duplication and search index problems.

The categories don't have anything specific for documentation issues. So I should look for the most appropriate category. 'files' seems relevant because the problem is about how files are being included or managed. Alternatively, it could fall under 'other' since it's not fitting neatly into any of the other predefined categories related to system components.

But considering that the bug is about file inclusion and duplication leading to build-time issues, 'files' might be more precise than 'other'. So I'll go with 'files'.
