Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The user is reporting that on the QEMU website, specifically under the Windows installer sections for x86 and x64 platforms, there's no available installer for version 7.2.0. Instead, only the RC4 build from December 8, 2022, is present. So, the issue is about missing files in the repository.

Looking at the categories, "files" seems to fit because it's related to the availability of specific file types (installers) on the website. Other possible categories like network or kernel don't apply here since it's not a performance issue or related to hardware/peripherals. It's more about the absence of required files for users to download and install QEMU.
