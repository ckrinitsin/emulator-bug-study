Alright, let's see. The user reported an issue with QEMU not shutting down when VNC is enabled on OS X. They can normally terminate the process with ctrl-c without VNC, but when VNC is active, ctrl-c doesn't work, and they have to use Activity Monitor or another method.

So, first, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is related to VNC because it's specifically when VNC is enabled that QEMU doesn't shut down properly. The user tried using ctrl-c and found it ineffective, which suggests that the termination signal isn't being handled correctly when VNC is active.

Looking at the categories, "vnc" seems directly relevant here since the problem occurs only when VNC is used. There's no mention of other components like graphics drivers or device issues; it's specifically about the VNC connection preventing proper shutdown.

I don't think it falls under 'other' because there's a specific feature (VNC) involved that's causing the issue. It doesn't seem related to assembly, kernel, or hypervisor problems either.

Therefore, the appropriate category for this bug report is "vnc".
