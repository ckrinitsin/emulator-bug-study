Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user provided some categories, and I need to pick just one based on the description.

The issue is about a black screen when installing Windows XP using VNC in QEMU. It used to work fine before version 9.1.0 but started happening after that. So the problem is related to the graphical display during installation via VNC.

Looking at the categories, I see 'vnc' is one of them. The bug affects the visual output over VNC, so it's definitely tied to how VNC is handled in QEMU. Other possibilities like graphics or device might be relevant, but since VNC is mentioned explicitly, that's the primary category here.

I don't think it's a kernel issue or hypervisor because the problem occurs during display through VNC, not with system calls or virtualization layers themselves. It's more about how the graphical output is being sent over the network via VNC protocol, which points directly to the 'vnc' category.
