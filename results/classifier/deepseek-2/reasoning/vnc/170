Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The request is about adding a log message for the built-in VNC server when authentication fails, like an "Auth failed from IP" message.

First, looking at the list of possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is about logging authentication failures in the VNC server. So it's related to the VNC component of QEMU. The user wants a log report when auth fails, which would help in debugging or monitoring connections.

I think "vnc" is the most appropriate category here because it's directly related to the VNC server functionality. Adding logs pertains to its operation and security aspects. It doesn't fall under debug because it's more about enhancing logging rather than fixing a bug in the debug output itself. It's not about network, socket, or other low-level components specifically but the VNC feature as a whole.
