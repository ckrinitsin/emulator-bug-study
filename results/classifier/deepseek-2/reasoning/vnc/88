Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "VNC server does not work with Mac Screen Sharing." The possible categories are quite specific, so I should go through them one by one.

First, VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is related to remote desktop services. The user mentioned that the VNC server isn't working with Mac's Screen Sharing feature. Since QEMU includes a VNC server for remote display purposes, this issue falls under its functionality.

Looking at the categories: 'vnc' is one of them. That seems like the most direct fit because it's about the VNC server not interacting correctly with another client (Mac's Screen Sharing). Other categories like network or graphic could be related, but they are broader and don't pinpoint the issue as accurately as 'vnc'.

I should make sure none of the other categories better fit. The problem isn't with device drivers, permissions, performance, or any specific kernel part. It's specifically about how the VNC server interacts (or doesn't) with another screen-sharing tool. So 'vnc' is definitely the right category.
