Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the provided categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user's issue is about typing via VNC being unreliable. They mentioned that sometimes keys are skipped, swapped, or repeated. This problem doesn't occur when using VNC on physical hardware.

Looking at the categories, the main keyword here is "VNC." The bug report specifically points out issues with the VNC connection in QEMU. Therefore, it's directly related to the VNC component.

So, the category should be 'vnc' because the problem occurs during input via the VNC protocol.
