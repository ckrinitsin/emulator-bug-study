Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The user is reporting an issue with QEMU 2.11 where they can't type certain characters via VNC: '<', '>', and '|'. They mention that these keys work fine on their en_US QWERTY keyboard when not using VNC, specifically in other environments. The same problem occurs with two different ISO images. However, the issue doesn't happen when VNC isn't used.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem is related to input not being captured correctly through VNC. Since it's a keyboard issue over VNC, the most relevant category seems to be 'vnc'. It's not about translation errors or assembly issues but rather how the input is handled in the VNC session.
