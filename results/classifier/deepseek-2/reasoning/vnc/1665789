Alright, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user is asking about adding more resolutions for VGA displays accessed via VNC instead of SPICE. They specifically mentioned two resolutions: 1080x1920 and a split screen setup.

First, looking at the possible categories, I see "vnc" as an option. Since the report mentions accessing VGA through VNC, that seems relevant. The other category related might be "graphic" or maybe "display", but in the list provided, it's under "vnc". 

The user isn't talking about performance issues, permissions, or network configuration directly. It's more about display settings and resolution options within the VNC environment. Therefore, the most appropriate category is likely "vnc".
