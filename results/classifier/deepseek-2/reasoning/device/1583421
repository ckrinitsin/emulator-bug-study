Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user is asking for an option to print the default hardware configuration as command-line options. They mention using -nodefaults and manually specifying devices. They want documentation of these defaults in terms of CLI options, possibly with a new command-line option to output this info for specific machines.

Looking at the categories, it's about how QEMU handles the setup of hardware when starting without defaults. The user wants more control over or clarity on what default hardware is being used. This seems related to device configuration rather than something like network settings or performance issues.

So, the main point here is about hardware devices and their configurations in QEMU. Therefore, it falls under 'device'.

The bug report concerns the need for documentation of default hardware configurations as command-line options, making it easier to use -nodefaults by allowing users to see and edit these defaults. This relates to how QEMU configures devices by default when running without the -nodefaults option. The user wants a way to output the default hardware setup in terms of CLI arguments for different machines.

Since this is about the configuration and listing of hardware devices, it falls under the 'device' category.
