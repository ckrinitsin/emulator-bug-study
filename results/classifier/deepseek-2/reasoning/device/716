Alright, let me try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user mentioned using the "-device scsi-cd" option on an arm64 platform and that the virtual disk isn't being recognized. They're asking if "scsi-cd" is fully adapted for arm64.

Looking at the possible categories, I see device as one of them. Since they're talking about a specific device type ("scsi-cd") not working correctly on a particular architecture (arm64), it's likely related to device support or compatibility in QEMU/KVM. There's no mention of translation issues, assembly lowering, or other common bug types, so the most fitting category here is "device."
