Alright, let's figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is experiencing an issue where QEMU 5.1 no longer shows error messages related to inaccessible USB devices that were present in version 5.0.0.

First, the user ran a specific command with several devices attached, like usb-host and intel-hda. In QEMU 5.0.0, they received libusb errors about permission denied when trying to access /dev/bus/usb/002/004. But in version 5.1.0, these error messages don't appear anymore.

The user performed a git bisect and found that the first bad commit was by Gerd Hoffmann. The commit message mentions adding a 'hostdevice' property to usb-host devices using qemu_open(). It also notes that this requires libusb 1.0.23 or newer.

Looking at the changes, it seems that the way USB host devices are handled has been modified. Previously, QEMU might have been relying on libusb for device access and reporting errors directly. Now, with the new property, it's using qemu_open(), which might handle file descriptors differently and perhaps suppresses certain error messages.

The bug is about missing error messages when there's a permission issue accessing USB devices. The category options include 'device', which makes sense because the problem is related to handling USB host devices. Other categories like 'network' or 'graphic' don't apply here since it's specifically about USB access permissions.

So, the classification should be 'device' as it pertains to how QEMU manages USB devices and their respective error reporting.

The bug report involves changes in how QEMU handles USB host device access after a specific commit. The issue is related to the handling of USB devices and the disappearance of error messages when permissions are insufficient. Since the problem revolves around USB devices and their management, the appropriate category is:

device
</category>

**Answer:**
