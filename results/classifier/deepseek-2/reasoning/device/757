Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report about "intel-hda: stream reset bits are broken." Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the component mentioned is intel-hda, which stands for Intel High Definition Audio. That's related to audio processing in QEMU. Now, the issue is with "stream reset bits being broken." Reset bits usually refer to specific fields or flags used in hardware communication to reset certain functionalities.

In QEMU, components like audio would fall under peripherals because they're emulating hardware devices. So, this bug is about how the HDA device is handled, specifically regarding stream resets which are part of its functionality.

Looking at the possible categories: device makes sense here since it's about a specific hardware component being emulated incorrectly. Other options like graphic or network don't fit because they're unrelated to audio. KVM is related to virtualization but not directly the issue here. The bug isn't about performance, permissions, or user-mode translation; it's specifically about how the HDA device's stream reset functionality works.

So, I think "device" is the right category for this bug report.

The bug report pertains to a specific hardware component (Intel HD Audio) and its functionality related to stream resets. Since it's about an emulated device in QEMU, the appropriate category is:

**device**
