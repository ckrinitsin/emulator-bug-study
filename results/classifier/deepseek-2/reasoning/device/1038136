Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned it's part of QEMU and provided possible categories. 

The problem described is about a missing keycode (89) for br-abnt2 keyboards in QEMU-KVM. So, when someone presses that key, nothing happens. But when they use the "-k pt-br" option, other keycodes like 26 and 51 don't work properly either.

I'm thinking about what categories fit this issue. The user is experiencing problems with specific keyboard keys not working correctly under QEMU. This seems related to how the virtual machine handles input devices, specifically the keyboard mapping.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. Device makes sense because it's about a hardware device (the keyboard) not functioning as expected in the VM. The other options like graphic or network don't seem to apply here since it's an input issue.

So, I think the correct category for this bug is "device."

The bug report deals with incorrect handling of specific keycodes related to the br-abnt2 keyboard layout under QEMU-KVM. This pertains to how the virtual machine handles input devices, specifically the keyboard mapping and translation. Therefore, it falls under:

**device**

Answer: device
