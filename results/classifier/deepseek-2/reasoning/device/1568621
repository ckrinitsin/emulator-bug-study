Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. The issue is that the input-linux.c code is misdetecting a Logitech K350 keyboard as a mouse. From the user's description, it seems like the problem lies in how the device type is being detected.

The bug is specifically mentioned to be in the `input_linux_complete` function, which uses the evtmap value from the evdev device to determine the device type. The evtmap here is 0x0012001F, which sets the EV_REL bit. It looks like this causes the keyboard to be treated as a mouse.

Looking at the categories provided: assembly, device, graphic, etc., I need to find the most appropriate one. Since the problem relates to how input devices are detected and handled in QEMU, particularly keyboards being misclassified as mice, the category should reflect that it's an issue with device detection or input handling.

The possible categories include 'device', which seems fitting because the bug is about incorrect device type identification. Other options like 'input' aren't listed, so 'device' would be the closest match. 

I think the primary issue here is in how devices are being detected and categorized within QEMU's input subsystem. Therefore, the correct category for this bug report should be 'device'.
