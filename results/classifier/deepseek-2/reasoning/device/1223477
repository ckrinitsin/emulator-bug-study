Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user is having trouble reading USB filesystems with EFI BIOS. They mention that in older versions of QEMU (1.2.2 and before), it worked fine when using OVMF, but starting from 1.3.0-rc0, it stopped working.

First, the issue is related to USB devices being recognized as the primary hard drive (-hda). The user tried different commands with both x86 and x86_64 versions of QEMU, and all showed the same problem: the EFI shell detects the block device but sees no files or directories. However, using an image file instead of a physical USB drive works fine, which suggests it's not a hardware issue but something in how QEMU handles the USB filesystem.

The user also tested various USB sizes without success. They rebuilt QEMU multiple times and noticed that only versions up to 1.2.2 worked. This implies there was a change between these versions that caused the problem.

Looking at possible categories:
- "mistranslation" might be about incorrect mapping from source to target, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.
- "device" seems relevant because it's related to USB devices not being handled properly.
- Other options like "graphic," "socket," or "network" don't seem to apply here.

Since the issue is specifically with USB filesystems and QEMU's handling of them, especially when using OVMF, the problem likely lies in how the device is being accessed or processed by the hypervisor. The fact that it worked before suggests a regression in QEMU's code related to device handling.

Therefore, the most appropriate category seems to be "device."
