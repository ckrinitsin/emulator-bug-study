Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let's see what the issue is.

The user says they can't use usb-host on Mac OS 10.15. They ran QEMU with certain arguments and got a bunch of libusb errors about another process having exclusive access and interfaces not found. Also, when starting, the drive ejects and remounts twice.

Looking at the error messages, it's all related to USB device handling. The key here is that the user tried to use usb-host in QEMU but faced issues with the USB interface on macOS. This likely involves how QEMU interacts with the host's USB devices, especially since macOS uses a different backend for libusb.

The categories provided include 'device', which seems relevant because it's about USB device interaction and hardware peripherals. Other options like 'network' or 'graphic' don't fit here. It's not related to the hypervisor itself but rather the handling of host devices.

So, the main issue is with the USB device support in QEMU on macOS, making 'device' the appropriate category.
