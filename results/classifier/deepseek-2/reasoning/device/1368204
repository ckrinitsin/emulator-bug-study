Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through the problem.

The user is reporting that when they run Windows Millennium Edition (WinME) in QEMU, the system isn't detecting the CD-ROM drive or additional hard drives automatically. They have to manually add an IDE controller driver via Device Manager for it to work. Normally, on real hardware, WinME should detect at least one IDE or SCSI controller.

Looking at the command line they used: it includes -hda (the primary IDE hard disk), -cdrom with a drivers.iso, and other options like soundhw and network settings. The QEMU version is 2.0.0.

The issue seems to be related to hardware detection within the virtual machine. Specifically, WinME isn't recognizing the CD-ROM or additional drives without manual driver installation. This points towards a problem with how QEMU presents the IDE controller to the guest OS.

Considering the categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. The problem is about hardware devices (IDE controller and CD-ROM drive) not being detected automatically. So it's related to how devices are emulated or presented in the VM.

The category 'device' seems appropriate because it's an issue with device detection and emulation within QEMU. Other categories like 'network' or 'graphic' don't fit here since the problem isn't about network connectivity or graphical issues.
