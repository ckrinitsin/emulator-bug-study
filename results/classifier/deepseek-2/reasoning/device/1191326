Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The user mentioned that QNX 4 doesn't boot on QEMU versions >=1.3. They tried both Windows and Linux hosts with the same issue.

Looking at the symptoms: when QNX tries to mount a partition, it gets an error saying "No bios signature in partition sector on /dev/hd0". This suggests something's wrong during the block device initialization or partition handling.

Possible categories include 'device', which covers hardware devices like disks. Since the problem occurs with the IDE driver and mounting partitions, it relates to how QEMU handles storage devices. Other categories like 'boot' or 'network' don't fit as well here because the issue isn't with booting in general or networking but with device recognition.

Therefore, this seems related to a block device or storage issue, so the category should be 'device'.
