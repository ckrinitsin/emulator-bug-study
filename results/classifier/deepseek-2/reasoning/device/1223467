Okay, so the user is reporting an issue where they can't use USB as hda in Windows with QEMU. They built QEMU 1.6.0 from source using MinGW and tried different command lines to run it, but it's giving them errors about the block protocol 'host_device' not supporting the option 'filename' and couldn't open the disk image.

They mentioned that this bug occurs in version 1.5 and 1.6 but not in 1.4. They also provided some analysis where they think the issue is in block.c, specifically around how it's handling the filename when using a USB device as hda on Windows.

From their debug output, it looks like QEMU is confused about whether it's dealing with a file or a physical drive. Their workaround was to modify line 860 of block.c to check if it's not a Windows drive before applying some condition. However, they're concerned this might mask other issues.

Looking at the possible categories: Mistranslation relates to incorrect mapping from source to target architecture, which doesn't seem directly relevant here since this is more about how QEMU handles block devices on Windows. Assembly lowering (assembly) is also not it. Other is a catch-all, but maybe 'device' or 'block' would be better, but those aren't listed.

Wait, the categories given are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue is about block devices and USB storage being recognized as hda, so 'device' seems more appropriate than others like network or graphics. Alternatively, 'block' isn't listed, but 'peripherals' might be a fit since it's related to hardware devices connected to the system.

Wait, the user mentions using USB as hda, which is a block device and part of the storage peripherals. So 'peripherals' seems fitting because it's about how QEMU handles physical drives or USB devices as storage in the VM.
