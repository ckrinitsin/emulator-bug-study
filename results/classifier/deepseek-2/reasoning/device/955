Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "support multiple UARTs in qemu-riscv-virt by default". The categories given are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Hmm, the report is about supporting multiple UARTs in QEMU's RISC-V virtual machine. I remember that QEMU handles various hardware devices, including serial ports or UARTs. So this seems related to adding more device support.

UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter; it's a type of serial port. In the context of QEMU, supporting multiple UARTs would likely involve adding new devices or configurations within the emulation. Since it's about hardware devices, the category should be 'device'. 

I don't think it's 'peripherals' because peripherals are more like input/output devices connected to a computer, but here we're talking about device support in QEMU itself. So yeah, 'device' seems right.

The bug report is about adding support for multiple UARTs in the QEMU RISC-V virtual machine. Since UARTs are hardware components and this involves enhancing device support within QEMU, the appropriate category is:

**device**
