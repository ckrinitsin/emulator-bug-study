Okay, so I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report mentions "pci-stub.o" and a function "do_pci_info". The error is during compilation of qemu-kvm on Mandriva Cooker. The user says they didn't compile it but are the maintainer there.

Looking at the categories: pci-stub relates to PCIs stubs, which handle device emulation or handling in QEMU. Since it's related to device drivers or device handling, the category would be "device". Other possibilities could be "peripherals", but "device" is more specific here.

The bug report involves an issue with `pci-stub.o` and the function `do_pci_info`, which suggests a problem with PCI device handling. This falls under the "device" category.
