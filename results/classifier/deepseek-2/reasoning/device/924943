Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user mentioned that USB host devices given via the command line aren't being fully routed to the guest. Let's break this down.

First, the issue seems related to USB devices and their interaction with the virtual machine. The problem occurs when starting QEMU with specific commands like -device usb-tablet and -usb-host. From what I know, USB host devices in QEMU are usually handled through USB controllers and device pass-through features.

The user tested different scenarios: starting QEMU normally and also using the console to add the device after the guest starts. In both cases, the Linux guest detects the USB device when it's plugged in at runtime but not at startup. For Windows, there's partial detection with a yellow exclamation mark, which suggests hardware issues.

Looking at the categories provided: assembly, graphic, network, etc., I think this is related to how devices are handled by QEMU's USB subsystem. The issue isn't about performance or kernel directly. It's more about device management and routing within the hypervisor environment.

The fact that it's happening with both KVM and the master branches suggests a deeper issue in how QEMU handles USB devices at startup versus runtime. This points towards a problem in device configuration or initialization, possibly under the "usb-host" device setup.

So, considering all this, the category should be related to device handling, specifically USB devices within the hypervisor context.
