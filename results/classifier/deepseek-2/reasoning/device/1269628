Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user submitted a feature request asking for TCG OPAL 2 emulation support in the virtio disk emulation. They want encryption at the host level using hardware acceleration like AES-NI or other cryptographic facilities. 

Looking at the categories, 'device' seems relevant because it's about adding functionality to a device (the disk) and enabling encryption which is a feature of the device driver.

Other possible categories were considered: network, but it's not related; kernel might be involved, but the main focus is on the device emulation. So 'device' is the best fit.

The user is requesting an enhancement for Virtio disk emulation to support TCG OPAL 2 encryption. This relates to enhancing the functionality of a specific hardware device (disk) within the virtualization environment.

**Answer:**

device
