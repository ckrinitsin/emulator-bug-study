Okay, I need to classify the bug report provided. The user mentioned that their host system crashes when using QEMU without setting the intel_iommu=on boot option. They noticed this issue started happening in newer kernel versions and didn't occur before.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The crash is related to DMA remapping when passing a physical device. This sounds like it's tied to how the IOMMU (I/O Memory Management Unit) is handlingDMA operations. Without intel_iommu=on, the system might not properly map these addresses, causing a crash.

Since this involves hardware device assignment and IOMMU state, it relates more to how devices are managed rather than translation or performance issues. The problem seems specific to device management under KVM, so the most fitting category is 'device'.

The bug report discusses a host system crash when using QEMU without the intel_iommu=on option, which suggests an issue with IOMMU state and DMA remapping for physical devices. This points to a problem in device management within the hypervisor environment.

**Answer:**
device
