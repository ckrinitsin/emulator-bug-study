Okay, so I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. The issue is that qemu-nbd fails to discard bigger chunks. Let me think about the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem occurs when using blkdiscard on a larger image (5G) with qemu-nbd. It works for smaller images but not bigger ones. Looking at the categories, 'device' seems relevant because it's related to block devices and how they handle operations like discard. Alternatively, 'network' might be considered since nbd is network-based, but the issue here isn't about networking per se but rather the handling of I/O requests on the device.

The bug report mentions that the discard_max_bytes is set high, but larger discards aren't working. This suggests it's an issue with how the block layer or the device driver handles large discard operations. Since qemu-nbd is a network block device, the problem might be in how the device (nbd) processes these requests.

I think 'device' is the most appropriate category because it's about the functionality of the block device and its ability to handle certain operations, especially when dealing with larger data chunks.

The bug report relates to qemu-nbd failing to handle larger discard operations on a block device. This points to an issue with how the device (qemu-nbd) manages I/O requests, particularly discards.

**device**
