Okay, I need to classify this bug report in QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user described a problem with Xenix installation under QEMU. After installing successfully, rebooting from the hard drive causes it to hang at the "Boot :" prompt. They noticed that this issue started occurring between versions 8.1 and 8.2. Through bisecting, they identified a specific commit (56b1f50e3c1) by @shentey as the culprit.

This commit moved connecting the RTC's ISA interrupt from `pc_basic_device_init()` to `*_realize()`. The user found that after this change, the RTC irq wasn't being wired up correctly. They reverted the commit and the problem was fixed.

Looking at the categories:

- **mistranslation**: This is about semantic mapping issues in code translation. Not directly related since it's about device initialization.
- **assembly**: Related to assembly lowering, which isn't the case here.
- **device**: The bug involves the RTC device not being initialized properly after a change, causing boot issues.
- **graphic**, **socket**, etc.: These don't seem relevant as the issue is with hardware devices during boot.

The problem lies in how the RTC's interrupt is handled during the initialization of the PC basic device. This affects the boot process, which is tied to the device's proper configuration. Since it's a device-related issue during boot, the most appropriate category is **device**.
