Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user is reporting that when using "pci_add auto storage" in QEMU with specific parameters, the command returns OK but no device is added to the guest.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue here is related to adding a PCI device automatically. The command seems to be about adding storage via PCI, but the device isn't appearing in the guest. This suggests it's an issue with how devices are being added or recognized by QEMU, specifically with the PCI configuration or auto-configuration feature.

It doesn't seem to relate to assembly lowering (assembly category), nor is it a performance or kernel issue. It's not about network, vnc, or hypervisor directly either. The problem is more about device addition and detection, which falls under the 'device' category.

The bug report involves an issue where a device isn't added despite the command indicating success. This relates to how devices are managed in QEMU, specifically the pci_add functionality, making it fall under the 'device' category.

**Answer:** device
