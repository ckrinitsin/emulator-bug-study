Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user is talking about issues with virtio block devices causing read errors in their VMs. They've upgraded from an older version of KVM (kvm-85) to 0.12.5-r1 and are now experiencing problems again.

First, I need to understand what virtio is. From what I remember, virtio is a virtualization technology that provides paravirtualized devices for better performance in virtual machines. So, when the user says they're using virtio block devices instead of emulated PIIX (which I think refers to an older emulation method), it's about how the storage devices are presented to the VM.

The problem occurs when the VM tries to boot from a virtio block device; it gets read errors and remounts the root filesystem as read-only. However, switching back to the emulated PIIX mode fixes the issue. So, the bug is specific to the virtio implementation in QEMU-KVM version 0.12.5-r1.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is related to block devices in a virtualized environment, which ties into storage I/O and how QEMU interacts with the host's hardware. Since the problem is specifically with virtio block devices, it falls under device-related issues because it's about the virtual device's operation rather than translation errors or other categories like network or graphics.

The user mentions that this worked fine in an older version of QEMU (0.11.1-r1) but broke after upgrading to 0.12.5-r1. This suggests a regression introduced in the newer version, likely related to how virtio devices are handled. The hardware differences on the failing host (Core2 Duo vs Core i7 and different RAID controllers) might be interacting with the QEMU's virtio implementation, but the core issue is still within the device emulation.

Therefore, the category should be 'device' because it pertains to the virtual block device's functionality in QEMU.

The bug report describes issues with read errors when using VirtIO block devices in QEMU-KVM 0.12.5-r1, which were resolved by reverting to emulated PIIX mode. The problem is specific to the VirtIO implementation, indicating a flaw in how virtual storage devices are handled. Given that it's related to device functionality and not other categories like translation or network issues, the appropriate classification is:

**device**
