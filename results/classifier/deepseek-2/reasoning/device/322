Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "Can't(?) disable default floppy drive any more in qemu 6.0". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user is saying they can't disable the default floppy drive anymore in QEMU 6.0. Floppy drives are a type of hardware device emulated by QEMU. So, the issue is related to device configuration or removal. 

Looking at the categories, "device" seems appropriate because it's about handling a specific hardware device (floppy drive). Other options like peripherals could be considered too, but since floppy drives are more specific and traditionally part of device emulation in QEMU, "device" fits better.

I don't think it's related to assembly or mistranslation because the problem is about configuration rather than code translation. It's not performance-related either. So, the correct category is probably "device".
