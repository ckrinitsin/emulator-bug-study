Okay, so I need to classify this bug report in QEMU. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is having an issue where their mouse isn't moving in the guest VM. They mention that they can pass through the mouse, keyboard, and Xbox controller using a script. The mouse works in some ways—like triggering hot corners—but the cursor doesn't move. So, the physical devices are recognized (since the keyboard and controller work), but the pointer movement is not registered.

They're using QEMU 10.0-rc1 and kernel 6.14.0 on both host (Mint) and guest (Arch). They have virglrenderer installed on the host and specific Vulkan packages on the guest. The user also tried different device configurations, like using -usbdevice or -device options, but it didn't fix the issue.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. Since the problem is about mouse input not being handled correctly, this likely relates to how devices are passed through or emulated in QEMU. The fact that the mouse works partially (hot corners) suggests it's recognized but there's a issue with how the cursor movement events are processed.

I think this falls under 'device' category because it's about hardware device input not being correctly handled in the VM.

The bug is related to device handling, specifically the mouse input not functioning as expected despite the devices being recognized. This points to an issue in how QEMU manages or passes through the mouse device.
