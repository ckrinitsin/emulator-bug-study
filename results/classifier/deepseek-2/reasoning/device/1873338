Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user mentioned that the "on the fly" CD image replacement isn't working with DOS. They tried using the console commands to eject and change the CD, but the system doesn't recognize the new image until they reboot the VM.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue seems related to how QEMU handles CD drives and image changes without a reboot. This sounds like a problem with the device handling, specifically the IDE or CD-ROM device. When they eject and change the ISO, it's not being recognized until a restart, which suggests that the device isn't properly reinitializing or reloading the new image.

So, considering the categories, "device" seems appropriate because it pertains to hardware devices (like the CD-ROM) not functioning as expected after configuration changes. The other categories don't fit as wellâ€”this isn't a graphical issue or a network problem but rather how QEMU interacts with the virtualized device.
