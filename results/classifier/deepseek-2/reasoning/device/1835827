Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The issue is about HTIF symbols not being recognized by the RISC-V Spike board.

Looking at the commit mentioned, it seems that a function called `load_kernel()` was moved and renamed to `riscv_load_kernel()`, and during this change, `htif_symbol_callback()` was no longer included. This suggests that there's an issue with how symbols are being handled in the RISC-V emulation.

Since HTIF (Host Interface) is related to communication between the guest and host, and the Spike board is a specific device emulated by QEMU, this likely falls under the 'device' category because it pertains to hardware-specific issues. Alternatively, it could relate to 'graphic' if it were display-related, but that's not the case here.

Considering other categories like 'network', 'socket', or 'hypervisor' doesn't seem relevant. The problem is more about device-level interaction and symbol handling during kernel loading for a specific board, so 'device' seems appropriate.

The bug report involves an issue with the RISC-V Spike board not recognizing HTIF symbols after a code change that moved the `load_kernel()` function to `riscv_load_kernel()`, removing `htif_symbol_callback()`. This relates to device-specific behavior in QEMU.

**device**

Answer: device
