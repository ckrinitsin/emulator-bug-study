Alright, let's figure out how to classify this bug report in QEMU. The user is talking about issues with migration using `--copy-storage-all` or `--copy-storage-inc`. They mention that when the guest OS is busy, especially under heavy load, the migration takes a very long time or hangs, particularly in newer versions of QEMU.

So, I need to look at the possible categories and see which one fits best. The options are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about migration convergence problems when the guest is under load. This doesn't seem to be a problem in user-mode or with assembly translation since it's more related to how QEMU handles storage during migration, especially under stress. Performance issues are definitely a key point here because the user mentions that newer versions take much longer.

Looking at other categories like device, graphic, or networkâ€”none of these seem directly relevant. It's not about hardware devices, graphics drivers, or networking specifically. KVM is related to virtualization but more so for hypervisor features rather than migration performance.

The problem seems to stem from how QEMU manages resources during migration when the guest is active. This affects the overall performance and might involve how storage is being handled, which ties into the 'performance' category as it's impacting the efficiency of the process.

So, considering all this, the most appropriate category for this bug report is 'performance'.

The issue revolves around QEMU migration performance under guest load, fitting the 'performance' category.
