Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user mentioned that QEMU runs slowly when the window is in the background. Specifically, they set GDK_BACKEND=x11 and added gl=on to the display option. When these are omitted, the issue goes away. 

Looking at the possible categories: performance is one of them. The problem seems related to how QEMU handles graphics or rendering when the window isn't active. Since using X11 with OpenGL enabled causes a slowdown, it's likely affecting the graphical performance.

Other options like graphic or device could be relevant, but performance is more specific to the issue describedâ€”slowness and freezing, which are directly related to how efficiently QEMU is running under those conditions.

So, I think the best category here is performance.
