Okay, I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. The user mentioned that the problem is related to swap increasing until the system freezes and dies. They didn't notice any specific pattern, just that it happens more often.

Looking at the possible categories: performance, kernel, memory management... Hmm, swap usage increasing and causing a freeze sounds like a memory issue. QEMU handles virtual machines, so maybe when running VMs with heavy memory use, QEMU isn't managing the system's memory efficiently, leading to excessive swapping.

The other options don't fit as well. It's not an assembly or translation problem since it's about resource management. The system-wide effect suggests it's a kernel or performance issue rather than something specific like networking or peripherals.
