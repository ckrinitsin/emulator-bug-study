Alright, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user wants me to respond with just one word from the given list.

Looking at the bug report, it mentions QEMU failing when setting an MSR and provides an example of how features are displayed. The main issue here is about debugging, specifically making MSR features more human-readable to help with troubleshooting.

The possible categories include 'debug' as one option. Since this feature request is aimed at improving debugging by providing clearer information, the most appropriate category seems to be 'debug'.
