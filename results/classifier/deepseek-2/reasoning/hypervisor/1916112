Okay, so I have this bug report where QEMU crashes on a Jetson Nano with an "Illegal Instruction" error during kernel boot. The user is trying to use native emulation for Raspbian Buster using QEMU built from source with KVM enabled. 

Looking at the details, the build configuration includes --enable-kvm, and when they run QEMU, it's using TCG as the accelerator despite having KVM available. The error message mentions an assertion failure in physmem.c related to kvm_enabled(), indicating that there might be a conflict between KVM and the way memory is being handled.

I need to classify this bug into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

The error occurs during kernel boot and involves KVM being enabled but causing issues. The user is asking if it's a QEMU problem or something with their build and also why TCG is used instead of KVM. The crash message points to an issue in the memory initialization when KVM is active.

This seems related to how QEMU handles KVM, possibly incorrect setup or interaction between the hypervisor (KVM) and the emulation parts. Since it's about KVM usage and a kernel-related function failing, I'm leaning towards "hypervisor" as the category because KVM is a hypervisor, and the problem arises when trying to use it.

The bug report involves an issue with QEMU crashing due to an illegal instruction when KVM is enabled. The error message points to a failure in memory initialization specific to KVM usage, indicating a potential conflict or misconfiguration related to hypervisor functions.
