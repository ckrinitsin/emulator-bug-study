Okay, let's try to figure out what category this bug report falls into. The user is reporting that QEMU version 2.4.0 hangs and uses 100% CPU when using the --enable-kvm option. They also mention that the graphical display isn't initialized.

First, I'll note that KVM is involved since the command includes --enable-kvm. So that's a clue pointing towards hypervisor-related issues because QEMU with KVM acts as a hypervisor for virtualization.

The symptoms are hanging and high CPU usage. This suggests something is wrong in the initialization or operation of the virtual machine. The user also mentions that downgrading QEMU to 2.3 works, which indicates a regression between versions.

Looking at possible categories: "hypervisor" seems directly related because KVM is part of the hypervisor functionality in QEMU. Other options like "performance" could be considered since it's about CPU usage, but the primary issue here is with KVM not functioning correctly.

The user mentions that graphical output isn't initialized, which might point to issues with device or graphic drivers, but the main problem seems to stem from KVM enabling causing the hang. So the root cause is likely within the hypervisor setup rather than graphics.

Therefore, the category should be "hypervisor" because it's a QEMU issue related to KVM functionality.
