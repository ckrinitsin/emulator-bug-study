Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "how to install gemu guest agent without configure script ?". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, let's understand what the bug report is about. The user is asking how to install the "gemu guest agent" without using a configure script. I'm not entirely sure what gemu isâ€”it might be a typo for QEMU or another emulator. Assuming it's related to QEMU since that's the context given.

The term "guest agent" typically refers to software running in a virtual machine to provide certain functionalities, like access to hardware devices or better integration with the host. In QEMU, this could relate to Virtio drivers or other guest tools.

Now, looking at the categories: The issue isn't about translation from source to IR (mistranslation) or assembly lowering (assembly). It's not a performance issue, kernel-related, or about permissions either. Similarly, it doesn't seem to involve graphics, sockets, networking, VNC, or debugging directly.

The user is asking about installation without a configure script. The configure script is part of the build process, typically used in software projects to generate Makefiles with system-specific settings. If they're trying to install a guest agent (which might be a separate package), not having a configure script could relate to how it's built or installed.

But since the question is about installation, which often doesn't require compiling from source but rather installing pre-compiled packages. However, without more context, it's hard to say. If this is about KVM, which is part of QEMU for virtualization, maybe the guest agent setup is under that category.

Alternatively, "hypervisor" might be relevant because KVM is a hypervisor, and the guest agent interacts with the hypervisor layer. Or perhaps it's more about peripherals since the guest agent could be interacting with hardware devices.

Wait, looking again at the categories: "peripherals" relates to hardware devices in the VM, which the guest agent might manage. Alternatively, "hypervisor" is about KVM itself. Since the user mentioned QEMU (as per the initial context), and KVM is part of QEMU's capabilities as a hypervisor.

But I'm not sure if installation without a configure script falls under any specific category beyond 'other' because it's more about installation methodology rather than a bug in functionality, performance, etc. However, since the user is asking how to do something, perhaps it's an issue with installation procedures which might fall under 'other'.

Wait, but considering that the guest agent is part of KVM management, maybe it should be categorized under 'hypervisor'. Or if it's about device drivers in the guest (like Virtio), then 'peripherals' would fit.

Alternatively, since they're asking about the absence of a configure script, which relates to build configuration, but installation isn't necessarily tied to that. Maybe it's more about 'other'.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the user is specifically asking about installing a guest agent without using a configure script, and given the categories, maybe it's best to categorize this under 'KVM' since KVM is the hypervisor part of QEMU that interacts with guest agents.
