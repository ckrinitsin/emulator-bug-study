Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "FEAT_PAuth trapping behaviour incorrectly emulated on Secure-EL0/1 with Secure-EL2 disabled". The possible categories include things like mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, etc.

First, FEAT_PAuth likely refers to a feature related to ARM's Pointer Authentication (PAUTH), which is part of the architecture for securing pointers. Trapping behavior usually relates to how exceptions or traps are handled in the CPU.

Secure-EL0/1 and Secure-EL2 refer to different exception levels in the ARM security model. When Secure-EL2 is disabled, the system might not be handling certain traps correctly at lower ELs. Since this issue is about incorrect emulation of trapping behavior, it's likely related to how the hypervisor or kernel handles these exceptions.

Looking at the categories, 'hypervisor' makes sense because hypervisors manage virtual machines and handle such low-level features. If the trapping isn't emulated properly when Secure-EL2 is disabled, it could be a problem in the hypervisor layer of QEMU.

I don't think it's 'mistranslation' or 'assembly lowering' because those are more about code translation issues. It also doesn't seem to fit into categories like 'network' or 'graphic'. The issue is specific to security and exception handling, which points towards 'hypervisor'.
