Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the predefined categories. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The issue is about CR4.VMX leaking from L1 into L2 on Intel VMX. The user provided code snippets where a guest tries to manipulate CR4 and ends up causing a general-protection fault. This happens when QEMU marks CR4 as dirty during `savevm`, leading to unintended leakage of L1's CR4 bits (specifically VMXE) into the L2 guest.

The categories I have are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

I know that this relates to virtualization. Since QEMU is involved and the problem mentions KVM semantics, it's likely tied to the hypervisor layer. The issue occurs during nested virtualization, which involves how QEMU (as a hypervisor) manages VMX capabilities between different layers of virtual machines.

Looking at the categories, 'hypervisor' seems appropriate because the bug relates to the interaction between different levels of virtual machines managed by KVM/QEMU. It's not about translation issues or performance but rather about proper handling of VMX bits during state management in nested environments.
