Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

Looking at the problem description, QEMU crashes when running inside Hyper-V on an AMD EPYC VM. The error messages include "KVM internal error" and mention VNC server running but not initializing the display. Also, it works on an Intel VM but not AMD.

The key points are:
- Crash with KVM internal error.
- Runs under Hyper-V (which is a hypervisor).
- Different behavior between AMD EPYC and Intel CPUs.

KVM errors usually relate to the kernel-based virtual machine module in Linux. Since this is happening inside Hyper-V, which is Microsoft's hypervisor, there might be an interaction issue or compatibility problem between QEMU-KVM and Hyper-V on AMD hardware.

The error message points directly to KVM issues, so it's likely a problem with how KVM is handling the virtualization under these conditions. It doesn't seem related to translation, assembly lowering, graphics, sockets, network, etc., but more about hypervisor-level problems.

So the most appropriate category here would be "hypervisor" because it's dealing with issues related to running QEMU within a hypervisor environment (Hyper-V), specifically on AMD hardware.
