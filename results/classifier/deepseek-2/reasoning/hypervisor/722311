Okay, so I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem again.

The user is experiencing a segmentation fault when starting QEMU without the "-enable-kvm" parameter, specifically with versions 0.13.0 and 0.14.0. This issue doesn't happen in version 0.12.5. They're using different hardware: Pentium 4 and Core 2 Duo.

First, I should understand what "-enable-kvm" does. KVM is a virtualization technology that allows QEMU to use hardware-assisted virtualization if available. So when you run without "-enable-kvm", QEMU might be trying to emulate virtualization in software instead of using the hardware extensions.

The bug occurs on multiple computers, so it's likely not specific to any particular hardware beyond what's already mentioned. The user mentions that a black window appears briefly before the segmentation fault, which suggests that some part of the graphical initialization is happening but then crashes.

Looking at the categories provided: 

- Mistranslation, assembly, etc., seem related more to code generation or low-level issues.
- Device, graphic, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor are other options.

Since this issue is specifically about running without KVM support and the crash happening upon startup, it's likely related to how QEMU initializes or interacts with KVM when the parameter isn't provided. Without "-enable-kvm", QEMU might attempt to use the default virtualization method, which could lead to issues in newer versions where some code paths aren't properly handled.

In older versions (0.12.5), it worked without KVM, but starting at 0.13.0, it crashes. This suggests a regression introduced in those versions related to how QEMU handles the absence of KVM support during initialization.

The crash is a segmentation fault, which points towards an issue with memory access or invalid pointer dereference. If QEMU expects certain structures or resources when running without KVM but they aren't properly initialized, it could lead to such crashes.

Considering the categories, "hypervisor" makes sense because QEMU acts as a hypervisor in this context. Alternatively, since KVM is involved (even if not enabled), the bug might fall under that category. However, the issue arises when KVM isn't enabled, so perhaps it's more related to how QEMU handles non-KVM mode.

Wait, looking back at the categories: "KVM" is one of them. The problem occurs without enabling KVM, but maybe the code still expects some KVM-related setup even when it's disabled. So the issue might be in the handling of KVM support or its absence, which would fall under the "hypervisor" category because QEMU as a hypervisor relies on KVM for better performance.

Alternatively, since KVM is part of the virtualization stack and without it, there could be issues in how the emulator runs. But considering that the crash occurs upon startup without enabling KVM, it's more about the initial setup when KVM isn't used. Therefore, the issue relates to the hypervisor's initialization process.

So I think "hypervisor" is the correct category here.
