Okay, so I'm looking at this bug report about QEMU. The user mentioned that when they remove a SCSI disk from their RHEL guest, the partitions on "/dev/sdb" are still showing up when they run fdisk. This isn't happening with virtio disks, though. Let me try to figure out which category this falls into.

First, I know that QEMU is a hypervisor, and it emulates various hardware for virtual machines. SCSI disks would be part of the storage emulation. When you add a disk through virt-manager, QEMU creates a corresponding device in the guest. If the disk is removed, the guest's system should no longer see that device.

The bug here is that even after removing the SCSI disk, fdisk still shows partitions on "/dev/sdb". That suggests that the storage device isn't being properly cleaned up in the guest OS. The fact that this doesn't happen with virtio disks implies it's specific to how SCSI disks are handled in QEMU.

Looking at the categories provided: hypervisor, kernel, peripherals, etc. Since this is related to disk devices and their removal not being reflected correctly, it's probably a problem in how the hypervisor (QEMU) manages the hardware devices. The guest OS still thinks the device exists because the hypervisor isn't properly notifying it of the disk's removal.

I don't think it's an issue with assembly lowering or mistranslation because those are more about code translation, not hardware device management. It also doesn't seem like a network or socket issue; it's purely about storage devices.

Therefore, this seems to fall under the hypervisor category since it's related to how QEMU manages virtual SCSI disks and their removal.
