Okay, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report about QEMU. The user is having trouble with Windows 98 video card passthrough where they can't load higher resolutions after some games crash. They have to reboot the entire Linux machine, not just the VM.

Hmm, so the issue revolves around the video card or graphics in the virtual machine. When certain old games run and switch resolutions, the VM gets stuck. After a full system reboot, text mode works fine, but graphical mode doesn't load properly—just a black screen with input blinking.

I'm thinking this is related to how QEMU handles the passthrough of video cards. Since it's affecting the graphical display and requires a full machine reset, it might be a problem with how the hypervisor (QEMU in this case) manages the video hardware. Alternatively, maybe there's an issue with device drivers or the way the VM resets after crashes.

The user mentions they've tested it with multiple video cards and drivers, so it points more towards a QEMU/KVM issue rather than individual components. They also note that using the right ROMs helps sometimes but isn't a complete fix.

I'm leaning towards "device" because it's about a specific hardware component (video card) not functioning correctly in the VM. Alternatively, it could be under "graphic" since it directly affects display output. However, considering QEMU's role as a hypervisor managing device passthrough, "hypervisor" might also fit.

Wait, the user specifically mentions KVM in their note about guessing it's a problem with QEMU/KVM video card passthrough. So "KVM" could be the category since it's related to how virtualization is handled, especially for hardware like graphics cards.

But another angle: if the issue occurs because of incorrect translation or mapping when handling the video card in user-mode, that would fall under "mistranslation." However, the problem seems more about device management after a crash rather than a direct semantic error during translation.

Given all this, I think the best fit is either "hypervisor" or "device." Since KVM is part of QEMU's hypervisor role, and the issue is with video passthrough, it might be under "KVM."

Wait no—the initial categories given include "graphic" as a separate category. The problem is specifically about graphical display issues after crashes in games, so "graphic" seems more precise.

But I'm confused because "hypervisor" isn't listed; the options are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals. So KVM is an option, but so is "graphic."

The user's main issue is with video output after crashes in games, which suggests it's a graphics-related problem during VM operation. So maybe "graphic" is the right category.

Alternatively, if the problem arises from how QEMU/KVM handles resets or device passthrough, then "hypervisor" would be more accurate. But since "KVM" is an option and the user mentions KVM in their report, that's a strong clue.

Wait no—the bug report explicitly states it's part of QEMU, which uses KVM for virtualization. The issue is with video passthrough not working correctly after crashes, leading to needing a full system reboot. This points towards a problem within how QEMU/KVM manages the device (video card) in the VM.

So considering all that, I think "device" would be appropriate because it's about handling a specific hardware device (the video card). Alternatively, if it's related to how the hypervisor handles device resets or driver issues, then perhaps "hypervisor." But looking at the options again: "device," "graphic," and "KVM" are all possibilities.

Since the user directly mentions KVM as part of their guess for the problem, I think that's the most relevant category here. It seems like an issue within the QEMU/KVM virtualization environment regarding device passthrough.
