Okay, I need to classify this bug report. The user mentioned QEMU UEFI for RISC-V64 failing to load their DIY bootloader. They followed steps involving creating a FAT32 image and using xorriso. It worked on x64 and AArch64 but not on RISC-V64. The error is an unknown reason with a page fault.

Looking at the categories, possible ones are hypervisor, device, or maybe kernel. Since it's QEMU, which is a hypervisor, and UEFI issues might relate to how the hypervisor handles bootloaders in different architectures.

The problem seems related to the interaction between QEMU's UEFI implementation and their RISC-V64 bootloader. Maybe there's an issue with how QEMU loads or executes EFI images for RISC-V. This could be a bug within the hypervisor's handling of certain architectures, especially when it comes to UEFI services or memory management during boot.

I think the category should be 'hypervisor' because it's about how QEMU (a hypervisor) is interacting with the bootloader on a specific architecture.
