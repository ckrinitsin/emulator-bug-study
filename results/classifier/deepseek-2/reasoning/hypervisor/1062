Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through the problem description carefully.

The issue is related to AArch64 and the SCR_EL3.RW bit behavior in QEMU. The user mentions that according to ARM documentation (DDI 0487G.a), when both EL2 and EL1 don't support Aarch32, the SCR_EL3.RW bit should be RAO/WI. However, the function `scr_write` in `target/arm/helper.c` isn't correctly handling this scenario.

The bug affects code that's supposed to run at EL3 reset, trying to return to EL1. The provided assembly example uses some instructions to set up SPSR_EL3 and ELR_EL3 before an eret. This suggests the problem is in how the hypervisor or kernel handles these system registers during a VM reset or boot process.

Looking at the possible categories: the issue seems related to how QEMU's ARM emulation handles certain CPU features, specifically around Aarch32 support and EL levels. The function `scr_write` modifies system control registers, which are part of the hypervisor or kernel's responsibilities in an emulated environment like QEMU.

The problem isn't about user-mode assembly translation (mistranslation) but rather about how the hypervisor component correctly models CPU behavior regarding these specific bits. Since it's related to the hypervisor's handling of system registers during EL transitions, the category should be 'hypervisor'.
