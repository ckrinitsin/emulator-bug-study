Alright, I need to classify this bug report: " FIXME xhci_alloc_device_streams:972 guest streams config not identical for all eps". Let me break it down.

First, the function is xhci_alloc_device_streams. XHCI stands for eXtensible Host Controller Interface, which is related to USB controllers in virtual machines. So, this seems to be part of the QEMU's USB emulation or KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) hypervisor component.

The bug message mentions that guest streams configuration isn't identical for all Eps. "EPS" likely stands for Endpoint, as in USB endpoints. Each USB device can have multiple endpoints with different configurations. If the guest streams aren't consistent across all Eps, it could cause issues like incorrect data handling or device malfunction in the virtual machine.

Looking at the possible categories: hypervisor is one of them. Since XHCI is part of how QEMU emulates hardware for VMs, which falls under hypervisor functions. Other categories like 'device' or 'graphic' don't seem to fit as well because this isn't about a specific device malfunction or graphical issues.

Therefore, the bug relates to the hypervisor's USB emulation, specifically in how streams are allocated across endpoints, making it fall under the hypervisor category.
