Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The user is running Blender inside an AMD Docker container on an M1 Mac using noVNC. They're encountering an error where /proc/cpuinfo doesn't have 'cpu MHz', which causes Blender to crash. The error message mentions a failed function in timing.cpp related to Arch_InitTickTimer, leading to an aborted signal.

The key issue here is that the guest CPU information isn't being presented correctly in /proc/cpuinfo for various architectures, including M1 Macs. Since Docker is involved on macOS, it's likely using QEMU under the hood to emulate different architectures. The problem seems related to how the hypervisor (QEMU) reports CPU info to the guest OS.

Looking at the categories provided: 'hypervisor' fits because this issue involves QEMU as the hypervisor not correctly providing CPU information to the virtual machine (Docker container). Other categories like 'device', 'network', or 'graphic' don't seem to fit here. It's specifically about CPU info, which ties into how the hypervisor presents hardware details.

Therefore, the most appropriate category for this bug is 'hypervisor'.
