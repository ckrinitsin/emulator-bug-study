Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "Default console changes break Xen command-line". Let's look at the possible categories provided.

First, the bug mentions Xen and the command line, so Xen is a hypervisor, right? Because Xen is a type of hypervisor that runs on x86 hardware. The issue here seems related to how the default console settings in QEMU affect the Xen command-line interface. 

Looking at the categories: hypervisor is one of them. Other options like "network" or "graphic" don't fit as well because the problem isn't with networking or graphics but rather with the command line interface for a hypervisor.

So, I think the correct category here is "hypervisor".
