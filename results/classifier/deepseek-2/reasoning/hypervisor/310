Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "unable to migrate non shared storage when TLS is used." The categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the issue involves migration of non-shared storage with TLS. Migration in QEMU typically relates to live migration, which is handled by the hypervisor or the underlying virtualization layer. Since it's related to network communication (TLS implies secure connections over a network), but more specifically about storage during migration, this likely ties into how the hypervisor manages resources during live migrations.

Looking at the categories, "hypervisor" seems the most fitting because it's dealing with the core functionality of QEMU as a hypervisor. The problem isn't related to translation issues (mistranslation), assembly code, devices, graphics, sockets, or network in a general sense but specifically about storage during migration, which is a hypervisor-level operation.

I don't think it falls under "network" because while TLS is used for secure communication, the issue is with storage migration, not network connectivity itself. It's also not about KVM as a separate category unless the hypervisor part isn't distinct enough, but QEMU's hypervisor role is more general.

So, the best fit is "hypervisor."
