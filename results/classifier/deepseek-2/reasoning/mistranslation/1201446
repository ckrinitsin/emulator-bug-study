Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user described an issue where certain instructions aren't throwing SIGILL as expected. Specifically, when using QEMU with -cpu=486, CMOV instructions (which are not supported by i486) don't cause the program to crash with an illegal instruction error. Instead, QEMU allows them to execute, which isn't what should happen on real hardware.

Looking at the categories: 

- Mistranslation is about incorrect mapping from source to target architecture.
- Assembly lowering might be related but seems more focused on translation steps rather than supported instructions.
- The bug is about unsupported instructions not triggering an error, so it's a problem in how QEMU handles instruction support for different CPUs.

It doesn't fit into device, graphic, socket, network, etc. It also isn't related to KVM, boot, or vnc. It's more about the CPU emulation and whether certain instructions are correctly flagged as illegal.

Therefore, this seems like a mistranslation issue because QEMU is incorrectly allowing these instructions to run when they shouldn't be supported by the targeted CPU.
