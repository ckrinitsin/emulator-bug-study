Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through the problem description carefully.

The issue arises when QEMU is compiled on macOS 15.4 but run on an older version like 15.1. The problem is that the `strchrnul` function isn't available in versions prior to 15.4, causing a segfault. 

The root cause is identified as the Meson test not including the appropriate header when checking for `strchrnul`. Without specifying the correct header, the compiler might detect the function even if it's not present in the target environment.

So, this issue relates to how functions are detected during compilation. It's about whether the build system correctly checks for function availability across different environments, which ties into the correctness of the code generation or lowering from source to IR/target. This sounds like a problem with semantic mapping, specifically incorrect detection leading to usage on systems where it doesn't exist.

Given the categories, "mistranslation" seems appropriate because it's about how functions are mapped or detected across different environments during compilation, affecting the target runtime behavior.
