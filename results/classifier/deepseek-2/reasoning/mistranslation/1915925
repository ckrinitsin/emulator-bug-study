Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the provided categories. The issue is about ARM semihosting HEAPINFO writing results to a wrong address.

First, let's understand what's happening. The user mentioned that according to the ARM spec, the PARAMETER REGISTER contains the address of a pointer to a four-field data block. However, QEMU treats it as pointing directly to the four-field data block instead of a pointer to it.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation refers to incorrect mapping from source architecture to IR/target, which could involve issues with how parameters are handled. This seems relevant because the problem is about misinterpreting where the data should be written.

Other categories like assembly or device don't fit here. The issue isn't with assembly code directly but with how QEMU handles a specific system call's parameter.

So, the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the parameter register in the translation from ARM to the target architecture, making 'mistranslation' the correct category.
