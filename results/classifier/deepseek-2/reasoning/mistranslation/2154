Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. The problem is that when reading the ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1 register using `mrs`, it returns all zeros. This register's ST field (ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1.ST) indicates support for small translation tables (FEAT_TTST), which is a new feature.

The user mentioned that QEMU has implemented FEAT_TTST as per their release notes, but the register isn't reflecting this correctly. Since ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1 is a system register related to MMU features, it's part of the architecture's translation and memory management.

Looking at the categories provided: 'translation' and 'assembly lowering' seem relevant. The bug could be due to incorrect mapping from the target (AArch64) to the IR or user-mode handling. However, since it's about a specific system register not being properly set, it might fall under 'mistranslation'. Alternatively, if it's related to how QEMU handles assembly instructions during lowering, it could be 'assembly'.

But considering that the issue is with a specific hardware feature's support in the emulated environment, and since FEAT_TTST is part of the architecture's translation tables, the bug is likely due to incorrect handling during the translation from guest code to host instructions. Therefore, the category should be 'mistranslation'.

The bug relates to an incorrect value being returned for a system register in QEMU's AArch64 implementation. This suggests that there's a problem with how certain features (like FEAT_TTST) are handled during translation from the guest architecture to the host environment.

**Answer: mistranslation**
