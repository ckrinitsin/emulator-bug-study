Okay, so I have this bug report where qemu-arm-static is stuck at 100% CPU when cross-compiling Emacs using Docker. The user provided details about their setup and the steps they're taking.

First, let me parse the issue. They're building a Docker image for multi-arch support, specifically targeting arm architecture. When running the build command, it gets stuck with qemu-arm-static at full CPU usage. They mentioned that this happens consistently across different QEMU versions: 2.11.1 (OS version), 4.1.1-1, and 4.2.0-2.

Looking at their strace output, they're seeing repeated calls to getdents64 and tgkill, with EAGAIN errors. This suggests that the process is trying to send signals but resources are temporarily unavailable. The issue seems related to how QEMU or the underlying emulation handles system calls during compilation.

Now, considering the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem occurs during cross-compiling, which implies it's related to how QEMU emulates the target architecture. Since they're using qemu-arm-static in user-mode, this might be a translation issue between the host (x86_64) and target (arm) architectures.

Possible reasons could include incorrect handling of syscalls by the QEMU translator, leading to infinite loops or high CPU usage. Alternatively, it might be related to how signals are handled when switching between user space and kernel space in the emulator.

The bug report mentions that it happens across multiple versions, so it's likely a deeper issue with the translation layer rather than a specific version quirk. The EAGAIN error suggests some resource is being contended or not properly managed during emulation.

Therefore, this seems to fall under "mistranslation" as it's about how QEMU maps the source (x86_64) to the target (arm) architecture incorrectly, causing the high CPU usage and hang.

The bug report describes an issue where qemu-arm-static becomes stuck at 100% CPU when cross-compiling Emacs. The problem occurs during the Docker build process and is consistent across multiple QEMU versions. The strace output shows repeated getdents64 and tgkill calls with EAGAIN errors, indicating issues with signal handling or resource management in the emulation environment.

The issue likely stems from how QEMU translates x86_64 system calls to arm instructions during user-mode emulation, possibly leading to an infinite loop. Since this affects the translation layer between architectures, the appropriate category is:

mistranslation
