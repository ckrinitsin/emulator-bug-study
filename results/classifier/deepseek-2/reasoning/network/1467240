Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The issue is about bridged networking being broken for Mac OS X guests in QEMU. 

The user provided that they followed specific instructions using a link, and when they replaced the netdev argument with bridge configuration, it stopped working. They mentioned that it works in QEMU 2.3.0 but breaks in the git version.

Looking at the bug report, the problem lies in networking since it's about DHCP issues with bridged networking. The user is using a specific setup for Mac OS X under QEMU, and there was a regression introduced by commit a90a7425... which dropped tap_can_send. 

The category options include 'network' as one of the choices. Since this issue directly relates to network functionality (bridged networking, DHCP) and the problematic code is in the tap driver (tap_can_send), it's definitely a network-related bug.

Other categories like 'hypervisor' or 'kernel' don't fit here because the problem isn't with QEMU as a hypervisor or the host kernel but rather with the network setup within QEMU. The same goes for other options like 'graphic', 'socket', etc., which aren't relevant to this specific issue.

Therefore, the appropriate category is 'network'.

The bug report discusses an issue where bridged networking stops working for Mac OS X guests under QEMU after a certain commit. This specifically affects network functionality, particularly how the tap device interacts with the main loop and sends data. Since the problem is related to the network setup and communication within QEMU, the category that best fits this issue is 'network'.

**Answer:**
network
