Okay, let me try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The problem is that binding a second VM to the same OVS vhost-user port causes the first VM's traffic to break. So both VMs are trying to use the same port.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. Since it involves VM networking and Open vSwitch (OVS), which is related to network devices in virtualization, I think 'network' might be the right category. The issue seems to stem from how the OVS port is being shared between two VMs, leading to conflicts.

The user also mentioned using QEMU with KVM, but the specific problem is about networking through OVS ports, so it's more related to network configuration rather than the hypervisor itself or device drivers. Therefore, 'network' seems appropriate.
