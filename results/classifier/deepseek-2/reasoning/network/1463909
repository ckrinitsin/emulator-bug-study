Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the provided categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the problem description, it's about virtio networking not working when the guest's eth0 isn't in promiscuous mode. The user is experiencing issues with HTTP responses from the QEMU guest machine until they enable promiscuous mode on the guest's interface. 

The setup involves multiple LANs and network interfaces (eth0, eth1) with VLAN configurations. They're using iptables for NAT routing. When packets come through eth0, they don't reach the guest unless the guest is in promiscuous mode. This suggests a networking issue within QEMU.

Possible categories that come to mind are 'network' since it's related to network communication between host and guest, or 'device' if it's about hardware device handling. But since it's specifically about VirtIO networking, which is a virtualization technology for devices, but more about the network interface.

The user mentioned using QEMU with VirtIO NICs, so maybe it's a bug in how QEMU handles network packets when the guest isn't in promiscuous mode. The fact that packets are leaving the tap0 interface but not arriving at eth0 indicates a problem in how QEMU is routing or handling these packets.

Given that the issue revolves around network traffic not being received by the guest unless in promiscuous mode, it's likely a networking-related bug in QEMU. Therefore, the category should be 'network'.
