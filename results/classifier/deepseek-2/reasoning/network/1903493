Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is talking about adding wireless network card bridging support in QEMU-KVM, mentioning that other hypervisors like VirtualBox and VMware have this feature. They want it available through virt-manager instead of using bridge-utils.

First, I need to look at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and others.

The issue is about networking, specifically wireless bridging. So 'network' seems relevant because it's related to the network functionality of QEMU-KVM. They're not talking about the graphical interface, so 'graphic' isn't right. It's also not a performance issue or kernel-related as far as I can tell.

Looking deeper, they mention KVM in the title, but the main focus is on the networking feature, which is part of QEMU's network support for virtual machines. Therefore, 'network' seems like the most appropriate category here.
