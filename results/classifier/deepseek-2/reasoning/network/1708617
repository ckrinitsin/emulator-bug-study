Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user provided a detailed scenario where they're encountering an issue when using QEMU 2.9 with OVS and DPDK. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the environment setup: They're using QEMU 2.9, DPDK 16.11, and OVS 2.6.1 on a Linux host. The guest OS is the same as the host. They start two QEMU VMs using vhostuser ports as servers. Then they add a bridge (br1) and configure it with two vhostuser client ports pointing to specific server paths.

After setting everything up, pinging between the two VMs works fine initially. However, when they restart the OVS process, the ping starts failing. The interesting part is that downgrading QEMU to version 2.7 fixes the issue, meaning it works correctly then.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and other.

The problem seems to revolve around connectivity between VMs after a service restart. The failure occurs in the networking layer when using OVS with DPDK as a backend. Since QEMU is involved in setting up virtio-net-pci devices and handling network traffic via vhost-user sockets, this points towards a networking issue.

Additionally, since they're using KVM (as indicated by --enable-kvm), but the problem isn't directly related to KVM functionality itself but rather the network setup post-restart. The fact that downgrading QEMU fixes it suggests a regression in version 2.9 that was present in 2.7.

Possible areas could be in how QEMU handles vhost-user sockets or interacts with OVS's DPDK-based ports after a service restart. This likely falls under network-related issues rather than something else like graphical problems or socket handling at a lower level.

I think the correct category here is 'network' because the primary issue revolves around network connectivity between VMs, especially after an OVS restart. The problem doesn't seem to be with the hypervisor itself (KVM), nor does it relate directly to sockets in isolationâ€”it's more about how networking components interact post-restart.
