Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into one of the given categories. The user mentioned that converting images using FTP or HTTP is slower than optimal.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about how QEMU handles FTP and HTTP transfers. The current method involves multiple steps like connecting, asking for file size, and retrieving chunks in a loop, which is slow. The suggested better approach reduces the number of connections and just retrieves all data at once.

This seems related to network performance because it's dealing with how data is transferred over FTP and HTTP. So the category would be 'network' since it's about optimizing data transfer speeds over these protocols.
