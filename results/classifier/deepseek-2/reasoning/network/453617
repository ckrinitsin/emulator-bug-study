Alright, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user is experiencing an issue with KVM hanging at 100% CPU when using specific command-line arguments to forward ports.

First, looking at the commands provided: when they use separate "-net user,hostfwd=..." arguments, KVM hangs. But when combined into a single "-net user" argument with multiple hostfwd rules, it works fine. So the problem seems related to how the hostfwd options are being handled.

The bug report mentions that using multiple -net user commands causes hanging and connection refusal. Since this is about network forwarding and specifically how KVM processes these parameters, I should consider categories related to networking or device issues.

Possible categories include 'network' and 'device'. The issue doesn't seem to be with the hypervisor itself but rather with how the network interfaces are being managed when multiple port forwards are specified incorrectly.

I think the most appropriate category is 'network' because it directly relates to the handling of network connections and port forwarding in KVM.

The issue relates to incorrect handling of multiple hostfwd parameters, causing networking problems. Therefore, the category is:
