Okay, so the user is having an issue with virt-install getting stuck during the download of install.img. They're using CentOS 6.4 and KVM tools, and everything works up until around 20% when it freezes.

First, I need to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The options are things like mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, etc., including hypervisor.

Looking at the problem, virt-install is a tool used for installing virtual machines. When it's stuck during download, that suggests an issue with how the installation media is being fetched or handled. Since they're using KVM tools and specifying an HTTP location for the ISO, maybe there's an issue related to network connectivity or the way the download is being handled.

But wait, KVM itself is a hypervisor, so if the problem is within the KVM setup or how virt-install interacts with it, that might point towards 'hypervisor'. However, the specific issue here seems more about the installation process and downloading the ISO file. The download could be related to network settings in the virtual machine's configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is with how the Virtio drivers are handling the network, which would still fall under hypervisor components. But considering that virt-install uses the KVM tools to set up the VM, including networking, perhaps it's a problem within the KVM setup itself.

Wait, but looking back at the possible categories, 'network' is one of them. So if the issue is specifically with the download process over the network, maybe it should be categorized under 'network'. But sometimes these issues can also involve how the hypervisor handles certain devices or drivers, especially since Virtio might be involved in handling the network interface.

I'm a bit torn between 'hypervisor' and 'network' here. The problem occurs during the download of install.img, which is part of the installation process. If the issue is with how the virtual machine's networking is set up, it could affect the ability to download the ISO. Alternatively, if KVM isn't correctly configuring the network interfaces, that would point towards 'hypervisor'.

But in this case, since the problem arises during the download phase and relates to the network connection, I think the more specific category would be 'network'. It's possible that there's a misconfiguration or bug in how the hypervisor handles network connections when downloading the ISO image.
