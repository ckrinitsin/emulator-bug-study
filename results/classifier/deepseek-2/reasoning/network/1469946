Alright, I'm trying to classify this bug report. The issue is that a guest OS isn't getting an IP when using a bridge with KVM and QEMU.

First, the environment details: host is x86_64, guest is also x86_64, running Linux as the guest OS. They're using specific commits of kvm.git and qemu.git. The host kernel is 4.1.0, hardware is Ivytown and Haswell processors.

The problem occurs when creating a guest with bridge setup; the guest can't obtain an IP address. Reproduce steps involve using qemu-system-x86_64 with KVM enabled, specifying a virtio-net-pci device connected to a tap network via a script.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue relates to networking since it's about IP assignment when using a bridge. The problem is that the guest isn't getting an IP, which usually points to a networking configuration or setup issue in QEMU/KVM.

Possible causes could be related to how the network devices are configured in QEMU, such as incorrect device settings, missing scripts, or issues with bridging setup. This seems more like a network configuration problem rather than something specific to KVM's hypervisor functions or QEMU's translation of instructions (mistranslation).

Therefore, it falls under the 'network' category because the issue is about network connectivity and IP assignment in the guest.
