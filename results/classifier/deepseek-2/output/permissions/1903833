User mode qemu-aarch: SIGGSEGV signal handler works wrong

I have a user mode qemu-aarch issue. Program with SIGSEGV signal handler works wrong under qemu-aarch: 
once the progam handles the SEGV signal, qemu marks the program's page protected, and signal handler gets SEGV on each subsequent memory access instruction within a program.

The issue is reproduced on WSL Ubuntu 20.04 under Windows 10, qemu-aarch64 version 5.1.50
The issue is also reproducible on the latest upstream qemu-aarch build.

The following workaround disables mprotect call and fixes the issue: https://github.com/BorisUlasevich/qemu/commit/3063d9a64f8395185d65c6b6710d28ee92cd8be5

The issue can be reproduced on OpenJDK which reports SIGSEGV immediately after start. The small reproducer program is attached.
