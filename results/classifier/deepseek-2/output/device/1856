Replay got stuck with consecutive hardware interrupts coming
Description of problem:
I recorded bin file using **_rr=record_** command line. But it got stuck when replaying this record bin file. The icount number would never change after stucking if I typed _**info replay**_ with qmp command line.

I found that the following instructions should be a sequence of consecutive hardware interrupts after stucking once checking the trace log of 
both replay and record log using _**-d in_asm,int**_.
Steps to reproduce:
1.pulling from remote which the newest commit ID is 156618d9ea67f2f2e31d9dedd97f2dcccbe6808c
2.emulating  Windows 7 OS on aarch64 Host with TCG acceleration mechanism
3.using **_rr=record_** to make replay file and tracing guest code and interrupts using _**-d in_asm,int**_
4.replaying the previous file and also tracing guest code and interrupts
