Pressing special keys (specially ctrl) sticks the key or makes it repeat the next key until ESC or Ctrl is pressed.
Description of problem:
Well, I'm using it in a daily basis, since it is my VM to isolate the environment for work.

It was compiled from source for _jack_ support, the only thing that I cared about. I'll be honest : I don't remember the special parameters, nothing unusual though. I'm not in the need for _rt_ kernels.

When I press `Ctrl` and sometimes when I press other special keys, one of the three options occur :
1. It repeats all the keys pressed next, like if I was pressing it for a long time.
    - Example : `a` turns into `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...`(continues)
    - It repeats until I press `Esc` or `Ctrl` again.
1. `Ctrl` continues as pressed and everything I type occurs with `Ctrl`.
    - Example : `a` turns into `Ctrl-A`
    - Probably caused by the previous option.
1. It does what is expected, like `Ctrl-C`
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the specified config.
1. Test `Ctrl-C` + `Ctrl-V` using text editors.
    - I think that using a graphical one is faster to see it happening.
    - Examples
        - Atom
        - Eclipse
        - Kate
        - VsCode
    - It also occurred using a _pty_ but since I generally use the _middle-mouse-button_ with _ptys_.
        - I'm not aware of the frequency that it happens.
    - It also occurs with the mouse (`Ctrl-mouseclick`).
        - For example: instead of going to a _Firefox_'s tab, it selects it.

I don't know any other step here, the use case is trivial coding.
Additional information:
- I have already tried to disable "keyboard repeat" in config.
    - At first it seems to work but the `Ctrl` key can get stuck like in the description and then I'm unable to get out of it (everything is sent as if it was with `Ctrl`) without pressing `Ctrl`+`ESC`. I have no idea of why.
    - The problem seems to occur less frequently.
- It also happened before setting up `qemu-guest-agent`.
