Passthrough USB Host Keyboard doesn't work on Q35 platform on boot-up

Using qemu-kvm as shipped with Ubuntu 16.04, I cannot get a passed-through USB Host Keyboard to work at boot-up using the Q35 platform.

My minimal example to verify this bug is the following:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -M q35 -m 128 -cdrom mini.iso -usb -usbdevice host:04ca:005a -vnc :1 -display none

Using a noname USB Keyboard with ID 04ca:005a and the Ubuntu 16.04 NetBoot mini.iso, I can see the boot screen of the Ubuntu ISO through VNC, but pressing the arrow keys doesn't do anything.

By taking out the "-M q35" parameter, QEMU switches to the traditional i440FX system. The passed-through USB Host Keyboard works there, but the old platform is no option for me.
