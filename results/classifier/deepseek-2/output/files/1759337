'Failed to get "write" lock' error when trying to run a VM with disk image file on an SMB share

This has been reported and discussed downstream:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1484130

but doesn't seem to be getting a lot of traction there.

Basically, with qemu since at least 2.10, you cannot use a disk image on an SMB share that's mounted with protocol version 3 (I think possibly 2 or higher). This is made much more serious because kernel 4.13 upstream made version 3 the *default* for SMB mounts, because version 1 is insecure and should not be used.

So basically, anyone with a recent qemu and kernel cannot use disk images stored on an SMB share. This is a major inconvenience for me because, well, an SMB share is exactly where I store my VM disk images, usually: I have a big NAS drive where I keep them all, only now I can't because of this bug, and I'm manually swapping them in and out of the very limited space I have on my system drive (SSD).

The error you get is:

qemu-system-x86_64: -drive file=/share/data/isos/vms/desktop_test_1.qcow2,format=qcow2,if=none,id=drive-virtio-disk0: Failed to get "write" lock
Is another process using the image?
