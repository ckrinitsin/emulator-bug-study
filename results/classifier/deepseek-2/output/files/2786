deleting files fails on vvfat (was: "error handling renames")
Description of problem:
When working with files, renaming or saving from IDE, QEMU halts with the error message: 

"Error handling renames (-2)"
Steps to reproduce:
1.
2.
3.
Additional information:
a previous del failed, the directories are not synced so the rename on the drive fails when the file with the target file name still exists on the real directory. So the real issue is a failed del.
