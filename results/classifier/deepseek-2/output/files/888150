qemu and qemu.git -> Migration + disk stress introduces qcow2 corruptions

Hi guys, here I am, reporting yet another issue with qemu. This time, it's something that was first reported in January, and Juan proposed a patch for it:

[PATCH 4/5] Reopen files after migration

The symptom is, when running disk stress or any intense IO operation in guest while migrating it causes a qcow2 corruption. We've seen this consistently on the daily test jobs, both for qemu and qemu-kvm. The test that triggers it is autotest stress test running on a VM with ping-pong background migration.

The fix proposed by Juan is on our RHEL branch and such a problem does not happen on the RHEL branch. So, what about re-considering Juan's patch, or maybe work out a solution that is satisfactory for the upstream maintainers?
