Cirrus graphics results in monochrome colour depth at 640x480 resolution

Recently we upgraded to a distribution that bundled QEMU 4.2.0.  We were previously running on QEMU 3.0.0.  When booting Windows 10 VMs on x86_64, users experienced slow, monochrome graphics and the resolution was restricted to 640x480.  Reverting to the prior vgabios-cirrus.bin from the prior source tarball remediated the issue.

An example QEMU command line is below, if needed:
/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -vnc 0.0.0.0:100 -device cirrus-vga,id=video0,bus=pci.0,addr=0x2  -machine pc-i440fx-4.2,accel=kvm,usb=off,dump-guest-core=off -cpu qemu64 -m 2048 -overcommit mem-lock=off -smp 1,sockets=1,cores=1,threads=1 -no-user-config -nodefaults -hda test.raw &
