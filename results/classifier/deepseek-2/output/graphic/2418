[Gfxstream BUG]
Description of problem:
I tried to test gfxstream with qemu,I build qemu-9.0.1 with --enable-rutabaga-gfx flag,but after I have compiled and try to boot my Virtual Devices,it crashed and told me with "invalid rutabaga build parameters: gfxstream feature not enabled"

![å›¾ç‰‡](/uploads/8a979b0808aee2dc173e648d67a46a05/å›¾ç‰‡.png){width=1276 height=99}
Steps to reproduce:
1.Compile the qemu with kvm,vhost,rutabaga_gfxstream,virgl support
2.run the virtual machine with my command

But I found an interesting thing:If I build and install AEMU&Gfxstream at /usr in place of /usr/local,I could boot Virtual Machine normallyðŸ˜‚ 

Could developers solve the problems?Thanks!
