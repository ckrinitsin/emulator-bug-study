A way not to grab keyboards or mice

I set up the window manager to move windows with Alt-Btn1, and to
iconify windows with Shift-Btn1. But since qemu grabs keyboards and
mice, I can't move or iconify the qemu window.

I tried not to grab anything, by inserting return, just beginnig of
ui/sdl.c:sdl_grab_start() as follows:

static void sdl_grab_start(void)
{
    return;
    /*

It is comfortable. I'm glad if you make a way not to grab.
Environment variables, options, etc are welcome.

Current command line is:
QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=pa /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -hda /dosc/win8_x64.img -soundhw hda -boot c -m 2G -cpu Nehalem,+sep -usb -usbdevice tablet -display sdl -rtc base=localtime

qemu version is:
luna:linux % qemu-system-x86_64 --version
