BSD bootloader halts with hypervisor.framework

Guest: FreeBSD 12.0 Install CD
Host: MacOS 11.14.3 qemu master at 90fb864a7df0a9af677352e94f8225f7b03de922

Command arguments:

qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4000m -cdrom Downloads/FreeBSD-12.0-RELEASE-amd64-bootonly.iso

When qemu was run with -accel hvf, the bootloader would halt after showing the menu. The bootloader would not respond to any keyboard events.

Without acceleration option, the bootloader would count down to zero and proceed.
