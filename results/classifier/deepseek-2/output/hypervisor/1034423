Guests running OpenIndiana (and relatives) fail to boot on AMD hardware

First observed with OpenSolaris 2009.06, and also applies to the latest OpenIndiana release. 

Version: qemu-kvm 1.1.1

Hardware:

2 x AMD Opteron 6128 8-core processors, 64GB RAM.

These guests boot on equivalent Intel hardware.

To reproduce:

qemu-kvm -nodefaults -m 512 -cpu host -vga cirrus -usbdevice tablet -vnc :99 -monitor stdio -hda drive.img -cdrom oi-dev-151a5-live-x86.iso -boot order=dc

I've tested with "-vga std" and various different emulated CPU types, to no effect.

What happens:

GRUB loads, and offers multiple boot options, but none work. Some kind of kernel panic flies by very fast before restarting the VM, and careful use of the screenshot button reveals that it reads as follows:

panic[cpu0]/thread=fec22de0: BAD TRAP: type=8 (#df Double fault) rp=fec2b48c add r=0

If there's any more, I haven't managed to catch it. 

Solaris 11 does not seem to suffer from the same issue, although the first message that appears at boot (after the version info) is "trap: Unkown trap type 8 in user mode". Could be related?

As always, thanks in advance and please let me know if I can help to test, or provide any more information.
