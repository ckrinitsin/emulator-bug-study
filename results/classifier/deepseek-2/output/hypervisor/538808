qemu-system-x86_64 0.12.2 crashes with -m 967 under Windows

qemu 0.12.2 and 0.12.3 exit silently under Windows XP when using an -m value higher than 967.  Any value below 967 works fine.  Affects both qemu.exe and qemu-system-x86_64.exe (the only binaries currently available).
qemu 0.12.3 under Linux (Ubuntu 8.10) works fine.
Version 0.9.0 for Windows does not have this problem.  I do not have any other binaries to test.

Command used:
qemu-system-x86_64 -L . -m 967 -hda linux.img -localtime -M pc

There is plenty of available RAM on the host PC (see attached systeminfo).
Not sure what debugging options to use, but will attach whatever is necessary.
