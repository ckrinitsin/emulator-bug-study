Qemu evdev multiple guests/host switch

Hello,

Qemu up to version 3.1

it would be nice if passed through evdev can be switched (using lctrl + rctrl) through all running guests configured for evdev and the host. Currently, only the last started guest and host can be switched only so the previously started guests can't be controlled.
