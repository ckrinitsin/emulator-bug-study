Single-step exceptions incorrectly routed to EL1 when ELD is EL2 (TDE = 1) (qemu version 3.1)

Hi,

I've been encountering issues with QEMU 3.1 when trying to single-step EL1 code, with ELD = EL2 (MDCR_EL2.TDE = 1). I could test with latest commit in a few hours, if you want.

EL1 is Aarch64.

These happen as soon as MDSCR_EL1.SS is set to 1 and ERET is executed:

1) Single-step exceptions are generated even if they should not be (SPSR_EL2.SS = 0)

2) Single-step exceptions are routed to EL1

Exception return from AArch64 EL2 to AArch64 EL1 PC 0x4000005c
Taking exception 1 [Undefined Instruction]
...from EL1 to EL1
...with ESR 0x32/0xca000022
...with ELR 0x4000005c
...to EL1 PC 0x200 PSTATE 0x3c5

EC 0x32 (0b110010) is Exception_SoftwareStepLowerEl.

You can find enclosed minimal code (and resulting .elf) for reproduction.
