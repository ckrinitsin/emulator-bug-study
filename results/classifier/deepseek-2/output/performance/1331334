driftfix=none and migration on Win7 guest causes time to go 10 times as fast

With -rtc base=localtime,clock=host,driftfix=none on a Win7 guest, stopping it with migration and then starting it again about 1 hour later makes the guest time go 10 times as fast as real time until Windows is rebooted.  I have tried qith qemu-2.0.0 and the problem still exists there.
