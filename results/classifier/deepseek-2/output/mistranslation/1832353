cpu_exec: Assertion !have_mmap_lock() failed

Hi,

I have isolated a testcase from the GCC testsuite (actually gfortran, test proc_ptr_51.f90) which produces tons of:

qemu-arm: /home/christophe.lyon/src/qemu/accel/tcg/cpu-exec.c:701: cpu_exec: Assertion `!have_mmap_lock()' failed.

including with master qemu as of today.

I'm attaching a tarball containing:
qemu-assert:
cmd  lib  proc_ptr_51.exe

qemu-assert/lib:
ld-linux-armhf.so.3  libc.so.6  libgcc_s.so.1  libgfortran.so.5  libm.so.6

where cmd is the basic command used to launch the test & reproduce the failure.

Note that the test or the generated may actually be buggy: I have reported failures on native aarch64 and arm machines. Yet, qemu should not fail with a loop of asserts.
