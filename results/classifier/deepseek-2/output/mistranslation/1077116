automoc4 segfaults when building in an armhf pbuilder on an amd64 host

When trying to build kde4libs in an armhf pbuilder created with the pbuilder-scripts running on an amd64 host automoc4 recieves a segmentation fault and I can't get any useful information out of it:

automoc4 runs fine when building on a nexus7 so this sounds like an issue in qemu.
Tested in quantal and raring.
