QEm+Android emulator crashes on x86 host (but not mac M1)
Description of problem:
Using QEmu+Android emulator crashes when using tflite on x86 hosts (but not M1 macs).
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install android toolchain, including emulator (sdkmanager, adb, avdmanager etc)
2. Start android emulator on an x86 host
3. Follow instructions to download and run tflite benchmarking tool [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/measurement)
4. Crashes with the following error

```

```

We have tried with many different models and the result is always the same. The same models run fine when the emulator runs on a mac M1 host.
