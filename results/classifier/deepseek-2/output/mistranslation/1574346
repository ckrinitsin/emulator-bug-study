TCG: mov to segment register is incorrectly emulated for AMD CPUs

In TCG mode, the effect of:

xorl %eax, %eax
movl %eax, %gs

is to mark the GS segment unusable and set its base to zero.  After doing this, reading MSR_GS_BASE will return zero and using a GS prefix in long mode will treat the GS base as zero.

This is correct for Intel CPUs but is incorrect for AMD CPUs.  On an AMD CPU, writing 0 to %gs using mov, pop, or (I think) lgs will leave the base unchanged.

To make it easier to use TCG to validate behavior on different CPUs, please consider changing the TCG behavior to match actual CPU behavior when emulating an AMD CPU.
