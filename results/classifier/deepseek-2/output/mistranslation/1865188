Switching from the monitor to the emulated machine with a French keyboard (AZERTY)

Hi,
I run qemu in an xterm terminal, with TERM=vt100. My keyboard is french AZERTY.

sudo ./qemu-system-hppa -monitor /dev/pts/2 -k fr  -boot d -drive if=scsi,bus=0,index=5,file=../../hpux_11iv1.img,format=raw -serial mon:stdio -D qemu1.log -nographic -m 512 -d nochain -cdrom ../../distri/11iv1/'HP-UX_11iv1_B.11.11_TCOE_September_2005_1of4_Core_OS _Install&Recovery_B6821-10046.iso' -net nic,model=tulip  -net tap

When I want to use the monitor (to change cdrom during the hp-ux installation process), the characters I type are misinterpreted. For example, I enter "2" at hp-ux prompt, I see : "412691;82;22". Impossible to switch from monitor to hp-ux with Ctrl+Alt+1 and Ctrl+Alt+2.

I tried with Debian and Fedora host, TERM=xterm and TERM=vt100, qemu options -alt-grab and -ctrl-grab, -monitor in the same terminal or an other terminal than hp-ux. Nothing works.
Best regards.
