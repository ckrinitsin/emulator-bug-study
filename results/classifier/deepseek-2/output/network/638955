emulated netcards don't work with recent sunos kernel

hi there,

i'm using qemu-kvm backend in version: # qemu-kvm -version
QEMU PC emulator version 0.12.5 (qemu-kvm-0.12.5), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

and there are just *not working any of model=$type with combinations of recent sunos (solaris, openindiana, opensolaris, ..) ..

you can download for testing purposes iso from here: http://dlc-origin.openindiana.org/isos/147/ or from here: http://genunix.org/distributions/indiana/ << osol and oi are also bubuntu-like *live cds, so no need to bother with installing

behaviour is as follows:
e1000 - receiving doesn't work, transmitting works .. dladm (tool for handle ethers) shows that is all ok, correct mode is loaded up, it just seems like this driver works at 100% but ..

rtl8169|pcnet - works in 10Mbit mode with several other issues like high cpu utilization and so .. dladm is unable to recognize options for this kind of -nic

others - just don't work

.. i experienced this issue several times in past .. woraround was, that rtl8169 worked so-so .. with recent sunos kernel it doesn't.

it's easy to reproduce, this is why i'm not putting here more then launching script for my virtual machine:

# cat openindiana.sh
qemu-kvm -hda /home/kvm/openindiana/openindiana.img -m 2048 -localtime -cdrom /home/kvm/+images/oi-dev-147-x86.iso -boot d \
-vga std -vnc :9 -k en-us -monitor unix:/home/kvm/openindiana/instance,server,nowait \
-net nic,model=e1000,vlan=1 -net tap,ifname=oi0,script=no,vlan=1 &

sleep 2;
ip l set oi0 up;
ip a a 192.168.99.9/24 dev oi0;
