assertion failed in exec.c while attempting to start a guest (latest commit)

Hi team,

I decided to try the latest commit on git (previously used version 1.3.0), and I got failed assertions while attempting to start my guests:

eclipse ~ # qemu-kvm -enable-kvm -hda arch.img -m 4096 -smp sockets=1,cores=4 -vnc :0 -cpu host -vga std -net nic,model=e1000,macaddr=00:00:00:00:00:00 -net tap,ifname=vm0 -qmp tcp:0.0.0.0:4900,server,nowait
qemu-kvm: /var/tmp/portage/app-emulation/qemu-9999/work/qemu-9999/exec.c:982: qemu_ram_set_idstr: Assertion `!new_block->idstr[0]' failed.
Aborted

The assertion seems valid, so whatever's causing it is probably to blame. I haven't dug around much to find out what calls the method (qemu_ram_set_idstr()), but that is probably the best place to start.

The host contains a Xeon E3-1240 CPU, virtualising a bunch of guests one of which is Arch Linux 64-bit, if that helps.

eclipse ~ # qemu-kvm -version

It looks like this assertion happens if you call the executable without any parameters as well:

eclipse ~ # qemu-kvm
qemu-kvm: /var/tmp/portage/app-emulation/qemu-9999/work/qemu-9999/exec.c:982: qemu_ram_set_idstr: Assertion `!new_block->idstr[0]' failed.
Aborted

Thanks.
