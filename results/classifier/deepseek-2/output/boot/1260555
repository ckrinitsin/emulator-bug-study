SS-5 emulation doesn't work with Sun boot ROM


The 32-bit SPARC emulator's TCX emulation seems to work with OpenBIOS, but doesn't work with a SparcStation ROM on Cocoa.  Screenshot attached.  Using version 1.7.0 on Mac OS X 10.9 via MacPorts and compiled directly from source, though this problem has carried over from Mac OS X 10.8 and many earlier versions of Qemu.

The following is my Qemu command:

sudo qemu-system-sparc -m 256 -M SS-5 -bios /home/img/ROMs/sun/ss5-170.bin \
  -g 1024x768x24 \
  -drive file=/home/doc/VMs/slagheap/sd0.raw,if=scsi,bus=0,unit=3 \
  -drive file=/home/doc/VMs/slagheap/sd1.raw,if=scsi,bus=0,unit=1 \
  -drive file=/home/doc/VMs/slagheap/sd2.raw,if=scsi,bus=0,unit=2 \
  -net nic,macaddr=DE:EE:DD:FF:EE:DD,model=lance \
  -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=/home/doc/VMs/slagheap/ifup,downscript=/home/doc/VMs/slagheap/ifdown

Note: also can't compile Qemu w/ SDL support from MacPorts on Mac OS X, and config.log is not helpful to figure out why, but this is another issue.
