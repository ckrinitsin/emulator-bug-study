[Qemu-devel] Can I have someone's feedback on [bug 1809075] Concurrency bug on keyboard events: capslock LED messing up keycode streams causes character misses at guest kernel

Hi everyone.
Can I please have someone's feedback on this bug?
https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1809075
Briefly, guest OS loses characters sent to it via vnc. And I spot the
bug in relation to ps2 driver.
I'm thinking of possible fixes and I might want to use a memory barrier.
But I would really like to have some suggestion from a qemu developer
first. For example, can we brutally drop capslock LED key events in ps2
queue?
It is actually relevant to openQA, an automated QA tool for openSUSE.
And this bug blocks a few test cases for us.
Thank you in advance!

Kind regards,
Gao Zhiyuan

There is no "capslock LED key event".  0xfa is KBD_REPLY_ACK, and the
device queues it in response to guest port writes.  Yes, the ack can
race with actual key events.  But IMO that isn't a bug in qemu.

Probably the linux kernel just throws away everything until it got the
ack for the port write, and that way the key event gets lost.  On
physical hardware you will not notice because it is next to impossible
to type fast enough to hit the race window.

So, go fix the kernel.

Alternatively fix vncdotool to send uppercase letters properly with
shift key pressed.  Then qemu wouldn't generate capslock key events
(that happens because qemu thinks guest and host capslock state is out
of sync) and the guests's capslock led update request wouldn't get into
the way.

cheers,
  Gerd
