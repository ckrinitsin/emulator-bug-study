[Bug] "-ht" flag ignored under KVM - guest still reports HT

Hi Community,
We have observed that the 'ht' feature bit cannot be disabled when QEMU runs
with KVM acceleration.
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  --enable-kvm \
  -machine q35 \
  -cpu host,-ht \
  -smp 4 \
  -m 4G \
  -drive file=rootfs.img,format=raw \
  -nographic \
  -append 'console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda rw'
Because '-ht' is specified, the guest should expose no HT capability
(cpuid.1.edx[28] = 0), and /proc/cpuinfo shouldn't show HT feature, but we still
saw ht in linux guest when run 'cat /proc/cpuinfo'.
XiaoYao mentioned that:

It has been the behavior of QEMU since

  commit 400281af34e5ee6aa9f5496b53d8f82c6fef9319

    set CPUID bits to present cores and threads topology

that we cannot remove HT CPUID bit from guest via "-cpu xxx,-ht" if the
VM has >= 2 vcpus.
I'd like to know whether there's a plan to address this issue, or if the current
behaviour is considered acceptable.
Best regards,
Ewan.
