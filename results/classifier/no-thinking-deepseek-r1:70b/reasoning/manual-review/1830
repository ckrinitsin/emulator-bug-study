The issue describes a problem where a command hangs and consumes excessive CPU within a CentOS 7 arm64 container running on an Ubuntu 22 AMD64 host. The hanging process is related to the dynamic linker (`ld-2.17.so`), which suggests that it might be stuck in a system call or experiencing issues with process execution.

Key points:
1. **Command Hanging**: The `LD_DEBUG=all /lib64/ld-2.17.so --list /usr/bin/true` command hangs and takes over the CPU.
2. **Process State**: The process is in state 'R' (Running), indicating it's active but not completing.
3. **Environment Specificity**: This occurs specifically on an AMD64 host running ARM64 containers via QEMU, but not on native ARM64 hardware or Ubuntu 20.04 hosts.

Given that the problem is environment-specific and involves process execution in a cross-architecture setup using QEMU, it likely relates to how system calls are handled in the emulation layer. This points towards issues with system call translation or handling within QEMU.

Therefore, the most appropriate category for this bug report is:

**syscall**

This categorization suggests that the issue lies in how system calls are being managed or translated by QEMU when running ARM64 binaries on an AMD64 host.
