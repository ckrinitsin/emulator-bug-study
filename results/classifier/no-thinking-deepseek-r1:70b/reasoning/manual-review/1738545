The issue arises when running a Go binary compiled with `gccgo-7` on QEMU for ARM architecture, specifically when using `qemu-user`. The error message indicates an "mmap errno 9", which corresponds to "Bad file descriptor". This suggests that there's a problem with how system calls related to memory mapping are being handled within QEMU. Since the same binary works fine on real hardware but fails under emulation, it points towards an incompatibility or misimplementation in how QEMU handles certain syscalls.

Given that the error is tied to `mmap`, which is a system call used for memory management, and considering that this is specific to QEMU's emulation layer, the most appropriate category for this bug would be **syscall**. This categorization aligns with issues related to system calls not functioning as expected within the emulated environment.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Error:** The error message "mmap errno 9" signifies that the `mmap` system call is failing with the error code 9, which translates to "Bad file descriptor".

2. **Understand the Context:** The Go binary works on real hardware but fails when run under QEMU for ARM. This suggests that the issue lies within how QEMU emulates certain system calls.

3. **Categorize the Bug:** Since the problem is directly related to a system call (`mmap`) not behaving correctly in the emulated environment, it falls under the **syscall** category.

4. **Conclusion:** The bug report should be classified as a syscall issue because it pertains to the failure of a specific system call within QEMU's emulation layer.
