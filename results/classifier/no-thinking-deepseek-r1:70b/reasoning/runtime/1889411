The issue describes a problem where GDB cannot unwind the stack when certain signals (like SIGABRT) are triggered while debugging a RISC-V program using QEMU. This appears to be related to how QEMU handles signal delivery and stack unwinding during runtime, rather than a specific instruction or syscall error.
