The issue described involves a significant performance regression when using `qemu-user` and `proot` on Ubuntu 18.04 compared to Ubuntu 16.04. The problem manifests during runtime operations, such as executing a command that takes measurably longer in the newer environment. This suggests that the slowdown is related to how these tools interact during execution rather than issues with specific instructions or system calls.
