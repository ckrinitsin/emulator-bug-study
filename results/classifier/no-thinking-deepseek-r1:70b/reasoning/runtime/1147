The issue describes an assertion failure related to CPU execution in QEMU when running x86_64 binaries on an AArch64 host. This is not tied directly to specific instructions or syscalls but rather to runtime behavior, specifically how QEMU handles CPU state and synchronization mechanisms like RCU (Read-Copy Update). The errors indicate problems during the execution of code that involve concurrency and thread-safety checks.
