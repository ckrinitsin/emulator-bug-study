The issue arises during the compilation of `libvixl` within QEMU on Debian unstable. The compiler is encountering errors in `/usr/include/string.h`, specifically related to missing binary operators and undeclared types like `size_t`. These errors suggest that there might be missing or incorrect headers being included, or a mismatch in compiler settings.

The errors point towards a problem with the build environment's header files or compiler configuration. It does not indicate a faulty instruction or an issue with system calls but rather a problem during the compilation process itself, which is part of the runtime environment setup.
