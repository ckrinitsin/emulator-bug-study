The issue arises from a segmentation fault during runtime when executing a specific binary (`testb3`) using `qemu-riscv64`. The stack trace shows various threads encountering segfaults while handling syscalls and signals, indicating problems during execution rather than issues with specific instructions or system calls themselves. This points to a general runtime error.
