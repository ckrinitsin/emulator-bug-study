The issue revolves around how QEMU's `qemu_getauxval` function handles the `AT_EXECFD` auxiliary vector when its value is zero. Specifically, it incorrectly interprets a valid zero as nonexistent, leading to unexpected behavior where file descriptor 0 remains open and points to the executable. This affects runtime execution, causing programs to read from the executable instead of having standard input closed.

The problem arises during runtime execution when QEMU fails to correctly handle the `AT_EXECFD` value, affecting how file descriptors are managed and leading to incorrect behavior in programs that expect certain file descriptor states.
