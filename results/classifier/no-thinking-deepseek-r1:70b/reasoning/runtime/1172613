The issue lies in how QEMU handles different architectures when running binaries compiled for those architectures. The problem occurs during runtime when QEMU tries to load shared libraries and execute the binary, leading to segmentation faults or incorrect behavior depending on the architecture. This is not related to specific instructions or syscalls but rather to general execution and library loading issues.
