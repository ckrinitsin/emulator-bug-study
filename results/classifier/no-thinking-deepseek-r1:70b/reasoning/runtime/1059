The issue arises during the execution of a Docker image that uses QEMU on macOS. The error message indicates that QEMU encountered an uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted), leading to a core dump. This typically occurs when a process receives a SIGABRT signal, often due to runtime issues such as assertions, fatal errors, or abnormal program termination.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Error:** The error message "qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped" suggests that QEMU received a SIGABRT signal, which is commonly used to indicate an abort or fatal error within the application.

2. **Identifying the Cause:** Since this occurs while using Docker images on macOS with QEMU, potential causes could include:
   - Compatibility issues between QEMU and the underlying system (e.g., macOS).
   - Issues with the specific Docker image configuration.
   - Resource constraints or environment setup problems.

3. **Possible Solutions:**
   - **Check Docker and QEMU Versions:** Ensure that both Docker and QEMU are up to date, as newer versions may resolve known issues.
   - **Review Docker Configuration:** Examine the Dockerfile and container settings for any misconfigurations that could lead to runtime errors.
   - **Inspect System Logs:** Look into system logs (e.g., using `dmesg` or Docker logs) for additional error details that might pinpoint the root cause.
   - **Test on Different Platforms:** Try running the same Docker image on a different operating system to isolate whether the issue is macOS-specific.

4. **Further Diagnosis:** If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the Botfront community or checking their support resources for known issues related to QEMU on macOS.

**Final Thoughts:**
This error points to a runtime issue within QEMU when executed through Docker on macOS. Addressing it likely involves updating software components, adjusting configurations, or seeking community support for platform-specific fixes.
