The issue arises when running an ARM64 Java image on an x86 machine using QEMU. The problem occurs specifically with a newer version of QEMU (2.11.91), where executing `javac` results in a segmentation fault and a core dump, causing the terminal to hang. This behavior doesn't occur with older versions like 2.5.0 or 2.11.1. 

The core dump indicates that there's an unexpected crash happening within QEMU when it tries to emulate certain instructions for ARM64. This suggests that the issue is related to how QEMU handles specific ARM64 instructions, which might not be correctly translated or executed on the x86 host. Therefore, this falls under an **instruction** category bug in QEMU.
