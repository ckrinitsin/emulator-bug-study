The bug report discusses an issue with `qemu-arm-static` where signal handling causes hangs when running Mono and Java in a chroot environment. This is related to how signals are handled during thread termination, specifically involving futex operations and signal routing between threads. The problem occurs at runtime when these applications are executed under QEMU user emulation.

The appropriate category for this issue is:

**runtime**

This classification captures the fact that the bug manifests during the execution of programs (Mono and Java) under QEMU's user-mode emulation, specifically related to how signals and futexes are managed between threads. It does not directly point to a specific instruction fault or a syscall error but rather an issue arising from the interaction of these components during runtime.
