The bug report discusses an issue where a specific PT_LOAD segment in an ELF file causes a segmentation fault when run using qemu-aarch64. The problem arises because the code attempts to zero out memory without checking if it's writable. This is related to how QEMU handles certain segments during runtime, specifically the BSS section.

This falls under **runtime** errors as it's about the program crashing due to an invalid operation (writing to non-writable memory) while executing or loading the ELF file in QEMU.

Answer: runtime
