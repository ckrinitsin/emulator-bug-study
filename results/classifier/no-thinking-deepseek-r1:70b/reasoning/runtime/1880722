The bug report discusses issues related to checking page crossings in the `use_goto_tb()` function across different targets in QEMU. It mentions that some targets like "hppa" have implemented fixes, while others haven't. The workaround involves adding checks for both user and system modes. Additionally, it suggests fixing `linux-user/mmap.c` to handle invalidations properly, which could lead to performance improvements.

The possible categories are:

1. **instruction**: This would apply if the issue was directly related to a faulty CPU instruction or emulation of instructions.
2. **syscall**: This would be relevant if the problem involved errors in system calls or their handling.
3. **runtime**: This category covers other runtime issues, such as memory management, page table handling, or performance problems not tied to specific instructions or syscalls.

Given that the bug pertains to page crossing checks and memory management in `use_goto_tb()` and `mmap.c`, it falls under runtime issues rather than being specifically about an instruction or a syscall. The focus is on how QEMU manages memory and handles translations, which are runtime aspects.

**Answer:** runtime
