The issue revolves around how QEMU handles exceptions when 16-bit Windows programs make DOS calls (e.g., `int 21h`). Specifically, the `sigcontext->trapno` is returning `-1`, which causes WINE to mishandle the exception as an illegal instruction instead of properly patching it for structured exception handling. This points to a problem in how exceptions or signals are managed during runtime.
