The bug report indicates that the user is trying to run an ARM 32-bit binary on an AArch64 system using `qemu-aarch64`, but it fails with an "Invalid ELF image for this architecture" error. The issue arises because the `arm_cpus` array in QEMU is empty, which means there are no defined CPU models for 32-bit ARM architectures when running under AArch64. This prevents the emulation of a compatible ARM CPU (like Cortex-A7), which is necessary to execute 32-bit ARM binaries.

The problem occurs during runtime because the system cannot properly emulate the required architecture to run the binary. It's not an issue with specific instructions or syscalls but rather with the setup and configuration of the QEMU environment for handling different architectures.
