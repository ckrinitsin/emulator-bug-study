The issue arises from how `qemu-user` handles command-line arguments when interacting with `binfmt_misc`. Specifically, when `binfmt_misc` is configured with certain flags (like "P"), it changes the way arguments are passed to `qemu`, leading to unexpected behavior in parsing these arguments. This affects runtime execution within a chroot environment.

The problem is not related to faulty instructions or syscalls but rather to how arguments are processed at runtime, making this a **runtime** issue.
