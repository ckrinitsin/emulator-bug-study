The issue described revolves around GDB's inability to load symbols from dynamically linked shared libraries when connected to a QEMU debug server. This specifically impacts breakpoints in functions like `printf` that are part of these shared libraries. The problem does not occur with native gdbserver, suggesting it's related to how QEMU handles the debugging process.

This falls under **runtime** because it pertains to the execution environment and how GDB interacts with QEMU during runtime, rather than specific instructions or system calls.
