The issue describes a problem where the CI job `build-user-hexagon` is not correctly testing the Hexagon target due to toolchain misconfiguration. The root cause is that the compiler used (`cc`) resolves to a native x86_64 GCC instead of the intended Hexagon cross-compiler (`clang`). This results in the build process compiling for the wrong architecture, leading to failed tests and incorrect behavior.

The problem arises during runtime when the build system (Meson) attempts to execute binaries compiled with the wrong toolchain. This is a **runtime** issue because it pertains to how the application behaves when built with an incorrect configuration, affecting its execution environment.

**Answer: runtime**
