The issue arises during runtime when using `qemu-aarch64-static` to emulate an ARM64 environment on an AMD64 host. The segfault occurs specifically when running `ldconfig.real`, indicating a problem that manifests while executing instructions or interacting with system libraries. This does not point to a specific faulty instruction or a syscall error but rather a general runtime issue within QEMU.
