The issue involves QEMU crashing when writing a core dump after a segmentation fault occurs while running a binary under `qemu-x86-64`. The backtrace shows that the crash happens during `sigsuspend` in the context of handling signals and dumping cores, which suggests it's related to how QEMU manages runtime exceptions and signal handling.
