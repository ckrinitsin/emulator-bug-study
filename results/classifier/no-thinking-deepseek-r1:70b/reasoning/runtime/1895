The bug report describes an issue where `qemu-user` uses a fixed stack size and ignores `RLIMIT_STACK`, leading to segmentation faults when running certain programs like `g++`. This problem is not reproducible on actual hardware, indicating it's specific to the emulation environment provided by `qemu-user`.

Given that this behavior occurs during runtime execution and isn't directly tied to an incorrect instruction or a syscall error, the most appropriate category for this issue is:

**runtime**

This classification captures issues related to the environment in which the code executes, such as resource limitations or constraints imposed by the emulator.
