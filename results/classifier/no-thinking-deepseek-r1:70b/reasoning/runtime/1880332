The issue involves a segmentation fault occurring under specific conditions when using QEMU 5.0.0 for user emulation with a cURL binary on an aarch64 architecture, particularly when connecting to a server using TLS 1.2 and ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 cipher. The presence of a Dockerfile that reproduces the crash and strace outputs with and without a specific commit reverted suggests it's related to runtime behavior rather than a syscall or faulty instruction.
