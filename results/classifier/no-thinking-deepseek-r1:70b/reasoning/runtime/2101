Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is using QEMU to run an x86_64 binary (ls) on an AArch64 platform, but they're getting incorrect results when listing the root directory with '-l'. 

First step: They copied /usr/bin/ls and its dependent shared libraries from an x86_64 system to an AArch64 machine. That part seems okay; cross-compiling or copying binaries for different architectures is a common practice.

Then, they're using qemu-x86_64 with the -L option pointing to the path where the x86_64 libraries are located. The command looks correct on the surface: 

qemu-x86_64 -L /path/to/x86_64/lib/root/dir  /path/to/ls  /  -l

But when they run this, instead of getting a proper directory listing with details (-l), something's wrong. 

Possible issues to consider:

1. **Shared Libraries**: Are all the necessary shared libraries correctly copied and accessible? Maybe some dependencies are missing or not properly linked.

2. **Path Resolution**: Is QEMU correctly resolving the paths for the shared libraries when it runs the ls command? The -L option should handle this, but perhaps there's a misconfiguration.

3. **Binary Compatibility**: Ensure that the binary is indeed compatible with the target system. Even though they copied from x86_64, maybe some system calls or library versions differ.

4. **Permissions and Environment**: Check if permissions are correct for the libraries and binaries. Also, environment variables might be affecting QEMU's behavior.

5. **QEMU Version**: Could be a bug in the specific version of QEMU they're using. Maybe updating to a newer version would resolve it.

6. **Debugging**: Running with strace or adding verbose flags might provide more insight into what's going wrong during execution.

Given that the command structure seems correct, the most likely culprit is either a missing library or an incorrect path setup leading QEMU to not properly emulate the environment needed for the x86_64 ls binary. If all dependencies are correctly in place and paths are accurate, it might point towards a bug within QEMU's handling of system calls or library emulation.

After considering these points, the issue seems related to how QEMU is handling the runtime environment, specifically with shared libraries or path resolution during execution. Therefore, categorizing this under 'runtime' makes sense since it relates to errors occurring when the program runs rather than incorrect instructions or syscall issues.
