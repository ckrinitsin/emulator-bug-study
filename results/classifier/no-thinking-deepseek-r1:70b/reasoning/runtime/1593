The issue here revolves around how QEMU's SLIRP implementation handles network binding when using the `hostfwd` option. The user expects that specifying a particular bind address (like `127.0.0.1`) would limit the listening socket to only that interface. However, due to the use of `INADDR_ANY`, the application ends up binding to all available interfaces (`*.*`), which is not the intended behavior.

This problem arises from within the code logic of QEMU's SLIRP module, specifically in how it interprets and applies user-provided network settings during runtime. It doesn't pertain to faulty instructions or incorrect system calls but rather to a logical error in the application's handling of configuration parameters.

**runtime**

The issue is categorized under "runtime" because it relates to how QEMU executes and handles network configurations during its operation, rather than being an instruction-level fault or a syscall error.
