The issue arises from how QEMU's PL011 UART implementation handles byte writes to specific SFR (Special Function Register) offsets. When writing a byte, it incorrectly modifies the entire register instead of just the targeted byte. This problem occurs in runtime when executing certain operations without compiler optimizations.
