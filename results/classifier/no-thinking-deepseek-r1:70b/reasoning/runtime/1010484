The user provided a bug report related to slirp not allowing non-local DNS servers and mentioned that this is part of qemu. They also specified possible categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The task is to classify it.

First, I need to understand the context. Slirp is a userspace TCP/IP implementation often used in QEMU for networking. The issue here is about DNS server configuration constraints.

The bug report talks about removing a check that prevents using non-local DNS servers. This doesn't seem to involve a faulty instruction or a syscall error directly. Instead, it's about runtime behaviorâ€”specifically, how the application (slirp) handles DNS configurations during execution.

So, categorizing this under "runtime" makes sense because it's about the application's behavior and constraints during operation, not about incorrect instructions or system calls.

**Answer: runtime**
