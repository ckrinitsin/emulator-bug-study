The issue arises from how QEMU handles memory addresses during user-mode emulation when translating guest instructions into host code. Specifically, it misinterprets two different 64-bit guest addresses as the same due to their lower 32 bits being identical, leading to incorrect memory accesses and data retrieval.

This problem is related to **instruction** handling in QEMU's translation process.
