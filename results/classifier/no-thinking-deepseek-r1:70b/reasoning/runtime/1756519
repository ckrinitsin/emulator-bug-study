The issue arises during the execution of a multi-threaded test case when using qemu's linux-user mode for RISC-V64. The crash occurs in QOM (QEMU Object Model) path canonicalization during a `do_fork()` call that invokes `cpu_create`. This suggests a problem related to object lifecycle management or property setting in QOM, which is part of the runtime environment.
