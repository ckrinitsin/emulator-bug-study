The issue arises during runtime when running a program compiled for `aarch64_be-linux` using `qemu-aarch64_be`. The error message indicates an unreachable code path in `gdbstub.c`, which suggests a problem in how QEMU handles debugging stubs or system emulation at runtime. This doesn't directly point to an instruction or syscall issue but rather to a general runtime problem within the emulator.
