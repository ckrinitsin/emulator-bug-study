The bug report mentions that using `clang 17` and newer with the `-fsanitize=function` flag causes QEMU user-mode to crash due to a segmentation fault when calling TCG prologue. This issue occurs during runtime execution, specifically related to function sanitization features affecting the TCG (Tiny Code Generator) component of QEMU.

Given that this is an error occurring at runtime rather than being directly tied to a specific instruction or system call, it falls under the "runtime" category.
