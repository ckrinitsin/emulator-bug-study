The issue arises from QEMU's ELF loader making an incorrect assumption about the relationship between virtual addresses and file offsets in PT_LOAD segments. This leads to a miscalculation when handling certain binaries, causing a segmentation fault. The problem is related to how QEMU processes ELF files during runtime, specifically in its loader logic.
