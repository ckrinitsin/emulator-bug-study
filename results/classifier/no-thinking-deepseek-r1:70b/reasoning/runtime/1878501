The issue arises because `qemu-i386` does not define the `AT_SYSINFO` auxval when running i386 Linux binaries, leading to a segmentation fault due to an invalid function pointer being called. This problem occurs at runtime when executing specific binaries compiled against certain versions of Bionic libc.
