The issue arises when running certain x86_64 binaries on an aarch64 host using qemu-x86_64-static from qemu-8.1.3-1.fc39. The error message indicates that qemu is unable to find a suitable guest_base for address mapping, specifically mentioning the ranges 0000000000000000-0000000000000fff and 0000000000400000-00000000004047ef. This suggests a problem with how QEMU handles address mappings during runtime.
