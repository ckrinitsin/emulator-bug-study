The issue arises during the execution of a binary compiled for ARM Cortex-M3 using qemu-arm in linux-user mode. The error message indicates an assertion failure related to memory address limits. This points to a problem occurring at runtime when QEMU tries to set page flags, which is unrelated to specific instructions or system calls.
