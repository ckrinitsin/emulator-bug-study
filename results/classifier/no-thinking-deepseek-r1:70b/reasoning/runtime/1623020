The issue arises from running an amd64 binary on an ARM7 host using QEMU. The program crashes due to panic messages related to the Go runtime, such as "panic before malloc heap initialized" and "gentraceback before goexitPC initialization." These errors indicate problems with how QEMU handles system calls required by the Go runtime for initialization.

The stack traces and panics suggest that the issue is not with specific instructions or a particular syscall but rather with how the runtime environment is set up. Therefore, this falls under the **runtime** category as it pertains to the execution environment and runtime initialization issues within QEMU when emulating an amd64 binary on an ARM7 host.

**Answer:** runtime
