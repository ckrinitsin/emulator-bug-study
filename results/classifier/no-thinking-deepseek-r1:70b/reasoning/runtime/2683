The issue revolves around `probe_access()` behaving inconsistently between full-system and linux-user modes when the flag is set to `TLB_MMIO`. This affects memory operations and callback injections, leading to differing behaviors such as those observed in RISC-V's `cbo.zero` implementation.

The problem occurs during runtime execution, specifically related to how memory accesses are handled under different QEMU modes. Therefore, it falls under the **runtime** category.
