The issue arises from compilation errors related to C11 atomic operations in the `util/async.c` file when using clang. Specifically, the compiler complains that the address arguments for atomic operations are not pointers to `_Atomic` types, which is a requirement for C11 atomics.

This problem is related to incorrect usage of atomic operations and thus falls under **instruction** errors because it pertains to how the code is written and compiled rather than runtime behavior or system calls.
