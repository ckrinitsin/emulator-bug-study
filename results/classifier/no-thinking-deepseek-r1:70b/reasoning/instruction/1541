The bug report describes an issue with the placement of `G_NORETURN` in the code when using clang++ 15.0.7. The problem arises during compilation, specifically related to how attributes are used in the code. This is a compile-time error rather than a runtime error or an issue with instructions or syscalls.

The error message indicates that the attribute list (from `G_NORETURN`, which expands to `[[noreturn]]`) cannot appear where it was placed. The compiler does not accept the syntax as written, leading to a build failure. This is strictly a compile-time issue and does not involve runtime behavior or system calls.
