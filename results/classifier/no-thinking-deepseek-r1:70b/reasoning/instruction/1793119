The issue described involves incorrect behavior of floating-point operations when emulating AArch64 on QEMU compared to real hardware. The problem specifically occurs with the `fdiv` instruction when FPCR is set to zero. This points to a flaw in how QEMU handles the emulation of the `fdiv` instruction, which falls under the category of an instruction-level issue.
