The bug report discusses an issue where a SIGILL signal is generated due to an invalid shift instruction (RLDICL) being produced by QEMU's translation process when constant folding is enabled for subtraction operations during the emulation of PPC64LE instructions on x86_64 architecture.

**Category: instruction**

This categorization fits because the problem arises from an invalid or incorrectly generated machine-level instruction, specifically related to a shift operation. The bug report details how the faulty instruction causes a crash and ties it directly to QEMU's handling of constant folding during translation, which is part of the instruction processing logic.
