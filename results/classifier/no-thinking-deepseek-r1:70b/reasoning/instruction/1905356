The bug report discusses an issue where QEMU does not properly handle unaligned data access for certain ARM32 instructions, leading to incorrect behavior that violates the ARM documentation. Specifically, it points out that instructions like LDRD and STRD should raise alignment faults when accessing unaligned addresses but do not in QEMU. This falls under issues related to instruction handling.
