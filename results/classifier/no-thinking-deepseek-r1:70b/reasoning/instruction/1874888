The issue involves certain programs causing QEMU to crash due to a "tcg fatal error" and an assertion failure related to `have_mmap_lock()`. The provided code snippet and additional examples execute custom bytecode that seems to trigger this behavior in both QEMU 4.2.0 and 5.0.0-rc4 versions when run using either the -user or -system variants.

Analyzing the error message:
1. **tcg fatal error**: This indicates a problem within QEMU's Tiny Code Generator (TCG), which is responsible for translating guest machine code into host code.
2. **cpu_exec(CPUState *) assertion failure**: The assertion `!have_mmap_lock()` failing suggests an issue with how memory mappings or locks are handled during execution.

The code snippets provided contain various x86-64 instructions, including some that involve SIMD operations (like `vpmovzxbd`, `vroundps`, etc.), which might be interacting incorrectly with QEMU's TCG.

Given that the crash occurs when executing specific machine code instructions and is reproducible across different versions of QEMU, it points to a problem in how certain instructions are being handled or translated by the TCG. This suggests the issue lies within the instruction translation or execution logic rather than syscalls or general runtime errors.

The bug appears to be related to faulty or incorrectly handled instructions within QEMU's TCG translator, leading to fatal errors during execution.
