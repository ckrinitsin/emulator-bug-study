The issue involves an unexpected change in the value of the RAX register after executing specific assembly instructions. The problem seems to stem from how the instructions are being handled, possibly due to incorrect encoding or decoding of the instruction, leading to an unintended modification of RAX. This points towards a fault in the instruction itself.
