The issue revolves around the use of an atomic test-and-set instruction in the spinlock implementation within PostgreSQL/Greenplum when run under QEMU user emulation for ARM64. The problem does not occur on physical ARM64 hardware but arises specifically within the emulated environment provided by QEMU. This suggests that there is a malfunction or misbehavior in how QEMU handles the specific instruction used for the test-and-set operation, which is crucial for the spinlock functionality.

The bug report indicates that the spinlock mechanism fails under QEMU, leading to timeouts and PANIC errors. Since this behavior does not manifest on physical hardware, it points towards an issue with how QEMU emulates the instruction rather than a flaw in the instruction itself or the operating system's syscalls. Therefore, the problem is classified as an issue related to an instruction.
