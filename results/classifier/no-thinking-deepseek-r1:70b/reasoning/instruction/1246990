The bug report indicates that running rjsupplicant under QEMU results in a segmentation fault. The stack trace points to an issue in `static_code_gen_buffer()`, which is related to instruction generation within QEMU's CPU emulation. This suggests a problem with how instructions are being handled or generated, rather than a system call error or other runtime issues.
