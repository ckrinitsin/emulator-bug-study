The issue involves an "Illegal instruction" error when running a binary under QEMU, but not when using GDB for remote debugging. This suggests that the problem is related to how specific instructions are being executed by QEMU. Since the binary works correctly with GDB and only fails in QEMU, it points to a potential bug in QEMU's handling of certain instructions.

The ELF file header indicates that the binary is an ARM executable, and QEMU version 4.0.0 is being used. The error occurs during runtime execution by QEMU but not under GDB. This pattern suggests that there might be an issue with how QEMU emulates or processes specific ARM instructions.

Given these details, the problem falls under the category of **instruction** issues within QEMU.
