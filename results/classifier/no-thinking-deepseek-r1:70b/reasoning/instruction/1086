The issue arises when running NumPy/SciPy test suites under QEMU emulation on ppc64le but not on aarch64. The failures indicate problems like array values being garbage, permuted, or fundamentally different (e.g., zero vs non-zero), which suggest issues in how floating-point operations are handled during emulation.

These symptoms point to errors in the translation of instructions, particularly those involving floating-point arithmetic, rather than system calls or general runtime issues. Therefore, the category is:
