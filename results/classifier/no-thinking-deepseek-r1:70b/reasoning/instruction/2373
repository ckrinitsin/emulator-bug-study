The bug report describes an issue with the FMOPA/FMOPS widening instructions in QEMU's AArch64 implementation. Specifically, it mentions that these instructions incorrectly handle floating-point conversions when the FZ and FZ16 flags are set, leading to wrong results. The problem lies within the instruction execution logic of the emulator.
