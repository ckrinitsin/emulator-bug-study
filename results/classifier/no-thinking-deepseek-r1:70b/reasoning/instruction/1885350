The issue reported pertains to the RISC-V dynamic rounding mode not updating correctly when the `frm` value changes while `rm=7`. The code in QEMU's `gen_set_rm` function checks if `ctx->frm == rm` before updating, which prevents the rounding mode from changing even when `frm` is modified. This behavior contradicts the RISC-V specification, leading to incorrect rounding during floating-point operations.

The problem occurs at runtime when executing instructions, making it a **runtime** issue.
