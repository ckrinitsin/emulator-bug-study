The bug report describes an issue where a binary contains an illegal instruction following a `jal` instruction in RISC-V64 baremetal emulation. The problem arises because after executing the `jal`, the next instruction is illegal, leading to an exception. This is related to how instructions are handled during execution.

**instruction**

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Understanding the Issue**: The binary has an illegal instruction immediately after a `jal` (jump and link) instruction. Normally, the `jal` should redirect control flow, but in this case, the next instruction is being executed instead of taking the jump.
   
2. **Identifying the Category**: Since the problem involves the execution of an illegal instruction and how the `jal` is handled, it falls under issues related to instruction handling.

3. **Categorization**: The categories provided are "instruction," "syscall," and "runtime." This issue clearly pertains to instruction execution, not system calls or general runtime errors.

**Answer:** instruction
