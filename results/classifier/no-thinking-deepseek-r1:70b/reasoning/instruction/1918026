The issue involves incorrect simulation of RISCV64 32-bit AMOs (Atomic Memory Operations). The problem arises from the use of `tcg_gen_atomic_fetch_<op>_tl` instead of `tcg_gen_atomic_fetch_<op>_i32`, leading to incorrect behavior in atomic operations. This directly relates to how specific instructions are implemented and handled within QEMU.
