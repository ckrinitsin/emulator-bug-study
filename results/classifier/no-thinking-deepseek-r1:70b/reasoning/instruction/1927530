The issue arises from HWAddressSanitizer detecting a SEGV signal instead of a tag mismatch when running under qemu-aarch64. This points to a problem in how memory access is being handled or reported, likely due to an incorrect implementation or handling of memory tagging in QEMU's MTE (Memory Tagging Extension) support.
