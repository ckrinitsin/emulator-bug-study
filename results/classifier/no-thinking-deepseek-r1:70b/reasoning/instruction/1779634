The issue described involves running x86_64 binaries on an aarch64 platform using QEMU's user-mode emulation. The key problem is the "Synchronous External Abort" error, which typically occurs due to invalid memory accesses or incorrect instruction execution.

This error is related to how QEMU handles instructions during emulation, particularly when translating x86_64 instructions for the aarch64 architecture. It suggests that there might be a bug in the way certain instructions are being emulated or translated.

The category of this bug falls under "instruction" because it pertains to issues with executing or translating specific instructions, leading to an abort.

**Answer:** instruction
