The issue describes a problem related to the handling of the 'bkpt' instruction within QEMU when using ARMv7 LPAE. Specifically, it points out that during a prefetch abort exception caused by a 'bkpt' instruction in user space, the IFSR register's bit [9] (which is supposed to indicate long-descriptor format usage) isn't set correctly. This affects how exceptions are processed and reported, leading to incorrect output when debugging or handling such exceptions.

This bug is tied directly to an issue with a specific CPU instruction ('bkpt') and its interaction with the ARM architecture's exception handling mechanisms. It doesn't relate to system calls (syscall) nor general runtime errors but rather to how a particular instruction behaves under certain conditions in the emulator.
