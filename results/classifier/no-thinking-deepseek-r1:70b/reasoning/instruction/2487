The issue arises from changes in how QEMU's TCG (Tiny Code Generator) handles certain instructions for x86_64 targets, specifically related to testing bits and partial registers. This leads to unexpected code paths being reached during execution, causing the crash. The problem is tied to instruction generation and handling within the TCG component.
