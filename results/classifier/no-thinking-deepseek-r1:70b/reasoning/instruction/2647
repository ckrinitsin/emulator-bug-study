The issue lies within the conditional judgment where `acc_flag` is checked against `PAGE_WRITE`, but based on the earlier code, `acc_flag` can only take the values `PAGE_WRITE_ORG`, `PAGE_READ`, or `PAGE_EXEC`. This means comparing it to `PAGE_WRITE` directly will never be true and likely leads to unintended behavior in memory access handling. This is an example of a faulty instruction.
