The issue arises from an illegal `exts` instruction encountered while running a MIPS N32 executable under QEMU. The problem is traced back to the dynamic linker (`ld.so.1`), where the `exts` instruction causes an exception. This indicates that either the instruction is not correctly handled by QEMU's emulator for the MIPS N32 architecture or there is an incompatibility in the instruction set implementation.
