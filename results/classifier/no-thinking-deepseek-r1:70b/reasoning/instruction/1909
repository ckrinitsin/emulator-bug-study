The issue involves a segmentation fault occurring when incrementing a gcov counter in QEMU 8.0.0 but not in version 6.2.0. The problem seems to be related to how instructions are handled, specifically the `str x8, [x9, #2512]` instruction which causes a segfault. This points to an issue with the instruction execution rather than syscalls or general runtime errors.
