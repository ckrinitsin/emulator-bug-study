The issue mentions random errors occurring on `aarch64` when executing `__aarch64_cas8_acq_rel`. This indicates a problem at the instruction level since it involves a specific CPU architecture and an atomic compare-and-swap operation, which is a low-level instruction. Therefore, this falls under the **instruction** category.
