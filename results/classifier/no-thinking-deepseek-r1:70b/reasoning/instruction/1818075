The issue arises because QEMU's TCG (Tiny Code Generator) does not support certain AVX instructions that are being used by the code built with -march=skylake and -mavx2 flags. The warnings indicate missing support for various CPU features, including AVX and AVX2, which are required to execute the AVX instructions correctly. As a result, when the program attempts to run these unsupported instructions, it hangs indefinitely. This problem is related to the execution of specific instructions that QEMU's TCG cannot handle.
