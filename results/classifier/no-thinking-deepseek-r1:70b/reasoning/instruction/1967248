The issue described involves an uncaught target signal 5 (Trace/breakpoint trap) when running a binary under QEMU, but not when using GDB. The user also mentions that QEMU's 32-bit ARM Linux-user mode does not correctly handle BKPT instructions by converting them into SIGTRAP signals.

**Analysis:**
- The problem revolves around the handling of BKPT (breakpoint) instructions in QEMU.
- Specifically, it appears that QEMU is not properly translating these instructions into the appropriate SIGTRAP signal, which is crucial for debugging purposes.
- This misbehavior leads to a core dump when running the program normally but works as expected under GDB.

**Classification:**
This issue pertains to how QEMU processes specific ARM instructions (BKPT). Therefore, it falls under the **instruction** category.
