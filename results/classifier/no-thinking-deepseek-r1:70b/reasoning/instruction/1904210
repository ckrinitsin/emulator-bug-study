The issue involves an uncaught target signal SIGILL (Illegal Instruction) while the program has registered a handler for it. This is related to how QEMU handles signals during execution, specifically when an illegal instruction occurs.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The binary registers a handler for SIGILL.
2. When an illegal instruction is executed at address 0x10A68, the handler should be invoked.
3. In QEMU version 2.5.0, this works as expected, and the program continues execution.
4. In QEMU version 2.11.1, instead of invoking the handler, QEMU crashes with an "uncaught target signal" error.
5. This indicates a regression or bug in how QEMU handles signals in newer versions.

The problem is classified under **instruction** because it pertains to handling illegal instructions and signals during program execution.
