The bug report describes an issue where `open("/proc/self/exe", ...)` returns a closed file descriptor when using qemu-user. This happens because the file descriptor is closed during initialization by `load_elf_image()`. The problem arises from how QEMU handles the `AT_EXECFD` auxval and the subsequent behavior of `do_openat`, leading to incorrect file descriptors being returned.

This issue is related to system calls, specifically how `openat` behaves in this scenario. Therefore, it falls under the **syscall** category.
