The issue revolves around a problem with how QEMU's user-mode emulation handles vDSO calls for clock_gettime() on ppc64le architectures. Specifically, when using Go 1.12 and above, which switched to using vDSO for these calls, there is a malfunction in time-related functions like NewTicker() and Sleep(). This suggests that the problem lies within QEMU's emulation of system calls related to timing functions.
