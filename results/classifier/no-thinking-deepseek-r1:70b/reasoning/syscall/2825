The issue revolves around the `execveat` system call when using an empty filename and the `AT_EMPTY_PATH` flag across different architectures. This specifically affects non-x86 architectures like ARM64, ARM, and RISC-V, where it returns `ENOENT`. The problem is tied to how QEMU handles system calls, particularly in user emulation mode, and how it interacts with the binfmt_misc mechanism. This points directly to a problem within the QEMU implementation of system call handling for non-native architectures.
