The bug report describes an issue where calling `setreuid()` or `setegid()` from x86_64 user-mode code causes QEMU to crash due to improper handling of signal mechanisms related to NPTL (Native POSIX Threads Library). The problem arises because the necessary setup for these calls is not correctly handled in QEMU, leading to a segmentation fault. Specifically, the `__xidcmd` variable remains null, indicating that the required memory region for the signal handlers was not properly initialized.

This issue relates directly to how system calls are emulated or handled within QEMU. The crash occurs during the execution of these specific syscalls due to missing or incorrect initialization of structures needed by the NPTL library. Therefore, this is categorized under `syscall`.
