The bug report indicates that certain thread-related system calls (set_robust_list and clone) are unimplemented in the Nios2 user-mode emulation within QEMU. These unimplemented syscalls cause failures when running specific tests, such as those related to TLS (Thread-Local Storage). The issue directly pertains to missing or incorrect implementations of system calls required for thread operations.
