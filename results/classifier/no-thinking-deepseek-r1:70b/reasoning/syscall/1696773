The issue involves goroutines (threads) and repeated calls to `exec`, which cause a segfault under ARM user emulation but work natively. This points to an error in how system calls are being handled during emulation, particularly when multiple threads are involved. The problem is likely related to the `exec` system call not functioning correctly within QEMU's environment.
