The issue revolves around how signals are handled during the `pselect` system call within QEMU. The program expects to catch `SIGUSR1` when it's unmasked during `pselect`, but under QEMU, this doesn't happen even though the signal is delivered. This indicates a problem with how QEMU emulates or handles system calls related to signal delivery and processing.
