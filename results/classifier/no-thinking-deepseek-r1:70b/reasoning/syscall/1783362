The issue revolves around `mmap` returning an incorrect value when `len == 0`. This directly relates to how system calls are emulated in QEMU for different architectures (x86_64 and ARM aarch64). The problem occurs specifically with the `mmap` system call, which is misbehaving under certain conditions. Therefore, this falls under the category of a syscall error.
