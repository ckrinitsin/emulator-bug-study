The issue lies in how QEMU handles system calls, specifically the `openat()` system call when accessing `/proc/self/auxv`. The problem arises because the length of the auxiliary vector is not being correctly calculated or passed, leading to an empty file being returned. This directly relates to a bug in the implementation of system calls within QEMU.
