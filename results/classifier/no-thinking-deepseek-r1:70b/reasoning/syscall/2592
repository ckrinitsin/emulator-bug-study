The issue occurs when running Python under `qemu-aarch64`, specifically with functions from the `time` module like `time.time()`. The error is an `OSError`, which suggests it's related to system calls or interaction with the operating environment. Since the problem doesn't occur on native aarch64 machines but does with QEMU, and similarly works fine with `qemu-arm`, this points to a potential issue with how QEMU handles certain syscalls for AArch64. Therefore, this is likely a syscall-related problem.
