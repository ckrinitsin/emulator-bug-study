The issue occurs when using `qemu-i386` and `qemu-x86_64` to run a program that calls `system()`, but it works correctly with `qemu-arm` and `qemu-mips`. This suggests that the problem is specific to how system calls are handled in QEMU for x86 and x86-64 architectures. The fact that the same code works on ARM and MIPS implies that the issue lies within the emulation of system calls for Intel-based architectures rather than a general problem with the `system()` function itself or the cross-compilation process.

The error occurs during runtime when executing the `system()` call, indicating that it's related to how QEMU emulates system calls. Therefore, the category best fitting this issue is:
