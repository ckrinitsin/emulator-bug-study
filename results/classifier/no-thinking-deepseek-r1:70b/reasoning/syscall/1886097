The issue revolves around how QEMU and Linux handle the calculation of the initial program break for ELF binaries, specifically regarding segments with different permissions. The discrepancy arises because QEMU's method for determining `info->brk` considers only segments with write permissions (PROT_WRITE), while Linux sets it based on the highest virtual address of any loadable segment, regardless of its flags. This mismatch leads to incorrect program break values in QEMU, causing runtime crashes when binaries are executed.

Given that this problem pertains to how system calls are handled and calculated within QEMU's emulation layer, particularly concerning the `brk` system call, it falls under the category of a **syscall** issue.
