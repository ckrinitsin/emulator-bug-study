The issue arises from using `qemu-arm-static` to emulate ARM on an x86_64 host and encountering an "E000075" error when trying to access a directory via Subversion (SVN). The specific error message indicates that a value is too large for the defined data type. This suggests that there's a mismatch in how data types are handled between the emulated ARM environment and the host system.

The problem likely stems from the way `qemu` handles system calls during emulation, particularly those related to file operations. When interacting with the filesystem through SVN, certain system calls might not be correctly translated or handled by `qemu`, leading to type mismatches that cause the error.

Therefore, this issue falls under the **syscall** category because it relates to errors in how system calls are managed during emulation.
