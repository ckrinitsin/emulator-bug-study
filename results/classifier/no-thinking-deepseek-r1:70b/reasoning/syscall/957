The issue revolves around an unexpected error from the futex facility, which is related to system calls (syscalls) involving thread management and synchronization. The error occurs during Python interpreter rebuilds under QEMU emulation, specifically when multiple threads interact using futex operations. The logs show that futex calls are returning "Invalid argument" errors, leading to the crash.

Since this pertains to errors in system call handling and interaction with kernel primitives (futex), it falls under the **syscall** category.
