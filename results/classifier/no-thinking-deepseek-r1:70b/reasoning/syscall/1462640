The issue revolves around the `shmat` system call failing when running a 32-bit guest program on a 64-bit host using QEMU. The problem arises due to differences in memory mapping flags between 32-bit and 64-bit environments. Specifically, the 32-bit guest program uses `MAP_PRIVATE` for `mmap`, which conflicts with the `shmat` call that requires shared memory mapping (`MAP_SHARED`). This indicates a problem with how system calls are handled in QEMU, particularly related to memory management.
