The issue involves how `qemu-arm` handles the `QEMU_LD_PREFIX` environment variable when executing a program. When listing the contents of `/`, it incorrectly remaps the root directory to the path specified by `QEMU_LD_PREFIX`. This behavior suggests that there's an error in how system calls are being handled, particularly with the `openat` syscall which is used to open directories.
