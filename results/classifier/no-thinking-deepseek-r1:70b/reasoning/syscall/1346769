The issue revolves around how QEMU handles system calls, specifically in the context of the `/proc/self/maps` content for 32-bit guests on a 64-bit host. The problem arises because certain targets (like ARM, M68K, and UNICORE32) have specific handling for stack boundaries that other architectures do not, leading to Asan failing to find stack boundaries when running 32-bit binaries under QEMU. This points to an error in how system calls are implemented or handled.
