The issue arises because the Go runtime doesn't use the `CLONE_SYSVMEM` flag when calling `clone`, which is required for proper process creation under certain environments like QEMU's linux-user mode. This problem is specifically related to how system calls are handled in the context of creating new OS threads, which falls under the category of **syscall** errors.
