"-device help" does not report all devices

-device help doesn't report all devices.
E.g., devices that are instantiated by a board don't get printed in part because they don't exist when "-device help" is processed. As an experiment I deferred processing of "-device help" as long as possible and some devices were still not printed, so there's more going on here.

QEMU commit hash: 944fdc5e27a5b5adbb765891e8e70e88ba9a00ec

Repro:
$ configure --target-list=arm-softmmu
$ make
$ ./qemu-system-arm -device help | grep npcm7xx
<empty>

I'd expect to see things like npcm7xx-rng in the output.

I can imagine enumerating board-provided devices is a challenge.
Still, it'd be really nice if "-device help" printed them, and having
"-device $driver,help" work as well.

This works as intended, see Markus' reply here:
