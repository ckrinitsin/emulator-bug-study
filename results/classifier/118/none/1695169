qga fail to start when pidfile path is missing

The qga main program has two parameters: "--logfile" and "--pidfile" which specifies the paths to the logfile and pidfile. It assumes that the paths exit in the running OS but if not, the qga will fail to start.I think qga should create the missing paths.

I found this bug exits in several Linux distributions including Ubuntu 14, Cent-OS 6 and 7 when the original and the latest master qga applies. I have a patch which can fix it. Should I patch it to the QEMU master branch?

Patches should be sent to the qemu-devel mailing list for discussion and inclusion. Did you ever send your patch to the list?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
