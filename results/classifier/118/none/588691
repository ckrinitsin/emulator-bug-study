QEMU is not correctly detecting host CDs

QEMU's block layer contains code for detecting and using ioctls when real CD-ROM host devices are attached.

This detection is not working in some host OSes while bad implemented on anothers.

E.g., in Linux host qemu -cdrom /dev/sr0 is not detecting it as a CD-ROM
E.g., in Mac OS X host qemu asks the kernel to enumerate optical devices and the compares it to the constant string "/dev/cdrom". This is useless, that enumeration is just enough, and "/dev/cdrom" will NEVER exist in Mac OS X unless manually created by the user.

The linux /dev/sr0 issue should be fixed upstream:

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/qemu.git/commit/?id=3baf720e6b920d583ce2834d05e5a4e9603a1d56

Maybe it's worth a backport to stable

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?


I use real CD-ROM disc in Mac OS and Windows guests on my Mac OS 10.12 host. I have to run QEMU in root mode using the sudo command in order to access the CD-ROM drive. So I know QEMU's support for using real optical media on Mac OS hosts does work. 

OK, thanks for the confirmation, John, so seems like this bug has been fixed in the past and we can close it now.
