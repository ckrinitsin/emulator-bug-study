Win98SE glitches RHEL6.2/CentOS6.2 QEMU

I'm not sure if this is something anyone will be interested in,
but I ran into some glitches setting up a Windows 98 SE
QEMU VM with a relatively recent version.  Needed this
to restore an ancient backup and got it working well
enough to get the job done.

Versions
========

Distro: CentOS 6.2

Kernel: upstream 3.1.8

QEMU:
gpxe-roms-qemu-0.9.7-6.9.el6.noarch
qemu-img-0.12.1.2-2.209.el6_2.1.x86_64
qemu-kvm-0.12.1.2-2.209.el6_2.1.x86_64

Glitches:

1) Doesn't work in KVM mode, screen goes black
just after installer is finishing up and switching to
Win98.  Saw this issue has been around for awhile.

2) Got it working in QEMU mode, but BIOS plug-n-play
driver fails.  This prevents other devices from working.

a) CDROM not recognized

b) Realtek 8139C driver (installed separately after
Win98) not recognized.

I don't need these issues fixed, just reporting the
in case it's of interest and/or helpful.  Can provide
more detail on request.

QEMU 0.12 is pretty much outdated nowadays - can you still reproduce these issues with the latest version of QEMU?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
