NVME is missing support for mandatory features through "Get/Set Feature" command

The following are features which are marked as mandatory by the 1.2 specification (NVMe 1.2, Section 5.14.1, Figure 108) as currently not implemented
 - 0x1 Arbitration
 - 0x2 Power Management
 - 0x4 Temperature Threshold
 - 0x5 Error Recovery
 - 0x6 Interrupt Coalescing
 - 0x7 Interrupt Vector Configuration
 - 0x8 Write Atomicity Normal
 - 0x9 Asynchronous Event Configuration

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
