-nodefaults has unclear documentation

-nodefaults has an unclear documentation, I believe it should states it does not applies to devices created by a machine model.

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52908614/qemu-s-nodefaults-not-working-as-expected-to-me to read how I came to this.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
