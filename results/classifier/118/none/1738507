qemu sometimes stuck when booting windows 10

I am using qemu-2.10.1, or actually libvirt, to create a virtual machine, running microsoft windows 10 pro operating system.
It installed fine and was actually working, however sometimes when trying to boot the vm, the whole boot process gets stuck.
For some reason, it seemed to happen only when enough physical memory is taken so that, when booting a windows vm that has 4gb of available ram, host starts swapping some other processes. It is not always happening there, but often it happens, and I do not remember seeing any case of this happening when not swapping, maybe a kind of a timing issue?
When this happens, I usually try to hard reset the machine by libvirt reset command or equivalent system_reset on qemu monitor, however the whole reset does not happen, and the command is a noop. That makes me think it is a qemu bug, not windows refusing operation. At the time of this event, qemu monitor and spice server are working correctly, are not stuck, and even doing things like system reset does not result in a monitor hang. It is also possible to quit qemu normally.
I tried to workaround the bug by guessing what may cause it. Switched from bios to uefi, changed virtio-scsi to ahci temporarily, and disabled virtio-balloon in case it would be buggy, with no visible change.
I will attach a libvirt log, because it contains qemu command line. I will also attach an example qemu backtrace.
From what i know, both vcpu threads are working normally, at least none of them is stuck in a vcpu, nor deadlocked, etc. So backtrace could be different each time I tried to get it.





The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
