fstrim not working with image mounted to path?


guest os: windows server standard 2016
qemu agent version 100.0.0

os supports trimming
path mounted image does not support trimming

C:\Users\Administrator>fsutil behavior query disabledeletenotify
NTFS DisableDeleteNotify = 0
ReFS DisableDeleteNotify = 1


[@ ~]# virsh qemu-agent-command vps-xxx '{"execute":"guest-fstrim"}'
{"return":{"paths":[{"path":"C:\\"},{"path":"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Mailbox\\xxxx\\","error":"The given volume path is invalid. (0x89000001)"}]}}


Looks like the fstrim does not like/check images mounted on a path? Nor detects if image trimming is supported. xxxx is a ReFS mounted image without trimming support. 

If I enable trimming on the ReFS image, and configure it win2016, the result is still the same.


C:\Users\Administrator>fsutil behavior query disabledeletenotify
NTFS DisableDeleteNotify = 0
ReFS DisableDeleteNotify = 0

[root@c03 ~]# virsh qemu-agent-command vps-xxx '{"execute":"guest-fstrim"}'
{"return":{"paths":[{"path":"C:\\"},{"path":"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Mailbox\\xxxx\\","error":"The given volume path is invalid. (0x89000001)"}]}}

PS. tried this on a win 2016 std server with just one fs, no problems then.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
