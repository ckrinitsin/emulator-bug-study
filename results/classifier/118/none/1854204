Menu is not clickable on OSX Catalina

1) Run `qemu-system-x86_64`
2) Try to click on the main menu

Menu is not clickable until another window is activated and QEMU window is activated again

Does this reproduce on earlier pre-Catalina OSX versions, or is it Catalina-specific?

This is probably not going to be addressed unless somebody wants to investigate and write a patch for it -- OSX support in QEMU is only very barely maintained.


Catalina-specific. It also affects several UI toolkits. This workaround https://stackoverflow.com/a/7602677 seems to help.

Thanks for the research. That looks like an OSX bug to me -- the simple two-line set of operations to do this that previously worked now needs some horribly complicated multi-stage sequence, and the first suggested workaround is doing something strange involving the Finder and a 0.1 second delay which I am definitely suspicious of. Apple should fix their OS to stop breaking applications :-)

The second suggested approach is essentially to add:
 
    SetSystemUIMode(kUIModeNormal, 0);
    [NSApp activateIgnoringOtherApps:YES];

which for us probably would want to go before the [NSApp run] (or at least after we've created the sharedApplication).

It's a bit odd also that the stackoverflow question says this only happens "if you don't call [TransformProcessType] early enough", because QEMU calls that about as early as it is feasibly possible to do, very near the top of main() in cocoa.m.


The workaround on SO was posted way back in 2011. It has initially solved a different issue, I think.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


Still a bug.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
