-device usb-host failing with usbip_vudc-vhdi_hcd gadget

I must admit that I do not know if this is a Qemu or a Kernel issue, but I try reporting here:

When I try to forward a copy of my USB mouse that I made with the new virtual USB device controller in kernel 4.7 I get the following in my log:
[  +0.703256] usb 1-4: reset full-speed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd
[  +1.020776] usb usb7-port3: Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?

[  +0.855005] usb usb7-port3: Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?
[  +0.000009] usb usb7-port3: unable to enumerate USB device

the commands I use for makeing the virtual device are(after making a copy of the report description of my real mouse in /root/usb/kingston_report_desc):
        mkdir /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/winmouse
        cd /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/winmouse
        echo "0x047d" > idVendor
        echo "0x1020" > idProduct
        mkdir strings/0x409
        echo 2016 > strings/0x409/serialnumber
        echo Kensington > strings/0x409/manufacturer
        echo "Kensington Expert Mouse" > strings/0x409/product
        mkdir configs/c.1
        mkdir configs/c.1/strings/0x409
        mkdir functions/hid.usb2
        echo 2 > functions/hid.usb2/protocol
        echo 1 > functions/hid.usb2/subclass
        echo 4 > functions/hid.usb2/report_length
        cat /root/usb/kingston_report_desc > functions/hid.usb2/report_desc
        echo 0xa0 > configs/c.1/bmAttributes
        echo 100 > configs/c.1/MaxPower

        ln -s functions/hid.usb2 configs/c.1
        echo usbip-vudc.2 > UDC

        usbip attach -r localhost -d usbip-vudc.2

The virtual mouse then shows up as Bus7,Dev10 and I use the option -device usb-host,hostbus=7,hostaddr=10,id=hostdev6,bus=usb.0,port=2 in Qemu to attach it.

This is Qemu 2.7.0 on kernel 4.7.4

Error in title, was supposed to say:
-device usb-host failing with usbip_vudc-vhci_hcd gadget

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
