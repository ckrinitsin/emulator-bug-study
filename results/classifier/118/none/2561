Sound doesnt work on debian guest + debian host using Pipewire
Description of problem:
There is no sound on Debian Stable VM. Im using SPICE for audio redirection.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download debian stable ISO (12 atm)
2. Install it on your KVM
3. Make sure your host and your guest are using pipewire (check https://wiki.debian.org/PipeWire#Installation)
4. No sound is transmitted to the host.
Additional information:
- I have tried switching SPICE to something else like ALSA, but it will result in hanging of the video page similar to this video: 

https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1698#issuecomment-1031376517

- Tried to use direct pipewire, but resulted into error:

```
Error starting domain: internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: 2024-09-04T18:13:40.241754Z qemu-system-x86_64: Unknown audio driver pipewire'. Perhaps you want to install qemu-system-gui package?

Yes i have installed "qemu-system-gui" but still got the same message.
