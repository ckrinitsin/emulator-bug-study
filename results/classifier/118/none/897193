virtfs: kernel compile fails

I am trying to compile a kernel under virtfs, and am getting an error.  The error does not occur when compiling outside of the virtfs mount.

Both guest and host are running the 3.0.4 kernel.
QEMU is latest from git: bc75c9e50d308b2ec6623a40179c5cdc84b63dae

QEMU command line:
/usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -boot c -m 1024 -machine type=pc,accel=kvm -drive file=/root/hdd1.img,if=virtio -drive file=/root/test1.img,if=virtio -drive file=/root/test2.img,if=virtio -virtfs local,path=/mnt/virtfs,security_model=none,mount_tag=virtfs -net nic,model=virtio,macaddr=DE:AD:BE:EF:AA:BB -net tap,ifname=qtap0,script=no

virtfs line in /etc/fstab:
virtfs                  /mnt/virtfs             9p      defaults,noauto,trans=virtio    0 0

Steps to reproduce and output:

[root@guest linux-3.0.4]# make mrproper

  CLEAN   scripts/kconfig
  CLEAN   include/config include/generated
  CLEAN   .config .config.old

*** Default configuration is based on 'x86_64_defconfig'

*** Error during update of the configuration.

make[1]: *** [silentoldconfig] Error 2
make: *** No rule to make target `include/config/auto.conf', needed by `include/config/kernel.release'.  Stop.


Please let me know if you need any other information.  Thanks!

Hi Avishay,

Are you running qemu as a normal user? In that case, could you please check whether normal user has rw access to the kernel source?

Also could you please attach the output of strace scripts/kconfig/conf --silentoldconfig Kconfig ?

Hi,

I am running qemu as root.

The output from strace for the command that you requested shows that this is the problem:
rename(".tmpconfig.h", "include/generated/autoconf.h") = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

The command fails because the directory 'include/generated' doesn't exist because I ran only the command you mentioned, and not 'make'.

So I attached the output for: strace -f make &> /tmp/strace.out

Hope that helps, and thanks!

Triaging old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
