qemu-kvm: -no-reboot option broken in 12.x

When using the "-no-reboot" qemu option with kvm, qemu does nothing and immediately exits with no output or error message.   If I add the --no-kvm option to the command line, it works as expected.

It works fine in 11.0 and 11.1, but I tested all versions of 12.X, and they all have this problem.

There is no QEMU version 11.x or 12.x, so I assume this ticket is rather meant for the Ubuntu QEMU package

Please give the output of:

which qemu
dpkg -l | egrep -e "(qemu|kvm)"
cat /etc/*-release


[Expired for qemu-kvm (Ubuntu) because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
