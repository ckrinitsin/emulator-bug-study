I'm sorry, but the QEMU project only supports the two most recent versions of macOS (see https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/build-platforms.html#macos ), i.e. everything that is older than macOS 10.14 is not supported anymore.

OK, thank you for pointing that out.

Question, can you help me identify the most recent release/tag/commit that I could back up to which would support Mac OS X 10.11.6?

Thank you!

Best regards, 

Robert Ball


Hmm, let's see ... the work-arounds for old Mac OS X versions have been removed here:

https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=483644c25b932360018

It mentiones that this commit has broken compilation earlier:

https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=50290c002c045280f8d

... so the newest version that still might be compilable is v4.0.

Fantastic.   Thank you Thomas, greatly appreciated!

Best regards, 

Robert Ball
