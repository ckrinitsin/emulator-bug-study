 Raspberry Pi 4 qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0xffff87709b0e

Hello,

I have a Raspberry Pi 4 with an ESXi hypervisor installed on it (ESXi ARM Edition).
I created a CentOS 7 VM on it and I'm using a Docker container which is running qemu inside it.

This container is a Debian Bullseye OS and I'm using qemu-i386 to start my application inside it.
The error given by qemu is the following :

qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0xffff9d5f9b0e
qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0xffff82f29b0e

(The pc= value is always different, I guess it is randomly generated).

My qemu version is : qemu-i386 version 5.1.0 (Debian 1:5.1+dfsg-4+b1)

Could you please help me? Why am I facing this error?

Feel free to ask any questions regarding this matter in order to find a solution to it!

Regards

What's the application you are trying to start? Is it publicly available?

Hello,

I'm trying to start a TeamSpeak 3 Server inside my Docker container.
Yes, this application is publicly available on the developer website and is free to install and use.

Feel free to ask more question or test in other to resolve this matter.

Thank you.

Hello,

Can I get any help please?

Thank you.

Regards,

If you run QEMU with the '-d unimp' option (if that's awkward, set the environment variable QEMU_LOG to 'unimp' instead) does QEMU print any messages about unimplemented functionality? (In https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1619896 somebody else was trying to run TeamSpeak 3 Server, which fails because of some unimplemented parts of the Linux syscall API in QEMU, but it doesn't actually crash apparently.)


Hello,

If I do as mentionned this command: qemu-i386 -d unimp ./ts3server 

I get this output :

(Forget about the system local WARNING.)

I attached the generated core dumps, if that helps. I don't have other logs to add.

Thank you for your help!

Regards,






If you can't see the core dumps, provide me with a file hoster where I can upload them. They are around 180mb each.

Feel free to ask more test to find a solution to this matter.

Thank you!

Hello,

I would really appreciate if anyone could confirm that someone is actually taking a look at this case.

If you need more information / test, again feel free to ask!

Regards,

Hello,

For you information using a Debian 10 distribution resolve the problem. 
I don't know why but using a CentOS 7 distribution cause this error "qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0xffff82f29b0e"

You can close this case if you want, but still I guess it's worth investigating why this error is showing up while using CentOS rather than Debian ...

Regards,

Sorry, apparently nobody got a clue what might have gone wrong here (or simply not enough spare time to look at this issue), but since it's working for you now with a different distro, I'm closing this ticket now.
