qemu-nbd -r -c taints device for subsequent usage, even after -d

Something about qemu-nbd -r -c /dev/nbd0 someimg leaves cruft behind - subsequent connections get marked readonly.

This is on quantal, haven't checked precise or raring.

To demonstrate:
# use one image
qemu-img create -f qcow2 /tmp/1.qcow2 100M
sudo qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd2 /tmp/1.qcow2
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nbd2
sudo qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd2
# use a second one on the same nbd device, shows that reuse works:
qemu-img create -f qcow2 /tmp/2.qcow2 100M
sudo qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd2 /tmp/2.qcow2
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nbd2
sudo qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd2
# connect an image in read only mode
sudo qemu-nbd -r -c /dev/nbd2 /tmp/2.qcow2
sudo dumpe2fs /dev/nbd2 | head -n 3
sudo qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd2
# now try to reuse in read-write mode again:
qemu-img create -f qcow2 /tmp/3.qcow2 100M
sudo qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd2 /tmp/3.qcow2
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nbd2
# here it goes boom:
mke2fs 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)
/dev/nbd2: Operation not permitted while setting up superblock
# still need to cleanup
sudo qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd2

Happens on Precise as well.

Quick code read - I think that this block:
    if (flags & NBD_FLAG_READ_ONLY) {
        int read_only = 1;       
        TRACE("Setting readonly attribute");
            
        if (ioctl(fd, BLKROSET, (unsigned long) &read_only) < 0) { 
            int serrno = errno;
            LOG("Failed setting read-only attribute");
            return -serrno;
        }   
    }       

in nbd.c should be
    {
        int read_only = 0;
        if (flags & NBD_FLAG_READ_ONLY)
            read_only = 1;
        TRACE("Setting readonly attribute");
        if (ioctl(fd, BLKROSET, (unsigned long) &read_only) < 0) { 
            int serrno = errno;
            LOG("Failed setting read-only attribute");
            return -serrno;
        }   
    }       


http://paste.ubuntu.com/1352684/ is a debdiff, uploading the source format 3 patch as well





Fixed patch - I had my sense inverted... http://paste.ubuntu.com/1352711/ 

Thanks, this still applies upstream as well.

To some extent it is a bug in the upstream kernel, which doesn't reset state properly. However, the qemu patch is also good. Thanks!

Thanks, Paul, I'll cherrypick commit c8969eded252058e90e91f12f75f32aceae46ec9 into the ubuntu packages

This bug was fixed in the package qemu-kvm - 1.2.0+noroms-0ubuntu4

---------------
qemu-kvm (1.0+noroms-0ubuntu14.6) precise-proposed; urgency=low

  * Fix qemu-kvm.upstart: just don't run in a container.  Otherwise we'll
    still try to load/unload kernel modules.  Also undo the || true after
    sysfs writes.  Since setting those is a part of configuring qemu-kvm
    on the host, failing when they fail makes sense.

qemu-kvm (1.0+noroms-0ubuntu14.5) precise-proposed; urgency=low

  * add udev to qemu-kvm Depends to ensure that postinst succeeds.

According to comment #9 this bug has been fixed by this commit here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=c8969eded252058
... so I think it should be OK to close this bug now.
