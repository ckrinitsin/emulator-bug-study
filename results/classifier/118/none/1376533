Copyright year should be updated in vl.c

When specifying '--version', qemu prints the version along with 'Copyright (c) 2003-2008'. 

Some users may think that it hasn't been updated since 2008, so the end year in version() in vl.c should probably be updated around the start of each new year.

Found in the qemu-2.1.2 source tarball.

This has been fixed a while ago already, so setting the status to "Fix released" now.
