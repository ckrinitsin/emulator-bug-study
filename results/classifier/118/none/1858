Block device read operation misses one byte(8 bit) per chip per SPI transaction
Description of problem:
Block device Micron m25qu02gcbb (hw/block/m25p80.c) is emulated by the two -drive files. For block device read operation, device driver from Windriver vxWorks issues SPI commands. For read SPI command( 0x6b ) from device driver, there is a data length to be read is specified. For each SPI command call, m25p80_transfer8(SSISlave *ss, uint32_t tx) from hw/block/m25p80.c is called and read byte is returned to guest OS. It is observed that for more than one sequential SPI read commmands, first byte from the next read block is not returned back to guest OS. Traces within m25p80.c shows that all the data bytes are read however, first byte from the next read block is missing at guest OS.
 
drive file content: 0x0 0x1 0x2 0x3 0x4 0x5 0x6 0x7 0x8
SPI read command is set to read 4 bytes in one transaction, two transactions are needed from guest OS to read the entire  data.
trace_m25p80_read_byte() shows that all bytes are read at m25p80_transfer8() call.
At guest OS following is received: 0x0 0x1 0x2 0x3 0x5 0x6 0x7 0x8 (Missing first byte of the second transaction, 0x4)
Additional information:
Windriver is a proprietary OS so I can't attach the .bin files. However, any other guest OS should be able to demostrate this behavior. guest OS device driver is reading without errors on an actual Micron QSPI device.
