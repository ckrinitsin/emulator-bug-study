guest userspace process core dump after raspi2 kernel boot

Host info:
==========
x86-64, Ubuntu 18.04, QEMU 4.0.0 (downloaded tarball from main site)

Guest info:
===========
ARM7l, Raspbian OS off the main raspberry pi site

QEMU command:
=============
qemu-system-arm -M raspi2 -kernel bootpart/kernel7.img -dtb bootpart/bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb -drive file=2019-07-10-raspbian-buster.img,format=raw,if=sd -append "rw earlyprintk console=ttyAMA0,115200 fsck.repair=yes rootwait memtest=1 loglevel=8 dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2" -serial stdio

kernel7.img and bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb were obtained by the following commands:

guestfish --ro -a 2019-07-10-raspbian-buster.img -m /dev/sda1
><fs> copy-out / bootpart/
><fs> quit

Output:

The core dump error can occur at both times, before logging in and after logging in, in this case I have given the output after logging in to show the initial processes running.

Also please let me know if I using any kernel flags incorrectly

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
