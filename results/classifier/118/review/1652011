VM shuts down due to error in qemu block.c

On a Trusty KVM host one of the guest VMs shut down without any user interaction. The system is running:

We investigated to see if this is a known issue and came across a bug report for Fedora (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1147398), but nothing references changes upstream that fix this.

The guest OS is Ubuntu Precise (12.04.5) running kernel linux-image-3.2.0-101-virtual 3.2.0-101.141. There wasn't any significant load (CPU or IO) on the guest at the time that it shut down and there wasn't any appreciable disk IO on the KVM host either. The disks for the guest are on the KVM host box.

Please do not report distribution specific bugs (since you're using qemu-kvm 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.27) against the QEMU project bugtracker - use the distribution's bugtracker instead.

Status changed to 'Confirmed' because the bug affects multiple users.

Description of problem:
VM Guests occasionally hard shutdown unexpectedly with error: 

"qemu-system-x86_64: block.c:2806: bdrv_error_action: Assertion `error >= 0' failed."

In my environment it only appears to be my Windows 2008R2 guests that are affected, although I know of another environment with SLES guests that are affected.  As per email here: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-discuss/2014-06/msg00094.html


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
  
  * qemu-system-x86-1.6.2-5.fc20.x86_64

How reproducible:

It is difficult to reproduce, it occurs roughly once a week each Guest VM for me.


Additional info:
  * I am running Openstack Icehouse on Fedora 20 (via packstack)
  * Kernels: kernel-3.14.4-200.fc20.x86_64 / kernel-3.14.8-200.fc20.x86_64
  * libvirt-1.1.3.5-2.fc20.x86_64
  * Guest OS: Windows 2008R2
  * Guest VirtIO driver version 0.1-81
  * Guest Storage is via NFS export from a Netapp FAS 6220 cluster.
  * These unexpected shutdowns do not occur for me at busy times for either the guests or the hosts.

*** Bug 1147398 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

bdrv_error_action is called from 3 places.  What is going to
help most of all here is a stack trace.  Easiest thing is
to enable core dumps and make sure the core dump is captured when
qemu fails.

Thanks for the idea. Sounds better than mine to recompile qemu with debug messages. Can you give  a hint how to achieve it in an OVirt/libvirt environment.

I met this problem with qemu-1.6.1 too, while my problem is found at debian7 guests.

This message is a reminder that Fedora 20 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 20. It is Fedora's policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version'
of '20'.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 20 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.

Since F20 is EOL soon, closing this. If anyone can still reproduce with F21+, please reopen and I'll take a look

We see this in upstream openstack CI testing, viewable here:

This is a volume-backed VM. I think around the time that this fails, we should be trying to plug a virtual interface.

For comment 7, this is mitaka openstack.

libvirt version: 1.2.2

QEMU 2.0.0

Ubuntu 14.04 for the compute host.

If you are hitting this on ubuntu, you need to file an ubuntu bug.
