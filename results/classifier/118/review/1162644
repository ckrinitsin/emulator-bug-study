qemu-system-x86_64 crashed with SIGABRT in __assert_fail_base()

Description:
When QEMU tries to boot with a usb 3.0 tablet (xhci) on a Raring ringtail box (QEMU package1.4.0+dfsg-1expubuntu4)  it will crash soon afterwards:

qemu-system-x86_64: /build/buildd/qemu-1.4.0+dfsg/hw/usb/core.c:552: usb_packet_setup: Assertion `p->iov.iov != ((void *)0)' failed.

Component:
qemu-system -> 1.4.0+dfsg-1expubuntu4

Ubuntu Version:

Description:	Ubuntu Raring Ringtail (development branch)
Release:	13.04

Steps to reproduce it:

I met this bug while running the virt-test suite

https://github.com/autotest/virt-test

Instructions to install and run it can be seen on the README file

https://github.com/autotest/virt-test#readme

After the suite is set, it can be reproduced on a raring (13.04) simply by running:

./run -t qemu --tests usb.usb_reboot.usb_tablet.xhci

Command line:

Thanks for reporting this bug, I will try to reproduce it, and check whether upstream git head has the same bug.

I can't reproduce this on a clean raring system, which has the same qemu version as your quantal system.

Is it possible for you to test on a clean raring system?

What is your libvirt package version?

It doesn't get any cleaner than this. I've installed the box with 12.10, immediately followed by upgrade to 13.04. What seems to be going on is that the issue is not 100% reproducible (I tried today with the same setup and could not reproduce it).

Moreover, what really matters here is the qemu/kernel version, and nothing else.

Libvirt version is 1.0.2-0ubuntu10. I did compile the latest git master and so far I could not reproduce it either.

I could just reproduce it on Fedora 19 qemu-kvm version (which is 1.4.0) and qemu.git master. So the issue is not 100% reproducible, but it can be seen on qemu.git master and therefore, downstream packages such as the ones found on Ubuntu and Fedora, for example.

Ok, thanks - i did run it 3 or 4 times.  How often would you say it fails for you?

I will mark this as affecting the upstream qemu project based on comment #10.

On my F19 box, it's failing about 2/3 of the attempts. What is funny is that on the Ubuntu 13.04 box, I can't get the problem reproduced anymore, for some reason beyond me.

Status changed to 'Confirmed' because the bug affects multiple users.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Sure, please close it.
