claims temp file is used by another process

QEMU emulator version 2.12.50 (v2.12.0-12378-g99a34dc4d2-dirty)

"c:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe" -net none -parallel none -bios OVMF.fd -L . -hda fat:rw:image
vvfat image chs 1024,16,63
c:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe: -hda fat:rw:image: Could not open 'C:\Users\tsiros\AppData\Local\Temp\qem5B92.tmp': The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.

someone please delete this

@tsiros, can you explain why this isn't an issue for you anymore? This is precisely what happens to me, specifically when I create drives as `file=fat:rw:path/to/dir`. When I type `fat:path/to/dir`, everything works fine, though I get some warnings. Was this fixed in newer versions or did you simply realized some issue on your side? Thanks.

Hi there! Our fork of QEMU still happens to have this issue. Did you happen to find a solution?

$ ../orbital-qemu/ps4-softmmu/qemu-system-ps4 -bios ./ubios.bin -kernel ./boot.img -drive file=hdd.qcow2 -drive file=fat:rw:sflash/,media=disk -monitor stdio -smp 8 -display orbital
vvfat sflash/ chs 1024,16,63
C:\tools\msys64\home\Alex\orbital\orbital-qemu\ps4-softmmu\qemu-system-ps4.exe: -drive file=fat:rw:sflash/,media=disk: Could not open 'C:\tools\msys64\tmp\qem1DF0.tmp': The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.

I can't remember at all!

i am sorry i know how frustrating this is

i don't remember even if i fixed it or if i gave up

Is this still reproducible with the latest version of QEMU, or could this ticket be closed nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
