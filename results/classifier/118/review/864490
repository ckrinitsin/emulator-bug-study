Windows 2008 x64 (SBS Server) freezes randomly when using more than 1 CPU core

This issue has been giving headache to us since a long time.
Difficult to reproduce as it happens randomly.
We had this issue when we ran Windows 2008 x64 or Windows SBS Server guests in either XEN 3.3 or Proxmox environments.
When only one CPU core is assigned to the guest, everything is fine. If 2 or more cores are assigned, the guest stops responding after several hours - and in the host machine one of the cores is using 100%. The only thing that helps is resetting the guest.

I am ready to provide logs/crashdumps if needed, because we want to help resolve this issue. I saw some posts on the web of people having the same problems - for some of the workaround was to fix some BIOS settings, but we did not have success with those (e.g. disabling C1E Support and Intel C-State )

Server is running on Intel® Core™ i7-920 Quad-Core, 24 Gig RAM.

Hi,

Is this bug tracker active or I posted to the wrong place?

thx

Since nobody replied here within the last years: I think you should rather report problems with XEN / Proxmox to the XEN or Proxmox bugtracker instead.
