Windows 98 doesn't detect mouse on qemu and SeaBIOS.

A windows 98 guest doesn't detect mouse on recent qemu. I bisected and the result is

fd646122418ecefcde228d43821d07da79dd99bb is the first bad commit

    Switch pc bios from pc-bios to seabios

    SeaBIOS is a port of pc-bios to GCC.  Besides using a more modern tool chain,
    SeaBIOS introduces a number of new features including PMM support, better
    BEV and BCV support, and better PnP support.

Running 10.04 beta on three different machines and on all the Win95 guest ps2 mouse emulation does not work.

I also confirm from Lubuntu 10.04 beta2.
Win98 on qemu doesn't detect mouse.
The sound also doesn't works.
I used the same image on Ubuntu 9.04 and it worked.

I confirm that mouse is no more detected from version QEMU-0.12  running a Windows 3.1 on XP-PRO
In fact mouse seems to be "detected" (arrow is present and there is no warning message about lack of mouse) but the arrow doesn't move. (I created a new install with QEMU-0.12.3)

I confirm another time on Ubuntu 10.04 stable.
Win98 doesn't detect mouse.
Also the audio doesn't work !

I confirm this same bug appears in Windows 95, Windows Me and several XFree86 and X.Org versions, as well as DOS based Microsoft Mouse drivers.

I confirm also that mouse is not detected on Kubuntu 10.04 running qemu and Windows 98.

I did find a workaround - I removed the BOCH BIOS package and QEMU package from my Lucid Install, and instead used the respective QEMU packages from 8.04 - this worked for me.  I don't know if the most recent updates to the BIOS and QEMU packages will fix this or not - I might not try until I get confirmation that the new 10.04 packages are working.  

Apologies if I'm spamming this venue - truly just trying to be of assistance.  Just got done installing the new updates to packages 
 qemu bochsbios qemu-kvm seabios vgabios - still did not fix the failure to recognize the mouse.  

this is fix for other mouse-stuck problem, or maybe the same.

SeaBIOS 6.0 solved problem for me.

Yes! Using SeaBIOS 6.0 worked for me as well. Thanks LightBit. I've been waiting for this for quite a while.

Looks to be fixed by

Looks like this is fixed in qemu.

Im using Mint 19.3 based on Ubuntu 18.04 with QEMU 2.11 from repository, keyboard is working but mouse not in Win98.
  
  Could someone else to restest it?
