trace-root.h is not regerenerated after re-configure

Hi,

I've just realized that after I reconfigured my qemu with
../configure --target-list=arm-softmmu,arm-linux-user,aarch64-softmmu,aarch64-linux-user --enable-trace-backends=simple

$ make
did rebuild some stuff for the 'simple' trace, but it did not update trace-root.h until after I
$ make clean


I took me while to understand why I didn't get the traces I wanted (my trace-root.h still thought it was configured for the default 'log').

I didn't check how easy it is to fix this in the build system.

Thanks

Thank you for reporting this.  I have sent a patch to fix the makefile.
