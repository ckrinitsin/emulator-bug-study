Host OS Reboot Required, for Guest kext to Load (Fully)

Hi,

Finding this one a bit odd, but I am loading a driver (kext) in a macOS guest ... and it works, on the first VM (domain) startup after a full / clean host OS boot (or reboot). However, if I even reboot the guest OS, then the driver load fails => can be "corrected" by a full host OS reboot (which seems very extreme).

Is this a known issue, and/or is there a workaround?

FYI, running,
QEMU emulator version 5.0.0 (Debian 1:5.0-5ubuntu9.1)
Copyright (c) 2003-2020 Fabrice Bellard and the QEMU Project developers

This is for a macOS guest, on a Linux host.

Thanks!

Hi! Seems like you're using the QEMU from your distro, so should this be a bug report against Ubuntu's QEMU instead? Otherwise, can you please try again with the latest upstream version of QEMU (currently an RC of v5.2)? You certainly also need to provide more information, e.g. what kind of error message do you see, how often did you try (maybe it's just an intermittent problem and it sometimes also works without rebooting the host), etc.

Sure, will do (upstream version). Is there a preferred way to do it? Meaning ... build locally, or install from some repository?

Thanks!

The QEMU project only provides the source tarballs, so builing locally is certainly the preferred way to test.

That makes sense, no issue at all. So I cloned from git (v5.2.0-rc3), built, installed. All good so far :-). But then I tried to modify the "emulator" in virt-manager, point to this build => I get the error,

Error changing VM configuration: internal error: Failed to start QEMU binary /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 for probing: libvirt:  error : cannot execute binary /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64: Permission denied

Thoughts? I have run into this before (without finding a fix sadly) - thinking it's apparmor related somehow?

Thanks!

Sorry for the delay on updating this - but pulling my hair out (and I'm short enough of that already ... LOL). I can't get Ubuntu to let me run the custom qemu executable. Really is looking like apparmor. Fighting with that, but struggling to have it let me run it :-(.

Thanks.

My apologies, but I'm somewhat stuck here :-(. Trying to run the latest (upstream) version of QEMU, but no luck getting it to execute. I even tried setting securit_driver = "none", as captured here,
https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/Libvirt

But no luck. Open to any suggestions.

Thanks!

OK, found my issue! :-). Still a bit odd, but virt-manager complaints about the custom QEMU executable => but virsh still works. So I did get the VM running, with,
QEMU emulator version 5.1.93 (v5.2.0-rc3)
Copyright (c) 2003-2020 Fabrice Bellard and the QEMU Project developers

But it still performed the same. I also checked the xml file (VM definition), and made sure to change the machine to the most current version (pc-q35-5.2), but also no improvement.

Other things to try?

Thanks!
