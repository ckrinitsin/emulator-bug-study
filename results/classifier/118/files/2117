Unraid, Ubuntu, 9P/virtio and memory issues
Description of problem:
I am running an Ubuntu VM on Unraid - which is using Qemu. I am exposing my shares through "9p Mode" to the VM.

The logs shows:
-fsdev local,security_model=passthrough,id=fsdev-fs0,path=/mnt/user/backup \
-device '{"driver":"virtio-9p-pci","id":"fs0","fsdev":"fsdev-fs0","mount_tag":"backup","bus":"pci.1","addr":"0x0"}' \

Inside Ubuntu, I mount the exposed shares like this:

sudo mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio "backup" /media/share/backup

I have a script that uses rsync to sync the files from these mounted shares onto an internal disk drive. 

The issues that I am facing, is that rsync sometimes reports "cannot allocate memory":

rsync: [sender] readdir("/media/share/backup/myfolder"): Cannot allocate memory (12)
 
There are "ten thousands" of files in that folder hierarchy, but there are plenty of memory available on the VM (many GBs), so that is no issue. The next time I run the job, it might go through as normal. But I would like to get rid of these issues.

The question is: Is there some kind of memory allocation/limit to the virtio/9p as well? If yes - is there some way to increase it to avoid these errors?
Steps to reproduce:
1. Mount as shown
2. Run rsync on folder with lots of files
3. See error
