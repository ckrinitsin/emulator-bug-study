qemu and qemu.git -> Migration + disk stress introduces qcow2 corruptions

Hi guys, here I am, reporting yet another issue with qemu. This time, it's something that was first reported in January, and Juan proposed a patch for it:

http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/89009

[PATCH 4/5] Reopen files after migration

The symptom is, when running disk stress or any intense IO operation in guest while migrating it causes a qcow2 corruption. We've seen this consistently on the daily test jobs, both for qemu and qemu-kvm. The test that triggers it is autotest stress test running on a VM with ping-pong background migration.

The fix proposed by Juan is on our RHEL branch and such a problem does not happen on the RHEL branch. So, what about re-considering Juan's patch, or maybe work out a solution that is satisfactory for the upstream maintainers?

The URL that you've mentioned in the description is not valid anymore ... can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU, or can we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
