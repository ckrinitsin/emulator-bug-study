[ppa 2.0~git-20140225] mouse cursor invisible with Ubuntu live system

As requested on u-devel@, I tested QEMU 2.0~git-20140225.aa0d1f4-0ubuntu2 from ppa:ubuntu-virt/candidate. This has a regression with the mouse cursor.

I downloaded the current Ubuntu Desktop trusty beta-1 amd64 image, and booted it in QEMU:

  $ kvm -m 2048 -cdrom trusty-desktop-amd64.iso

This boots fine, but in the desktop I don't see any mouse cursor.

Interestingly this only happens with sdl.  Using vga it works fine.

It also works fine in qxl/spice (qemu ... -spice disable-ticketing,port=5930;  spicy -h localhost -p 5930).

i have the same, I don't see any mouse cursor. System is working.

Host: Ubuntu release 14.04 x86_64
Gast: Ubuntu release 14.04 x86_64

Graphic: GeForce GTX 650 Ti BOOST/PCIe/SSE2
Driver: nvidia 331.38



there are my terminal commands:

$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 BOOTSYSTEM.img 10G 
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -hda BOOTSYSTEM.img -cdrom /dev/cdrom -boot d -m 1024


I still regularly get this. The workaround is to open a terminal, which causes the cursor shape to change. Once that is done, the cursor stays visible.

Hi Martin,

when you get this, I assume that is with the standard trusty or utopic package?

I ask because the subject says 'ppa' - i'd like to remove that.

It's actually fine for me with current utopic's 2.1+dfsg-2ubuntu2. I tested both the default graphics card as well as "-vga vmware".
