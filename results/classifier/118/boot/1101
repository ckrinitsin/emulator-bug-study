QEMU 7.0.0 corrupts VHDX and VHD (VPC) files on write.
Description of problem:
QEMU writes to VHDX and VHD (VPC) files produce a corrupt/non-compliant image.
QEMU appears to be able to read VHDX and VHD images correctly.

This problem manifests in at least two cases
1. When attaching a VHDX/VHD file to a QEMU machine.  A previously working OS image created using the Hyper-V and imaging tools boots properly, but writes that normally occur in the running VM are not written out correctly.  The image will fail to boot the next time due to corruption.
2. Image conversion operations *TO* VHDX/VHD fail.  (note that QEMU correctly converts *FROM* VHDX/VHD assuming a well formed input image).  This implies that reads to VHDX/VHD are OK, but writes to VHDX/VHD are NOT OK.
Steps to reproduce:
1. See Above.
