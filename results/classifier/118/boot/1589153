qemu-system-x86_64 version 2.5.0 freezes during windows 7 installation in lubuntu 16.04

Hi!

I have been using qemu - kvm for several years in different versions of ubuntu (lubuntu). I am trying to migrate from 15.04 to 16.04 and am having a problem. In particular, on my machine (a samsung series 9 with dual core i7 processor and 8gb ram) the following commands worked in 15.04 but do not work in 15.10 and 16.04. FYI, I tested them on a clean machine, where I have created a 60GB image file in its own partition.. In particular, I am using the command to start installing windows 7 and it works in a clean install of 15.04 (yesterday) but not in 15.10 (yesterday) or 16.04 (the day before). I do not get any error messages in my xterminal when running this and do not know how to check for windows error messages. By not working I mean that after loading files it gets to a windows screen and then stays there forever.

The command lines used to invoke qemu is:
echo "*** Installing windows 7 virtual machine - Step 2"


echo "*** Try command for slow mouse"
export SDL_VIDEO_X11_DGAMOUSE=0

sudo qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -enable-kvm \
  -machine pc,accel=kvm \
  -cdrom  /home/Archives/Software/OperatingSystems.Windows7HP.64/Windows7HP64_Install.iso \

Have a similar issue though on Ubuntu 14.04 (4.2.0-36-generic #42~14.04.1-Ubuntu)

We use an automated appliance build process, to create qemu/KVM appliances.

Ever since qemu 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.24 security update, we are getting the same issue as mentioned above (Windows 7 Installation CD - X17-24281.iso, hangs after loading files).

We had to pin to 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.22 to resolve the issue.



Please see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2325843&p=13499322#post13499322 for a similar discussion and for a workaround.  But please note that to the best I can tell it is still a bug.
