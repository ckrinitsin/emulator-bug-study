Likewise no sound

Hi,
using fresh Ubuntu 11.10 with Likewise 6 in a MS Domain.
Domain users log with no sound.
Local users are OK.

Thx

Sry, posted in the wrong chanel.

Can I move it to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/likewise-open ?

I have same issue.
11.10 local user sound works.
Sound hardware is shown under Ubuntu sound.
Installed likewise from Ubuntu repository and logging in as domain user hardware doesn't show up in sound config. No sound.
It also doesnt access sound hardware in most apps, although it does in Skype.
I added Dom user to audio, admin etc, and reinstalled audio, but can't get this to work as Dom user.

I also have the same problem on Ubuntu 12.04.1 64 bits.

A fresh install only with likewise open from the repository. Local user have sound but domain user do not!

I have tested on 4 diferent machines with diferent hardware and the problem is always the same...

Status changed to 'Confirmed' because the bug affects multiple users.

Moving this to likewise-open according to comment #1.

This is a dupe of #925023 jadis confirmed on 2012-03-01 but never solved.
