Windows 11 Guests ExtendedDesktopSize Not Working
Description of problem:
Windows 11 VM with the latest virtio-win drivers installed (v0.1.240) does not respond to remote resize requests.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Windows 11 VM with virtio-win drivers installed and virtio video enabled.
2. Create a VNC session with resizeSession enabled.
3. Try resizing the window.
Additional information:
The resolution can be resized within the VM itself (i.e., from display settings), just doesn't automatically resize when the viewing window changes. Other VMs (including Windows 10) created and viewed within the same setup do change with the window resize.

The Chrome console log has a number of `Server did not accept resize request: Unknown reason` errors in it.
