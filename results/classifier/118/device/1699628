Direct Sound Audio does not stop

The Bug:
DirectSound Audio does not stop because dsound_ctl_out does not end up calling IDirectSoundBuffer_Stop. This is due to a bug in dsound_get_status_out where the status flags returned from IDirectSoundBuffer_GetStatus are compared with DSERR_BUFFERLOST (an error code) rather than DSBSTATUS_BUFFERLOST (a status flag). The status is actually (DSBSTATUS_LOOPING | DSBSTATUS_PLAYING) and one of those flags happens to be set in the DSERR_BUFFERLOST value. As a result, dsound_get_status_out returns -1 and dsound_ctl_out exits before calling IDirectSoundBuffer_Stop.

The Fix:
A simple replacement of DSERR_BUFFERLOST with DSBSTATUS_BUFFERLOST in dsound_get_status_out. 
Should be: "if (*statusp & DSBSTATUS_BUFFERLOST) {"

Version Information:
I was able to produce this bug in Qemu 2.9.0 and with the latest source pulled from git://git.qemu-project.org/qemu.git (commit 8dfaf23ae1). I was able to verify my suggested fix with the latest source.

Guest OS:
Discovered running Minoca OS v0.4 (www.github.com/minoca/os). Images at https://www.minocacorp.com/download/nightlies/latest-x86. The Qemu test images I tried (http://wiki.qemu.org/Testing/System_Images) didn't have an easy sound setup (was looking for 'aplay' or similar).

Qemu Command Line:
./qemu-system-x86_64.exe -m 512 -hda pc.img -smp 4 -usbdevice keyboard -device intel-hda -device hda-duplex
