CD-ROM devices always return a one session, one track TOC

CD-ROM devices always return a one session, one track TOC, no matter if it is using ioctl's with the host or DMG images (both able of having multi track, multi session discs).

(P.S.: This bug prevents BeOS boot)

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
