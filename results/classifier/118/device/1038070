> qemu-kvm-1.1.1-r1 - USB activkey doesn't work anymore

Linux Distro: Gentoo

Smartcard Activkey doesn't work anymore. I use it without problem till version
qemu-kvm-1.0.1.

Follow a log extraction:

If you need any other info please tell me. 

I've tried with git version with same problem.

I've tried 1.1.1 and current upstream with a Windows 7 guest and the
device seems to show up and function properly in both cases.

One way that I *can* reproduce the error is by running your command-line
with an NSS database at some place other than the default search path
(/etc/pki/nssdb in 1.1 and upstream). I don't think this has changed
since 1.0, but maybe something changed on the distro side?

Can you try reproducing by compiling from upstream source?

Have you ever tried to reproduce this with the upstream QEMU version?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
