qemu-img created VMDK files lead to "Unsupported or invalid disk type 7" on ESXi
Description of problem:
Trying to start the VM using vmdk converted with qemu-img fails with

Failed to start the virtual machine.
Module DevicePowerOn power on failed.
Unable to create virtual SCSI device for scsi0:1, '/vmfs/volumes/5cca0155-bdddf31d-2714-00215acbeb1e/AppD-VM01/AppDdisk1-VM01.vmdk'
Failed to open disk scsi0:1: Unsupported or invalid disk type 7. Ensure that the disk has been imported.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Convert booting OS (in both Qemu and VMWare with the help of drivers) to vmdk 
2. Push vmdk file to ESXi datastore 
3. Try to boot

Additional information:
ESXi seem to use a specific implementation of vmdk, with a *name*.vmdk file being the descriptor of the virtual disk and a *name*-flat.vmdk.
