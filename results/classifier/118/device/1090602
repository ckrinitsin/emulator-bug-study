RFE: Allow specifying usb-host device by serial number

Currently you can pass through a host USB device to the guest like

  -device usb-host,vendorid=0x1234,productid=0x5678

Which is all well and good, but has problems if you are trying to assign to identical USB devices to the same guest.

It would be useful if there was an additional option that allow matching against the device's serial number, which should allow differentiating between two devices with the same product+vendor.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
