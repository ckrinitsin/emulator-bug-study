scsi disk emulation doesn't enforce FUA (Force Unit Access) in write-back mode

Microsoft NTFS utilizes the FUA bit in SCSI WRITE CDBs to insure integrity when a device advertises that it has write caching enabled.  The FUA bit is meant to ensure a write is written to non-volatile storage before returning.  This seems to not be enforced by QEMU's SCSI emulation code.

Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU?

Closing since there hasn't been any response within the last 7 months

Fixed in 1.1 (commit 7e8c49c56154ab5c45d4f07edf0c22728735da35). :)
