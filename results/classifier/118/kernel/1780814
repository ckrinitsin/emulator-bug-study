Hi -- this is an internal compiler error reported by your compiler. It's not a QEMU bug. The message suggests that you report it as a GCC bug: "See <https://bugs.launchpad.net/gcc-linaro> for instructions".


Thanks peter maydell for your comments.



Hi Peter Maydell ,

is that GCC compiler error or cross-compiler error ?

It must be the cross compiler. (Why did you report this against QEMU anyway?)


I thought it was QEMU issue. Sorry for that.
