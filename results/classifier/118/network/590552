New default network card doesn't work with tap networking

Unfortunately, I can provide very little information.

Hope this will be useful anyway.

I've upgraded qemu using debian apt to lastest unstable (QEMU PC emulator version 0.12.4 (Debian 0.12.4+dfsg-2), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard): looks like at some point the default network card for -net nic option was switched to intel gigabit instead of the good old ne2k_pci.

I was using -net tap -net nic options and my network stopped working.
When not working,
- tcpdump on the host shows me taht all packets are sent and received fine from guest
- tcpdump on guest shows that packets from host are NOT received

obviously, both host tap interface and guest eth0 interfaces, routing tables, dns, firewall, etc... are well configured.

Having banged my head for a while, I finally stopped the host and started it again using -net nic,model=ne2k_pci option, then my network magically started working again.

Seems like you were using the QEMU from your Linux distribution (Debian). If you want to have support for that version, you should use the bug tracker from your distro instead. Otherwise, can you please try again with the latest version from http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Download to see whether the bug is already fixed there? Thanks!

Thank you for your interest but after more than 6 years I can't even remember what this bug was about.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
