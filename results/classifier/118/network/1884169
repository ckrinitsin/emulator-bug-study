There is no option group 'fsdev' for OSX

When I try to use -fsoption on OSX I receive this error:

-fsdev local,security_model=mapped,id=fsdev0,path=devel/dmos-example: There is no option group 'fsdev'

That's the behaviour on macOS that I would expect ATM. So it's not a bug.

Your macOS version was compiled without virtfs support, that's why qemu does not even offer you these options.

Even though 9P is a network protocol, you still need support by host OS and guest OS for some kind of communication channel between host and guest. Currently 9pfs in qemu supports either virtio (Linux KVM host <-> Linux guest) or Xen as communication channel. For macOS so far nobody bothered to implement a communication driver for qemu 9pfs yet.

But actually OS X (macOS) supports 9pfs and it does have its own AppleVirtIO9PVFS which makes things a bit strange, would not that be a good workaround, to use the AppleVirtIO9PVFS?

All my best,
