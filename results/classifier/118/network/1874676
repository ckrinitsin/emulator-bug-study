[Feature request] MDIO bus

Various network devices open-code a MDIO bus with a dedicated PHY.
Introduce a new MDIO subsystem to
- reuse various duplicated components
- be able to interchange PHYs
- have common tracing
- use libqos to test all the PHYs from different NICs

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


OK. Feel free to change the status to Won't Fix.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved
to QEMU's new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked
as 'expired' now. Please continue with the discussion here:
