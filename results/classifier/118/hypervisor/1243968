VMware ESXi on QEmu Kernel Panic

I attempted to install ESXi 5.5 (the free version) into a QEmu 1.6.1 VM. The guest OS does have the svm capabilities, but it appears VMware is trying to do some kind of hypercall that crashes the guest.

There is more information here: https://communities.vmware.com/message/2297382

It seems to me that this stubbed feature should just be disabled if it is unusable. Or at the very least I should be able to disable it at run-time with a command-line argument.

Is there some way to disable all the hypervisor features that makes it very obvious to a guest os that it is running inside a VM? It would be great if I could install a software and it would actually work (even if it's slow with those features disabled).

FYI, my guest OS capabilities are:

power management:

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
