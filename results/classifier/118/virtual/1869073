qemu-arm-static crashes "segmentation fault" when running "git clone -s"

I want to use qemu-arm-static to cross-compile software. The compiler itself is a native cross-compiler connected via "distcc".

The problem is that a script tries to do some stuff with "git" and with a "git clone -s" command the whole story reproducibly stops with a "segmentation fault".

I don't know how to properly debug the issue but it happens 100% of the time that I get the "crash" or git just hangs forever with 100% CPU usage.

What is the version of QEMU you are using?

Actually this one magically went good. I'm testing in Virtual Box as my ARM64 host. Maybe something went wrong there. After rebooting the whole machine today "git" works well.

Will reopen if it happens again...

"git crashes" was a known issue with some older versions of QEMU (we had race conditions and git happens to go multi-threaded for some operations including I think 'clone'), but they should all now be fixed. If it does happen again I would recommend trying the most recent QEMU release.


Let's assume that this is fixed. Please open a new bug if it happens again.
