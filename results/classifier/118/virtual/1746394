No provider of glEGLImageTargetTexture2DOES found with NVIDIA proprietary driver

https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy/issues/148

I'm hitting this issue on Fedora 30 after an in-place upgrade.  Using gnome-boxes, I click on a virtual machine to open the console viewer and it crashes after a hang.  Terminal output looks like this:

[chris@gereon ~]$ gnome-boxes 

(gnome-boxes:15640): Gtk-WARNING **: 17:21:17.105: GtkFlowBox with a model will ignore sort and filter functions

Web searches lead me to the closed libepoxy bug posted by the OP.  I'm happy to provide more details about my system.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
