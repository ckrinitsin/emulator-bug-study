Can't install on Windows 10

Latest release (20190712) 64-bit doesn't install:

The setup seems to work fine at first and actually extract all the files needed for qemu in the correct location, but after it has done that, it proceeds to delete every file and leaves no trace of qemu except the installation folder.
The setup then finishes and notifies the user that it has been installed succesfully.

I downloaded the previous release and it installs correctly.

I just ran the installer from: 
 
  https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/qemu-w64-setup-20190713.exe
  
on a Win10 VM and it successfully installed and I checked for the files in Program Files and they were all there. Can you re-test with the latest installer please?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
