Guest machine freezes when NFS mount goes offline

I have a virtual KVM machine that has 2 CDROM units with ISOs mounted from a NFS mount point. When NFS server goes offline the virtual machine blocks completely instead of throwing read errors for the CDROM device.

Host: Proxmox VE 1.8-11 (Debian GNU/Linux 5.0)
KVM commandline version: QEMU emulator version 0.14.1 (qemu-kvm-devel)
Guest: Windows 7 professional SP 1

Thanks for reporting this.  There are instances where QEMU performs
blocking operations in a thread that will prevent the guest from
running.  I suspect you are hitting this case and refactoring work
needs to be done to ensure that QEMU threads never block.

Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU (currently version 2.9.0)?
