hmp command `hostfwd_remove` does not work on running vm

On a running VM, I ran the following two hmp commands:

"hostfwd_add tcp::43210-:43210" --> WORKS
'hostfwd_remove tcp::43210-:43210" --> DOES NOT WORK. returns 'invalid format'

QEMU version 5.1

Looks like intended behavior:

(qemu) help hostfwd_add
hostfwd_add [netdev_id] [tcp|udp]:[hostaddr]:hostport-[guestaddr]:guestport -- redirect TCP or UDP connections from host to guest (requires -net user)
(qemu) help hostfwd_remove
hostfwd_remove [netdev_id] [tcp|udp]:[hostaddr]:hostport -- remove host-to-guest TCP or UDP redirection


Not sure I understand. The intended behavior is to remove the ports. It doesn't do that. And it returns 'invalid format'.

(qemu) hostfwd_add tcp::43210-:43210
(qemu) hostfwd_remove tcp::43210-:43210
invalid format

My bad. The correct command is this:
(qemu) hostfwd_remove tcp::43210
This bug can be closed.
