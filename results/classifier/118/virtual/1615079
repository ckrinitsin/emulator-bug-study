GTK+ UI virtual consoles scrolling broken

"In the virtual consoles, you can use Ctrl-Up, Ctrl-Down, Ctrl-PageUp and Ctrl-PageDown to move in the back log."

the scrolling bar does not appear either

these are broken on gtk2 and gtk3

VTE is required for this to work?

if yes, the configure script should have info about the dependency

Are you talking about serial console? Or graphical (VGA) console? Which QEMU target (x86? ... and which machine?)? How did you start QEMU? ... this bug report clearly lacks some more information...

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
