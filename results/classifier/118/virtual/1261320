Virtual Disk with over 16TB 

Hi,

is there a option to create a disk for a vm with a size over 16TB. 

the problem that after the diskfile reach 16TB, the disk get a state of read-only at this limit.
I know, that 16TB file size is max, is there a option to create the disk in mutliple files?
we want to use 22 TB. in the VM 

To attach a partition directly to the vm, is not what we want to do.

best regards

Chris

Basically no, not in a clean way for a production VM.  Can you attach
multiple disks to the guest and then use software RAID0 or LVM to get a
22 TB device inside the guest?

If not, here are some options:
1. Switch to a different file system (XFS is your best bet)
2. Use LVM (and get a slight performance boost for free!)
3. Tweak file system settings (e.g. bigger block size may allow larger
files)

Hi Stefan,

thank you for your response. 

We're decided to only use 16Tb as vhd for the system.


best regards
