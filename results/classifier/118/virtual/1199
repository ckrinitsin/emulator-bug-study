Prevent virtual machine memory leakage
Description of problem:
The data written in the virtual machine does not clear the memory after the virtual machine is shut down. When the virtual machine with large memory is started, it may access the data of the previous virtual machine
Steps to reproduce:
1. create a virtual machine with large size memory( 80% of the host's Physical memory)
2. Request all free memory and write the characteristic string in vm
3. restart the vm
4. Request all free memory and query the last character string written
