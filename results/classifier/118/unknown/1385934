USB with passthrougth guest cannot enumerate USB host

Following the guide at http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/USB_Host_Device_Assigned_to_Guest

You might try connecting the device to a ehci/xhci bus (instead of the default uhci bus... i.e. USB 1.1). See docs/usb2.txt in the qemu source for more info.

the problem is this commit:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=b791c3b38c7969cb9f4acda8229e19fd865a1c08

it's easy to reproduce -- plug in a USB flash drive and try to pass it through

on the host:
$ lsusb
Bus 003 Device 004: ID 1307:0163 Transcend Information, Inc. 256MB/512MB/1GB Flash Drive

so launch qemu with that:
  -usbdevice host:1307:0163

and then in the VM, if it fails, you get those errors in dmesg, and the device doesn't show up in `lsusb`.  if it passes, `lsusb` reports it fine.

What's your USB flash drive's version? USB1.1 or USB2.0 or 3.0?
Please post the value:

1.cat /sys/bus/usb/device/xx-xx/speed    [xx-xx: hostbus-hostport]
2.And your exact command line launched Qemu .

i've attached the `lsusb -v` output for the device.  it is USB 2.0.  the sysfs speed file shows 480.

the qemu cmdline:
qemu-system-x86_64 \
        -hda images/root \
        -hdb images/var \
        -hdc images/usr \
        -append "root=/dev/hda console=ttyS0 panic=3 init=/ginit" \
        -kernel images/bzImage \
        -nographic \
        -no-reboot \
        -m 512 \
        -enable-kvm \
        -usbdevice host:1307:0163

You should add an ehci controller or xhci for USB2.0 device.
Please use such below cmdline:
-device usb-ehci,id=ehci \
-device usb-host,bus=ehci.0,vendorid=1307,productid=0163

BTW, This is a really bug, and Gerd had posted a patch:
 [PATCH] usb-host: fix usb_host_speed_compat tyops
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2014-11/msg01441.html

After applying this patch, you will get a warning:
 "Warning: speed mismatch trying to attach..." if you use the cmdline as your showing.

Thanks,

Can you check if the same error messages appear in /var/log/syslog and /var/log/libvirt/qemu/<machine>.log as I described in bug #1392504? Because I think it is apparmor related.

looks like 79ae25af1569a50a0ec799901a1bb280c088f121 (which is in qemu-2.2.0) makes it work again for my test case.  not sure if the OP wants to verify as well or just close this out now.

With qemu 2.2.0 I see now the usb dongle but using it give me some problem seen on the host:
libusb: error [submit_control_transfer] submiturb failed error -1 errno=22
Disabling caps and seccomp change nothing.
I strace the process and I see:
26170 ioctl(20, USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB, 0x7f00c0539eb0) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
26170 write(2, "libusb: error [submit_control_transfer] submiturb failed error -1 errno=22\n", 75) = 75


Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
