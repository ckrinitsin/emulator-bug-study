kvm smb server hogs cpu guest freeze

Binary package hint: qemu-kvm

kvm hogs the CPU reproducibly. I installed an Ubuntu using KVM. I run the machine with -net nic,model=rtl8139,macaddr=f0:00:BA:12:34:56 -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2223-:22,smb=/tmp/share, sshed into the machine and typed "telnet 10.0.2.4 139" to try whether the SMB server works. KVM then hogs the CPU.

Thanks for your bug report and for your contribution to ubuntu. Does kvm hogs the CPU if you're not connecting to the smb server? How much memory is allocated to the guest?

No it does not hog the CPU if I'm not triggering it the way I described. I run the machine with 512 megs.

I was able to reproduce this in the way described, marking confirmed.

I'm totally not familiar with the smb option, having never used it.  I'm lowering the priority from Medium -> Low, since smb is not one of the most critical kvm features.

I'm also forwarding the bug upstream.  Anthony, this bug is totally reproducible on qemu-kvm 0.12.3, as described in the initial report.  Can you confirm it against upstream code?  Are the invocations/options correct?  Is this expected to work?

Triaging old bug tickets... Can you still reproduce this behavior with the latest version, or has the problem been fixed now?

There hasn't been a reply to my question in the last comment within months, so I assume nobody cares about this anymore. So I'm closing this ticket now...

Clearing old bugs: No more occurring in any of my recent KVMs, setting this old bug to incomplete.

[Expired for qemu-kvm (Ubuntu) because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
