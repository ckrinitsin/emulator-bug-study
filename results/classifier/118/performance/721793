QEMU freezes on startup (100% CPU utilization)

0.12.5 was the last version of QEMU that runs ok and boots any os image.

0.13.0-0.14.0 just freeze, and the only thing I see is a black screen and both of them make it use 100% of CPU also.
Both kernels 2.6.35.11 and 2.6.37.1 with and without PAE support.

tested commands:

W2000:
$ qemu -m 256 -localtime -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net tap -usbdevice host:0e21:0750 /var/opt/vm/w2000.img
W2000:
$ qemu /var/opt/vm/w2000.img
OpenBSD 4.8:
$ qemu -cdrom ~/cd48.iso -boot d empty-qcow2.img

tried to use `-M pc-0.12` selector, different audio cards (I've found it caused infinite loop on startup once) -- no luck.
tried to use recent seabios from git -- still no luck.

attached strace log of 0.14.0.

everything was tested on HP mini 311C with Intel Atom N270.





QEMU 0.15.0 fixes the problem.

Closing as "Fix released" according to comment #3
