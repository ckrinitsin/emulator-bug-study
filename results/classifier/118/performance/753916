performance bug with SeaBios 0.6.x

in my tests SeaBios 0.5.1 has the best performance (100% faster)
i run qemu port in windows xp (phenom II x4 945, 4 gigas ram DDR3) and windows xp (Pentium 4, 1 giga ram ddr)

Hi. Thanks for reporting this issue.

Can you tell us a bit more about the problem?
I'm not sure what the cause could be, but perhaps we can understand it better with some of the following information (plus anything else you can think of that could be related):
 - What version of QEMU are you running on each machine?
 - Did you build it yourself? If so, can you describe how? If not, can you provide a pointer to where you got it?
 - What are you running as the guest environment(s)?
 - I'm assuming that Windows XP is the host environment (two different host machines from your description). Which version / service packs do you have installed?
 - How did you do the tests? For example, what is the benchmarking tool or load that you are using? How are you using those tools / loads? Can you provide the numbers for each host?

i use QEMU for test PEs (preinstaled environments) in pendrives with a bat script

#
SET SDL_VIDEODRIVER=directx
qemu.exe -m 512 -localtime -M pc -hda \\.\physicaldrive1
#

my workstation run Windows XP SP3 with all hotfixes, and i use QEMU 0.14.0 (this port http://www.megaupload.com/?d=8LUG85F9)

i run syslinux loader for Linux PLD rescue .iso file

i record a test with camstudio http://www.megaupload.com/?d=37LDTOS3

OK, from your test.swf file, I assume that the way you're testing is the boot-up of a Linux ISO, and that "100%" is an estimate of boot speed.

I'm really not sure what the problem is. I can only suggest that you try various SeaBIOS versions and try to isolate which version is the problem. It also might be worth seeing if the problem affects other Linux distro boot-up.

SeaBios 0.x is pretty outdated nowadays, so I think we should close this bug ... anyway, if you still have problems with SeaBios, you likely should it report on the SeaBios mailing list (https://www.seabios.org/Mailinglist) instead of using the QEMU bugtracker.
