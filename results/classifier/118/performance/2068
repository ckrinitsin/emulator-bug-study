Regression: 8.1.3 -> 8.2.0 breaks virtio vga driver
Description of problem:
I have a number of emulated arch linuxes using the same x11/kde configuration. After updating from 8.1.3 to 8.2.0, they all broke in the following way:
- screen tearing/artifacts seen from bios up until sddm
- sddm is possibly affected
- kde/x11 has so many artifacts that its unusable. if i attempt to write in a console window, i can only see parts of what ive written if i attempt to gently resize the bottom of the window. clicking the menu item will only render the menu 1/6 times and only partly. however if I click where I remember the shutdown button to be, the system shuts down immediately, so thi seems to be purely a graphics issue.
- starting with -vga qxl fixes all issues.
Steps to reproduce:
1. make new qemu, install arch/kde
2. boot said qemu with -vga virtio option
3. observe issue from the moment it boots
Additional information:
Using nVidia card and drivers on host.

Removing x86-video-vesa on the guest system seemed to significant improve performance. There are still many artifacts but its almost usable with this driver removed.
