Laggy and/or displaced mouse input on CloudReady (Chrome OS) VM

This weekend I tried to get a CloudReady (Chrome OS) VM running on qemu 5.2. This seems to wok quite well, performance seems to be great in fact. Only problem is mouse input.

Using SDL display, there is no visible mouse unless I set "show-cursor=on". After that the mouse pointer flickers a bit and most of the time is displaced so I need to press below a button in order to hit it. After switching to fullscreen and back using ctrl-alt-f this effect seems to be fixed for a while but the mouse pointer does not reach all parts of the emulated screen anymore.

Using SPICE instead the mouse pointer is drawn, but it is *very* laggy. In fact it is only drawn every few seconds so it is unusable but placement seems to be correct. Text input is instant, so general emulation speed is not an issue here.

To reproduce, download the free image from https://www.neverware.com/freedownload#home-edition-install

Then run one of the following commands:

qemu-system-x86_64 -drive driver=raw,file=cloudready-free-89.3.3-64bit.bin -machine pc,accel=kvm -m 2048 -device virtio-vga,virgl=on -display sdl,gl=on,show-cursor=on -usb -device usb-mouse -device intel-hda -device hda-duplex

qemu-system-x86_64 -drive driver=raw,file=cloudready-free-89.3.3-64bit.bin -machine pc,accel=kvm -m 2048 -device virtio-vga,virgl=on -display spice-app,gl=on -usb -device usb-mouse -device intel-hda -device hda-duplex

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
