CDOS ps/2 mouse problem

Qemu v2.10.2 (also tested with 2.11.0)
Host OS : CentOS 7 x86_64 (1708)
Guest OS : Concurrent DOS 386 3.0 (with GEM)

There is my launch command : 
/usr/local/bin/qemu-system-i386 -m 4m -cpu 486 -hda /home/my_user/HDD.img -vga std

When I'm launching the guest, it is not responding after focusing in the viewer. I think this is due to the ps/2 emulation because when I add "-usb -device usb-mouse" in my command I don't have this issue (but in this case, mouse is not supported by CDOS).

I tested with an older version of Qemu (0.11) which uses the Bochs bios (instead of SeaBios in newer versions), and I don't have this issue either.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
