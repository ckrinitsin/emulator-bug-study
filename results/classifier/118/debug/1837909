This seems to be related to use of AI_ADDRCONFIG in qemu-sockets.c inet_parse_connect_saddr, dropping it fixes the test. 'man getaddrinfo' makes it sound like AI_ADDRCONFIG requires the host to have a non-loopback ipv4 or ipv6 address available

This host setup may seem niche, but it is what the 'mock' RPM build tool has by default. In Fedora we run the test suite during the RPM build, so the failing test causes a bit of pain for certain workflows

This should be addressed by: https://<email address hidden>/

GETADDRINFO(3)

  If hints.ai_flags includes the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag, then IPv4
  addresses are returned in the list pointed to by res only if
  the local system has at least one IPv4 address configured, and
  IPv6 addresses are returned only if the local system has at
  least one IPv6 address configured.  The loopback address is not
  considered for this case as valid as a configured address.
  This flag is useful on, for example, IPv4-only systems, to
  ensure  that  getaddrinfo() does not return IPv6 socket addresses
  that would always fail in connect(2) or bind(2).

I'm a little confused, and I don't feel fluent enough with English to be
sure that "only if A and only if B" is equivalent to "requires (A or
B)". Maybe the man page should use 'or' instead of 'and' here...

Would this diff snippet help?

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
