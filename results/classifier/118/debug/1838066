unexpected error: raw_reconfigure_getfd(): qemu-system-x86_64: Could not reopen file

  Unexpected error in raw_reconfigure_getfd() at block/file-posix.c:923:
  qemu-system-x86_64: Could not reopen file: Permission denied
  Aborted

Is what i sometimes (only) get, mostly for Linux guests i'd say (Arch just a few moments ago).
This is on CRUX-Linux, thus a self-compiled qemu 4.0.0 with default recipe, without special compiler flags (-O2 -march=x86-64 -pipe) on an Intel i5 laptop.
But what i do is running this via sudo:

     sudo='sudo --preserve-env=VMNAME,VMADDR' runas='-runas vm -chroot .'
  fi

  VMADDR=$addr VMNAME=$vmname
  export VMADDR VMNAME
  eval exec $sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -name $vmname $runas \
      $host $accel $display $net $vmcustom $vmimg $redir

the last run ends up like (via sudo)

  qemu-system-x86_64 -name arch-2019 -runas vm -chroot . -cpu host -m size=1984 -smp cpus=2 -enable-kvm -accel accel=kvm,thread=multi -display curses -net nic,netdev=net0,macaddr=..  -netdev tap,id=net0,script=./.ifup.sh,downscript=./.ifdown.sh,ifname=vm_arch-2019

vm is a user effectively living in the chroot only without any rights anywhere.
Hope this helps, thanks a lot for qemu!!

Hi,

Can you retry with any 4.1 release candidate (like 4.1.0-rc2)?  (Or wait for the 4.1.0 release in hopefully about a week?)  The error message sounds like it should be fixed by https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2019-05/msg00775.html .

Though I have no idea why you would hit that if you didn’t add any block devices.

Ok?  Great news, i will wait until then, it does not really hurt
me (i do not even see it when now setting up a new VM with debug
and thus -display enabled).

Thanks!!

Was missing a line in the ps output, i see.
Yeah, sorry. ^_^
A nice weekend if at all possible i wish!
