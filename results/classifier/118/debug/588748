QEMU fails to boot DR DOS Plus since 0.6.1

The commit in r1049 (serial interrupt fix (Hampa Hug)) prevents booting Digital Research DOS Plus.



This patch doesn't seem correct as the spec is pretty clear that THRE interrupt enable is set to high, then an interrupt is rased if LSR.THRE=1.  Does the following also make DOSPlus boot again:

No it doesn't. Same as unpatched.

Can you add some debugging to see what IER is being set to?

Do you have any insight into why DR DOS Plus is failing?

With DEBUG_SERIAL defined, serial logs:
serial: event 2
serial: write addr=0x01 val=0x02
serial: read addr=0x01 val=0x02
serial: read addr=0x02 val=0x02
serial: write addr=0x01 val=0x00

serial: write addr=0x01 val=0x0f

(stalls here)

I think the interrupt should be raised only on the rising edge of THRE.

Has this bug been fixed by this commit here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=1645b8eee558ffe2389
?
If so, I think we could now close this bug ticket...
