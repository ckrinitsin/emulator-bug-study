TCG: QEMU incorrectly raises exception on SSE4.2 CRC32 instruction

If I run FreeBSD on QEMU 5.2 with TCG acceleration -cpu Nehalem, I get a FPU exception when executing crc32 (https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=253617). This is not a problem with the default CPU (or KVM) since that does not support SSE 4.2.

Attaching GDB shows this is triggered in target/i386/tcg/translate.c:3067

    /* simple MMX/SSE operation */
    if (s->flags & HF_TS_MASK) {
        gen_exception(s, EXCP07_PREX, pc_start - s->cs_base);
        return;
    }

However, according to https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/m/8/b/8/D9156103.pdf, page 61 the CRC32 instruction works no matter what the value of the TS bit.

The code sequence in question is:
0xffffffff8105a4de <+126>:	f2 48 0f 38 f1 de	crc32q %rsi,%rbx
0xffffffff8105a4e4 <+132>:	f2 48 0f 38 f1 ca	crc32q %rdx,%rcx.

This should work even with the FPU disabled.

Could someone familiar with the target/i386 decode logic could have a look at this? It should be a rather simple change to avoid the exception for the crc32 encoding. However, I am not familiar with x86 instruction encodings so it would take me a long time to come up with a correct patch.
Thanks!

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
