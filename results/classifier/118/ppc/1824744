ivshmem PCI device exposes wrong endianness on ppc64le

On a ppc64le host with a ppc64le guest running on QEMU 3.1.0 when an ivshmem device is used, the ivshmem device appears to expose the wrong endianness for the values in BAR 0.

For example, when the guest is assigned an ivshmem device ID of 1, the IVPosition register (u32, offset 8 in BAR 0) returns 0x1000000 instead of 0x1. I tested on an x86_64 machine and the IVPosition reads 0x1 as expected.

It seems possible that there's a ppc64*==bigendian assumption somewhere that is erroneously affecting ppc64le.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
