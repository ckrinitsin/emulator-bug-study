Please send the patch to <email address hidden> instead of uploading it
to launchpad, it'll get more developer attention.

The standard patch email format is an inline patch (not an attachment)
as sent by git-send-email(1).  That makes it easiest to review and
quickest to merge.

Looks like this had been fixed here:
