Cannot install on ArcoLinux
Description of problem:
I tried to install with my package manager 
```
paru -S qemu-git
```
and got these errors
```
qemu-git: /usr/share/qemu/bios-microvm.bin exists in filesystem (owned by seabios)
qemu-git: /usr/share/qemu/vgabios-ati.bin exists in filesystem (owned by seabios)
```

I tried searching around for a solution but I can't seem to find anything relevant to my situation.
