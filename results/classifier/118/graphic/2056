macOS Cocoa title bar covers top of VM screen
Description of problem:
When using the Cocoa interface the title bar covers the top part of the VM screen. In Windows XP, using show-cursor=on and USB tablet (-usb -device usb-tablet,bus=usb-bus.0), the mouse cursor seems to be off by the height of the title bar; to click on a target the mouse cursor has to be below the target by about the height of the top bar.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run Qemu using the Cocoa-interface (-display cocoa)
Additional information:
The problem exists in both Qemu 8.2.0 (compiled from source) as well as in the MacPorts version (version 8.0.5). Further testing shows the same problem in versions 6.2.0, 7.0.0, and 7.1.0. This problem did not exist in previous versions of macOS.

A screenshot is enclosed:
