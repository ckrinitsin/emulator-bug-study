Solaris 2.6.5 panic when trying to debug a binary with Sun Workshop V5n1, or V6n1 debugger
Description of problem:
Following [this guide](https://www.gekk.info/articles/solaris26.htm), and similarly to issue #1166, the guest panics when one tries to debug a binary with the debugger provided in [Sun Workshop V5n1](https://archive.org/details/sunworkshopforsolaris2vol5num1_704546810revb), and in [Sun Workshop v6n1](https://archive.org/details/devpro_v6n1) as well.
The Sun Workshop is EOL, available at the archive, with free non-expiring demo licenses [made available](https://archive.org/details/suncomp-lic) by Sun before the Oracle acquisition.
The guest was patched with the latest available patches included [in this cluster](https://archive.org/details/sun26gnu).
The following information was collected when debugging bunzip2, but any binary panics the guest.
```
panic: Non-parity synchronous error: ctx=54 va=ef7cbc44 pa=e0a8c44
syncing filesystems... 15 done
NOTICE: zs3:ring buffer overflow
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start the Sun Workshop (SUNWspro/bin/workshop), go to the Debugger in the menu
2. Debug/New Program, load any binary, place a breakpoint in main or wherever
3. Execute, guest kernel panic
Additional information:
This happens with the Fujitsu MB86904 specified as CPU, and without specifying a cpu, using the default for the SS-5.

Explicitly setting the TI MicroSparc I and setting memory to 32M seems to start the debugger, the guest still panics, but a bit further down the line
