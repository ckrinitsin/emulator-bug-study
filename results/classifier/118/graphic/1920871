netperf UDP_STREAM high packet loss on QEMU tap network

Hi, I boot a guest with "-netdev tap,id=hn0,vhost=off,br=br0,helper=/usr/local/libexec/qemu-bridge-helper" network option, and using "netperf -H IP -t UDP_STREAM" to test guest UDP performance, I got the following output:

Socket  Message  Elapsed      Messages                
Size    Size     Time         Okay Errors   Throughput
bytes   bytes    secs            #      #   10^6bits/sec

212992   65507   10.00      144710      0    7583.56
212992           10.00          32              1.68

We can find most of UDP packets are lost. But I test another host machine or use "-netdev usr,xxxxx". I can got:
Socket  Message  Elapsed      Messages                
Size    Size     Time         Okay Errors   Throughput

212992           10.00       18350            961.56

most of UDP packets are recived.

And If we check the tap qemu used, we can see:
ifconfig tap0
tap0: flags=4419<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet6 fe80::ecc6:21ff:fe6f:b174  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>

        TX errors 0  dropped 16349024 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
lots of TX packets are dropped.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
