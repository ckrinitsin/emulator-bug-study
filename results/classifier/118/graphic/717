using the "scsi-cd" option on arm64 platform
Description of problem:
When using OpenStack to create a virtual machine instance, I need to configure the password of the root user through cloud-init. I use the ConfigDriver method, in which OpenStack will mount a virtual disk in iso9660 format to the virtual machine instance. The command line generated by OpenStack is shown above. You can see that this ConfigDrive virtual disk is mounted via "--device scsi-cd". But when I entered the virtual machine instance and used lsblk, blkid and searched in /dev/disk/by-label, I did not find the virtual disk that should be mounted. In addition, I don't have more debugging messages or error messages. I want to know if the "scsi-cd" is not fully adapted to arm64 platform.
