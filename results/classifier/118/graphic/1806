Tests: YAMON binaries unavailable
Description of problem:
The [tests for MIPS](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blame/master/tests/avocado/machine_mips_malta.py#L127) download the YAMON firmware binaries, however that link does not exist anymore. It appears that it may have [moved to ](https://www.mips.com/develop/tools/boot-loaders/)mips.com (or maybe that's where it came from?), which states "To support existing users of these, and the QEMU project, YAMON is now available under the GPL License." However those links are also dead. I've not been able to find the referenced binaries or source anywhere. @philmd, do you happen to have a copy you can upload? Alternatively, I've found the 2.16 source [here](https://github.com/binsgit/mips-yamon).

Another alternative would be to use U-boot, which is easy to get a hold of and would work for this test (just getting to a prompt, although I've had issues with it being able to access an IDE drive). I haven't found prebuilt binaries for MIPS and u-boot though.
