No interrupts are delivered to the guest after rebooting Windows 98
Description of problem:
After Windows 98 is rebooted in QEMU, the guest freezes: the system is unresponsive to key presses and the boot splash animation halts.  The guest performs fine before the reboot.

Closer examination reveals that no hardware interrupts are delivered to the guest.  BIOS Data Area variables like the keyboard buffer and the system clock are not updated.  Even non-maskable interrupts fail to be delivered, as witnessed by installing an option ROM that hooks interrupt vector 2 and issuing the `nmi` command in the monitor.

The only remedy seems to be to exit the QEMU process entirely and launch it again.
Steps to reproduce:
0. Install Windows 98 into the guest.  (Since the normal installation process already involves a couple of reboots, it is possible to hit the issue already at step zero.)
1. Boot it; it may be into Safe Mode, but the protected-mode graphical environment must at least attempt to load.  (I managed sometimes to reproduce the bug without the system having loaded fully.)
2. Reboot. This may be a clean reboot, or it may be a hard reboot (`system_reset` or equivalent)
3. Observe the system freeze.
Additional information:
None
