Qemu-system-avr working example
Description of problem:
I'm trying to get an Arduino board emulated with QEMU. Unfortunately, I can't get it to work.
I tried the commands, given in [https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/target-avr.html](https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/target-avr.html) and also downloaded and used the example elf file.


I then tried some more basic commands and used`qemu-system-avr -machine uno`. This should
run without any problems or? I also tried `2009` and `mega2560`.

I also searched on the internet about working examples as well as further usage information, but I couldn't really find much.
Therefore, I hope someone can help me out or point me to additional material.
Steps to reproduce:
1. run `qemu-system-avr -machine uno`
2. wait around 5-10 seconds
3. on the terminal the following message appears with the qemu window crashing
```
$ qemu-system-avr -machine uno
  qemu-system-avr: execution left flash memory
```
Additional information:
I'm fairly new to this, so please excuse me if I forgot something to post or made a mistake while posting.
