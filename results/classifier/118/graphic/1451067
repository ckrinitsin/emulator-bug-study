-smb option requires full path for Samba sharing to work

This issue has been reported on qemu-devel a looong time ago: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2005-12/msg00141.html

QEMU version 2.2.1-4 on Arch Linux x86_64

Steps to reproduce:

host$ mkdir share
host$ chmod o+rwx share
host$ qemu <other options> -smb share

vm$ smbclient //10.0.2.4/qemu -N
smbclient: Can't load /etc/samba/smb.conf - run testparm to debug it
Domain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Windows 6.1] Server=[Samba 4.2.1]
tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME
vm$ poweroff

Workaround:

host$ qemu <other options> -smb /full/path/to/share

vm$ $ smbclient //10.0.2.4/qemu -N
smbclient: Can't load /etc/samba/smb.conf - run testparm to debug it
Domain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Windows 6.1] Server=[Samba 4.2.1]
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Sat May  2 19:57:31 2015
  ..                                  D        0  Sat May  2 19:57:31 2015

		961302540 blocks of size 1024. 637557248 blocks available
smb: \> quit

Please, please fix this gotcha, whether in the documentation or in code. it can cause some serious bouts of hair-pulling.

On my system, `qemu` is an alias for `qemu-system-x86_64`.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
