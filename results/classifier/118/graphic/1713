hw/input/hid.c - Add Support for More Than Five Mouse Buttons in QEMU for evdev?
Additional information:
Sure enough, there appear to only be five buttons defined.

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/hw/input/hid.c#L113

```c
[INPUT_BUTTON_LEFT]   = 0x01,
[INPUT_BUTTON_RIGHT]  = 0x02,
[INPUT_BUTTON_MIDDLE] = 0x04,
[INPUT_BUTTON_SIDE] = 0x08,
[INPUT_BUTTON_EXTRA] = 0x10,
```


At this point, the existing naming schema cannot be continued... might I suggest:

```c
[INPUT_BUTTON_SIX] = 0x??,
[INPUT_BUTTON_SEVEN] = 0x??,
[INPUT_BUTTON_EIGHT] = 0x??,
[INPUT_BUTTON_NINE] = 0x??,
[INPUT_BUTTON_TEN] = 0x??,
[INPUT_BUTTON_ELEVEN] = 0x??,
[INPUT_BUTTON_TWELVE] = 0x??,
```
Although, I'm not sure if 12 buttons is future-proofed enough.

I should also note that I found this post which states that there's no more space left in PS2 emulation, so I don't know if that would cause a conflict.
"ps/2 emulation looks like there are no unused bits for more buttons.  Possibly we have to extend the usb mouse emulation for that."

Unfortunately, I have never written a patch. I'm not even sure how I would apply a patch in Unraid, other than overwriting the bin file. So if this is ever fixed, I would simply hope that one day a new version of QEMU would get up-streamed into a new version of Unraid.

So, here I am humbly asking for support. I don't know if it's as simple as just adding new definitions... and I have no idea what hex value to assign them.

*edit* I also failed to get a temporary workaround to work by remapping the mouse buttons in the host VM using xmodmap using this command:

`xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 2" &`
I tried saving `pointer = 1 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 2` in the host VM's root folder in .Xmodmap, but it did not propogate to guest VMs. The buttons were still their original mapping and running the xmod command had no effect.
