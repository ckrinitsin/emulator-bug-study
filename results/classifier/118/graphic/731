Display resolution fixed by 800x600 with latest VirtIO drivers and guest additions
Description of problem:
Display resolution can't be changed to anything else than 800x600.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install qemu/kvm
2. Create virtual machine
3. Setup Windows 10
4. Install VirtIO-Drivers
5. Install guest-agent
6. Install qxl-drivers

Steps 5 and 6 enable use of QXL-Display, but do not lead to allow for higher display resolutions than before.

Screen resolution is fixed by 800x600.
Driver is installed, but seems to have a problem (Attention sign. Warning, Error: digital signatur could not be checked -- at least there is no how to to make the existing signature work).
Latest available VirtIO-drivers where used as available from https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso 

Older available drivers did not work too as expected. Same problem. Could not check older Windows 10 versions, because of lack of older install media.
