bundle QEMU installer with a QEMU GUI (graphical user interface) such as Virt Manager

For a better out of the box user experience on the Windows platform it would be nice if a QEMU GUI would be by installed by the same QEMU installer. Currently it is required to first install QEMU and then install a QEMU GUI.

I don't know all QEMU GUIs but looks like Virt Manager is a decent QEMU GUI and still maintained.

Virt Manager is also available for Windows.

However as per these instructions it is difficult (many steps) for laymen to install Virt Manager on Windows (cygwin...).

Sorry, but I don't think that any of the current QEMU project members has plans to work on such a bundle. This requires a new contributor to step up and do the job.
