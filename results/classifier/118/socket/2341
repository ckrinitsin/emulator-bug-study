IVSHMEM device doesn't work for sharing memory with virtiofsd
Description of problem:
Trying to share a folder on the host to the guest with `virtiofsd` using the `ivshmem-plain` device doesn't work (for memory sharing), while using a NUMA node (with `-numa node,memdev=mem`) works just fine.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install `virtiofsd`
2. Run `/usr/libexec/virtiofsd --socket-path=/tmp/vhostqemu --shared-dir=$HOME --cache always` as a regular user (or with another shared directory, it doesn't matter)
3. Run QEMU with the aforementioned command line as a regular user
4. Wait a bit for the OS to load and `virtiofsd` should error out
Additional information:
`virtiofsd` logs:
```
