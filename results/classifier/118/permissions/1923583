colo: pvm flush failed after svm killed

Hi,
   Primary vm flush failed after killing svm, which leads primary vm guest filesystem unavailable.

qemu versoin: 5.2.0
host/guest os: CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)

Reproduce steps:
1. create colo vm following https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/docs/COLO-FT.txt
2. kill secondary vm (don't remove nbd child from quorum on primary vm)and wait for a minute. the interval depends on guest os.
result: primary vm file system shutdown because of flush cache error.

After serveral tests, I found that qemu-5.0.0 worked well, and it's the commit https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=883833e29cb800b4d92b5d4736252f4004885191(block: Flush all children in generic code) leads this change, and both virtio-blk and ide turned out to be bad.

I think it's nbd(replication) flush failed leads bdrv_co_flush(quorum_bs) failed, here is the call stack.
#0  bdrv_co_flush (bs=0x56242b3cc0b0=nbd_bs) at ../block/io.c:2856

While i am not sure whether i use colo inproperly? Can we assume that nbd child of quorum immediately removed right after svm crashed? Or it's really a bug? Does the following patch fix? Help is needed! Thanks a lotÔºÅ

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.
