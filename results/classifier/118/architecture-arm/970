ARM SCTLR allows writes to "write ignore" bits
Description of problem:
The firmware I have executed in qemu sets up pagetables and then enables the MMU.
A few instructions later, a prefetch abort was occurring. After debugging it turned out the problem was because get_phys_addr_v5 was being used to walk the pagetable instead of get_phys_addr_v6.
qemu has this code:
```c
regime_sctlr(env, mmu_idx) & SCTLR_XP
// where SCTLR_XP is commented as
#define SCTLR_XP      (1U << 23) /* up to v6; v7 onward RAO */
```
Somewhat interestingly, A5 has a lot of bits marked as `/WI`: https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0433/c/system-control/register-descriptions/system-control-register

A9 has less, but still a few which qemu is not handling: https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0388/e/the-system-control-coprocessors/summary-of-system-control-coprocessor-registers/system-control-register
I've made this hacky patch to fix it for myself:

```
I think the real fix would allow expressing the ones/zeros mask as part of `ARMCPU` per-arch.
