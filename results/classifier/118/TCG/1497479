memory corruption with migrate/savevm in TCG mode

[ISSUE]

QEMU releases 2.3.1 and lower are forgetting to flush TLBs before enabling the global dirty pages log and entering the final stage of saving the VM.

[DESCRIPTION]

The situation is the following:
1. TLB misses is the only way for page dirtying in the TCG mode.
2. If TLB is hit by a running VM during the execution of the `ram_save_iterate' by migration thread (e.g. if VM is mostly idling) then some pages are missing in the dirty log.
3. These pages are then not migrated during `ram_save_complete'.
4. This makes memory content in a saved VM state differ from the actual VM memory.
5. If the affected area includes some Kernel data structures such as trees or lists this can cause Kernel to Oops after loading the saved state.

[SOLUTION]

A proposed solution is to flush TLB when `log_global_start' is called.
Here is the patch: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+bug/1493049/+attachment/4459905/+files/tcg-commit-on-log-global-start.patch

Hi,

is this a duplicate of 1493049?  (Should they be merged?)

Hi,

This one is for QEMU master, 1493049 is for Ubuntu packages.

Generally combining them is still better - but if it helps you to
keep things straight then no problem, sorry for the noise - thanks.


Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays? If you still can reproduce the issue, please send your patch to the qemu-devel mailing list for discussion (we generally do not take patches from the bugtracker). See https://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch for details.
