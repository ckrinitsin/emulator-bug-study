Freezing VNC screen on some the UEFI framebuffer applications

Hi folks!

I use TianCore (UEFI) formware on the qemu (master version last commit a6e0344).
When kernel/linux is start, it using UEFI Framebuffer. Then I run UEFI application (which writes directly to the framebuffer) my VNS screen is freezing. Then I restart vnclient I see only one frame.

When I run application, I getting in the file hw/display/vga.c on function 'vga_ioport_write' some commands, it change "s->ar_index" from 0x20 -> 0x10 

In the function vga_update_display:
1751         if (!(s->ar_index & 0x20)) {
1752             graphic_mode = GMODE_BLANK;
1753         } else {

And I got GMODE_BLANK mode. If I patch it:
1751         if (0) {

my VNC not freezing.

From "Hardware Level VGA and SVGA Video Programming Information Page" I saw, what ar_index is 0x3C0 (Attribute Controller Data Write Register), 0x20(5-bit) is PAS -- Palette Address Source

If there is a output via the UEFI framebuffer, does the difference have a PAS or not? Why do we need to pause the output if the PAS is exposed? Especially when the application outputs via framebuffer.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
