qemu-aarch64-static segfaults running ldconfig.real (amd64 host)

This affects the qemu-user-static 1:8.2.2+ds-0ubuntu1 package on Ubuntu 24.04, running on a amd64 host.

When running docker containers with Ubuntu 22.04 in them, emulating arm64 with qemu-aarch64-static, invocations of ldconfig (actually ldconfig.real) segfault. For example:

$ docker run -ti --platform linux/arm64/v8 ubuntu:22.04 
root@8861ff640a1c:/# /sbin/ldconfig.real
Segmentation fault

If you copy the ldconfig.real binary to the host, and run it directly via qemu-aarch64-static:

$ gdb --args qemu-aarch64-static ./ldconfig.real

It looks like this is a known qemu regression after v8.1.1:
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1913

Downgrading the package to qemu-user-static_8.0.4+dfsg-1ubuntu3_amd64.deb fixes the segfault.

I can confirm that reverting https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/aec338d63bc28f1f13d5e64c561d7f1dd0e4b07e, as described in https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1913, solves the issue.


Thank you for taking the time to report a bug.

It seems that the discussion about whether that specific commit should be reverted is still ongoing.  As such, I don't feel confident in backporting any fixes that have not been accepted by upstream, and I would like to wait for their solution to the problem.

I will mark the bug as Triaged, but let's wait until there's a decision upstream on what to do with the issue.

Thanks.

For the moment, the problem can be worked around by installing older packages, but it is not really a supported configuration: the older package was built for Ubuntu 22.04.

I agree that upstream should make a decision first, but it seems that they are not yet convinced whether reverting will cause other issues.

Indeed it looks like /sbin/ldconfig is a bit of a special case, and the versions shipped in some Ubuntu releases work, while others segfault (the permission error is fine, as my non-privileged user cannot write /etc):

ldconfig.real.focal     ldconfig.real.focal: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission denied
ldconfig.real.groovy    ldconfig.real.groovy: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission denied
ldconfig.real.hirsute   Segmentation fault (core dumped)
ldconfig.real.impish    Segmentation fault (core dumped)
ldconfig.real.jammy     Segmentation fault (core dumped)
ldconfig.real.kinetic   ldconfig.real.kinetic: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission denied
ldconfig.real.lunar     ldconfig.real.lunar: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission denied
ldconfig.real.mantic    ldconfig.real.mantic: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission denied
ldconfig.real.noble     ldconfig.real.noble: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission denied
ldconfig.real.oracular  ldconfig.real.oracular: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission denied

So the 'window' of bad ldconfig versions is from hirsute (21.04) through jammy (22.04). After that, the problem seems to disappear.


I'm using quemu to tweak Armbian Jammy images for Raspberry Pi 5 (so it would have ldconfig from 22.04) and I have signal 11 when libc reconfiguration is triggered by apt.

What you may find interesting running the same process of updates on the same base image on Ubuntu 22.04 (which has qemu 6.2) works fine.

My googling around "libc signal 11 quemu" lead to a lot of people reporting problems with docker buildx with qemu predating 7.0. This smells kind of regression in 8.2 used in 24.04. Then the issue linked above says affected ldconfigs are 2.33 to 2.35...

Does Ubuntu really need to wait for upstream to deal with this? It's a huge slap in the face for everyone on 24.04 needing to meddle 22.04 ARM64 images.

FWIW, I left a comment on the bug report asking for guidance, because it seems to me that just reverting the commit mentioned above isn't the right solution (as we'd be reintroducing the bug fixed by the commit).

Hi, this issue also happens when I try to run debootstrap for Jammy arm64 on a Noble amd64 host. At the moment I use the workaround to use ubuntu:jammy workers instead of ubunut:latest. It would be great if this issue can be fixed soon.

Hi,
this came up in our dormant bugs checker ...
There was no reply from upstream yet, but I agree that a blunt revert might be wrong unless they agree.
Sergio reached out, but probably needs to kindly ask again with some extra noise.

Upstream has committed https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/4b7b20a3 which fixes the segfaults. A prerequisite for the qemu 8.2.2 package in Ubuntu 24.04 is https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/c81d1faf, so here is a patch that includes both.


Thank you!
Adding to plucky soon and then planning SRUs as the queue gets freed of the former one in flight.

The attachment "Fix qemu-aarch64-static segfaults" seems to be a patch.  If it isn't, please remove the "patch" flag from the attachment, remove the "patch" tag, and if you are a member of the ~ubuntu-reviewers, unsubscribe the team.

That's 1.9.x line - is it going to be backported to Noble? That's LTS we plan to use for next couple of years and this qemu problem is hitting us hard.

If you look at the top of this bug, you can see the two merge requests put in by Lukas, one for noble and one for oracular:
* https://code.launchpad.net/~slyon/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+git/qemu/+merge/481940
* https://code.launchpad.net/~slyon/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+git/qemu/+merge/481943

My guess is that the noble-devel and oracular-devel branches are the places where the proposed update packages are built from, which will eventually end up in the regular updates. But no idea how long that usually takes.


Given this possible regression:

   * This changes the alignment of sections in the ELF binary via QEMUs elfloader, if something goes wrong 
     with this change, it could lead to all kind of crashes (segfault) of any emulated binaries.

Is there something we could do to mitigate it? Perhaps a quick similar ldconfig test in other emulated scenarios?

With 8.2.2+ds-0ubuntu1.6, running a Docker container with Ubuntu 22.04, targeting arm64 on an amd64 host, and upgrading the libc package results in:

The verification of the Stable Release Update for qemu has completed successfully and the package is now being released to -updates.  Subsequently, the Ubuntu Stable Release Updates Team is being unsubscribed and will not receive messages about this bug report.  In the event that you encounter a regression using the package from -updates please report a new bug using ubuntu-bug and tag the bug report regression-update so we can easily find any regressions.

Great, I hope the fix lands in noble too, soon.
