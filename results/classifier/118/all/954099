This bug is related to ARM based processor emulation and has been fixed in Linaro QEMU(qemu-linaro). You can install qemu-linaro to solve the problem. This can be confirmed with the following link(Point 6) : http://www.cnx-software.com/2012/03/08/instructions-to-run-raspberry-pi-fedora-14-remix-in-qemu/

It's probably also fixed in upstream qemu master since I haven't deliberately put anything in to qemu-linaro to fix it -- we've almost certainly just picked up the fix from upstream.

Incidentally "-M versatilepb -cpu arm1136-r2" is veering slightly into "unsupported" territory, since there's no such thing as a VersatilePB board with an 1136 CPU in the real world. And did you really want arm1136-r2? That's an r0p2, whereas "arm1136" is the newer r1pX which is probably what the RPi is actually using. (Yes, qemu's names for these two CPU types are hopelessly confusing. Sorry.)





Hi Peter,
many thanks for the update, I'll give it another shot with later binaries and a more accurate CPU :-)

Thanks again,

Joe

Since there hasn't been any more complains about later binaries, I assume we can close this issue nowadays. (Feel free to re-open it otherwise)
