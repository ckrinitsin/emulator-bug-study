qtest failures leave orphaned qemu processes hanging around

If a qtest test case fails, it leaves orphaned qemu processes hanging around. On Fedora 18 with qemu.git as of today ( Feb 26 2013), the  patch just forces a test failure

ps axwww | grep qemu | grep -v grep
$ make check-qtest-x86_64

The problem is that an assertion failure in a test case causes the test program to exit(2) without hitting the qtest cleanup.

I think this has been fixed sometime in the past already. Or can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU?

It appears this is fixed, I haven't seen it in a while
