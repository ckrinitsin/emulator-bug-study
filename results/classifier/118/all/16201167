[BUG] Qemu abort with error "kvm_mem_ioeventfd_add: error adding ioeventfd: File exists (17)"

Hi list,

When I did some tests in my virtual domain with live-attached virtio deivces, I 
got a coredump file of Qemu.

The error print from qemu is "kvm_mem_ioeventfd_add: error adding ioeventfd: 
File exists (17)".
And the call trace in the coredump file displays as below:

By printing more info in the coredump file, I found that the addr of 
fds_old[146] and fds_new[146] are same, but fds_old[146] belonged to a 
live-attached virtio-scsi device while fds_new[146] was owned by another 
live-attached virtio-net.
The reason why addr conflicted was then been found from vm's console log. Just 
before qemu aborted, the guest kernel crashed and kdump.service booted the 
dump-capture kernel where re-alloced address for the devices.
Because those virtio devices were live-attached after vm creating, different 
addr may been assigned to them in the dump-capture kernel:

the initial kernel booting log:
[    1.663297] pci 0000:00:02.1: BAR 14: assigned [mem 0x11900000-0x11afffff]
[    1.664560] pci 0000:00:02.1: BAR 15: assigned [mem 
0x8001800000-0x80019fffff 64bit pref]

the dump-capture kernel booting log:
[    1.845211] pci 0000:00:02.0: BAR 14: assigned [mem 0x11900000-0x11bfffff]
[    1.846542] pci 0000:00:02.0: BAR 15: assigned [mem 
0x8001800000-0x8001afffff 64bit pref]


I think directly aborting the qemu process may not be the best choice in this 
case cuz it will interrupt the work of kdump.service so that failed to generate 
memory dump of the crashed guest kernel.
Perhaps, IMO, the error could be simply ignored in this case and just let kdump 
to reboot the system after memory-dump finishing, but I failed to find a 
suitable judgment in the codes.

Any solution for this problem? Hope I can get some helps here.
