qemu spinning on serial port writes

As originally found at http://<email address hidden>/msg08745.html from 3 years ago! 

Basically qemu seizes up in the event that the file descriptor for its emulated serial port has a full buffer, i.e. write() returns EAGAIN.  For me, this happened when the serial port was being directed through a UNIX socket, with a default-sized 4KB buffer.  Just the normal output from a Linux kernel boot caused it to seize up, and stop the main emulation / select loop.

My suggestion is to remove the detection of EAGAIN in qemu-char.c:521, so that if the buffer is full, KVM discards the byte(s) it was trying to write.  This is a surely better outcome than the process spinning forever.

I will submit a separate patch to control the buffer sizes when creating UNIX sockets, which will help allow slow-reading processes to tune things so that they don't miss any output.

Additionally, in the context of a hosted environment, if the -serial option is used, this could be a small security issue. An untrusted user of a guest system, knowing their serial output is going via a small buffer, could spew output to their /dev/ttyS0 at a rate fast enough to trigger this bug and eat a CPU core on the host.

To quote David S. Ahern's original bug report (mine was the same, only with the latest version from git, so line numbers may have changed - my suggested fix above is accurate though):

I am trying to redirect a guest's boot output through the host's serial
port.  Shortly after launching qemu, the main thread is spinning on:

write(9, "0", 1)   = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)

fd 9 is the serial port, ttyS0.


The backtrace for the thread is:

send_all() invokes unix_write() which by design is not breaking out on
EAGAIN.

The following command is enough to show the problem:

qemu-system-x86_64 -m 256 -smp 1 -no-kvm \
    -drivefile=/dev/cciss/c0d0,if=scsi,cache=off,boot=on \
    -vnc :1 -serial /dev/ttyS0


The guest is running RHEL3 with the parameter 'console=ttyS0' added to
grub.conf; the problem appears to be with qemu, so I would expect it to
show with any linux guest. This particular host is running RHEL5.2 with
kvm-81, but I have also seen the problem with Fedora-9 as the host OS.

Yes, the serial port of the server is connected to another system via a
null modem. If I change the serial argument to '-serial udp::4555' and
use  'nc -u -l  localhost 4555  > /dev/ttyS0' I see the guest's boot
output show up on the second system as expected. I'd prefer to be able
to use the serial port connection directly without nc as a proxy.
Suggestions?

I have a similar problem, and the problem goes away if I remove the "-serial pty" device from my command line:

/home/mrhines/qemu/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 /kvm_repo/cb/vmbase -serial pty

Such a simple command line, but QEMU seizes up and slows to a crawl and the host CPU is spinning at 100%

Which version of QEMU have you been using here? Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU (currently version 2.9)?

I'm confident this has been solved a while ago. When this bug was reported, the code was indeed broken wrt EAGAIN handling. 

The chardev code has long since been re-written though, and the send_all method replaced by io_channel_send_all() which will handle EAGAIN by returning instead of spinning in a loop.

Specifically this commit changed the code to stop spinning in send_all() on EAGAIN

    qemu-char: add watch support
    
    This allows a front-end to request for a callback when the backend
    is writable again.
