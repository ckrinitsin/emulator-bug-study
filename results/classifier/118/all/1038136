lack of keycode 89 for br-abnt2 keyboards

qemu-kvm-1.1.1
host system: slackware64-13.37
Bug detailed description:
Independent of Guest OS nothing happens when keycode 89 is pressed. 
If you select option "-k pt-br" at qemu commandline you get keycode 89 but there is no more keycode 26 (dead_acute dead_grave) and keycode 51 fails on "less" sign.
If you have a numeric keyboard you can use its "slash" key but there is no means to use the question mark, causing discomfort when you are scripting or programming.

I have the exact same problem.


Bug is confirmed and at least one and a half year old, according to this blog post, with a hack for solving it:
http://blog.nielshorn.net/2011/03/qemu-and-brazilian-keyboards/

I've managed to resolve it applying the following patch (without "-k pt-br"):

--- qemu-1.6.0+dfsg.orig/ui/x_keymap.c
+++ qemu-1.6.0+dfsg/ui/x_keymap.c
@@ -94,7 +94,7 @@ static const uint8_t x_keycode_to_pc_key
  */

 static const uint8_t evdev_keycode_to_pc_keycode[61] = {
-    0,         /*  97 EVDEV - RO   ("Internet" Keyboards) */
+    0x73,      /*  97 EVDEV - /?°  (ABNT2 Keyboards) */
     0,         /*  98 EVDEV - KATA (Katakana) */
     0,         /*  99 EVDEV - HIRA (Hiragana) */
     0x79,      /* 100 EVDEV - HENK (Henkan) */


Attached patch (may not apply cleanly as I edited it manually to correct for space alignment; but c'mon, it is so straight forward).

Thanks
I will test it

Looks like this the key has been added by this commit here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=33aa30cafcce053b83
So I think we can close this bug ticket now.
