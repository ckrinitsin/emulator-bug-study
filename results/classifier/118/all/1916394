[git] Cannot build qemu: FAILED: target/hexagon/semantics_generated.pyinc 

Hello.

I tried to build Qemu at commit 4115aec9af2a3de5fa89a0b1daa12debcd7741ff but it stops with this error message:

[code]
Found ninja-1.10.2 at /usr/bin/ninja
[632/9068] Generating semantics_generated.pyinc with a custom command
FAILED: target/hexagon/semantics_generated.pyinc

[/code]

ninja version: 1.10.2
meson version: 0.57.1

Last commit which build is going to its end: https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=08895cda3a57fe2d72ef621800606ddc2f5eb612

Will try to see later with hexagon patches to see which one is breaking the build process.

Here are the configure options I'm using:

--prefix=/usr
--sysconfdir=/etc 
--localstatedir=/var 
--libexecdir=/usr/lib/qemu 
--extra-ldflags="$LDFLAGS" 
--smbd=/usr/bin/smbd 
--enable-modules 
--enable-sdl 
--disable-werror 
--enable-vhost-user 
--enable-slirp=system 
--enable-xfsctl
--audio-drv-list="pa alsa sdl"

LDFLAGS: -Wl,-O1,--sort-common,--as-needed,-z,relro,-z,now


Here is what I found to narrow the commit which breaks the build process.

Last working commit: 2184bca7b17559107032ba4fd8fc6f65345276ed -> "qapi: Replace List[str] with Sequence[str] for ifcond"

First broken commit: 3e7a84eeccc3b3a9b43c6dfb52bd98ea5acebf0a -> "Hexagon build infrastructure"

I can't seem to reproduce this locally, I will try to see if I can get my configuration to match yours more closely.

Does the attached patch mitigate the build issue?  0001-target-hexagon-fix-meson-build-failure.patch

Sorry for the late reply. Tried patch... Here is the output:

Still busted. Nothing changed.

Still having trouble reproducing the issue.

I don't have an arch system so I used Docker.  Would you be willing to check whether the Dockerfile represents a close enough match to your build process?

Also, if you can think of anything particularly unique about your configuration, maybe I can try to come closer to reproducing this with some of those critical factors.

docker_arch_qemu_build.log.xz shows the output from the docker build via arch linux

I looked at it, and there seems to be no difference. Looks like my installation is rotten.

Let's close this bug as invalid.

I tried something else, and build process went right: building qemu in a clean-chroot: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DeveloperWiki:Building_in_a_clean_chroot

 Well, something is broken on my real installation, or it could be a bug in a package as I'm using testing. Anyway, this bug can be closed as I can build Qemu successfully now.

Looks like there's a patch proposed that sounds as if it would mitigate this symptom:
