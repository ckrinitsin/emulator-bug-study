qemu-system-x86_64 - two mouse pointers & fast scrolling problem

Hello,

System Specs

Host:
--------
Slackware 14.1 x86_64
Openbox 3.5.2
tint2 panel (svn version)
Nvidia GTX660M
nvidia-driver-346.35
Screen: 17" @1920x1080@60Hz


Guest
---------
Slackware 14.1 x86_64
XFce 4.10
Screen 17" @1920x1080
xf86-video-vmware 13.0.1

QEMU 2.2.1

I start Slackware in QEMU using 'Zoom To Fit' when it first boots up and I log into X, at this point I notice the mouse shows with 2 pointers and when I move the mouse around, shows as trails, but it's actually a second pointer that appears under the first.

If I use 'Ctrl Alt F' and go into full screen mode the mouse gets corrected and only appears as one pointer and no pointer under the second one when moving around. So this mouse problem only appears the first time I log into X with 'Zoom To Fit'. 

Also if log in instead as 'Full Screen' I do not see the issue, as well as if I log in 'Full Screen' and change back to 'Zoom To Fit' it does not happen.

I also noticed that if I scroll with the mouse wheel very fast while, as an example, in any application and wanting to move quickly around, the mouse ends up moving me instead to another virtual desktop, XFce by default uses 4. If I just scroll slowly nothing happens, it's only when moving the mouse wheel quickly that the focus gets taken off the application for some reason and put on the desktop and moves you.

Command line options:
--------------------------------
qemu-system-x86_64 -rtc base=localtime Slackware\ 14.1\ x64.img -m 4096 --enable-kvm -smp 2 -vga vmware -usbdevice tablet

I wanted to use -usbdevice tablet to have seamless mouse movement back and forth from Host to Guest without having to Grab...

If I remove '-usbdevice tablet' and log into X the frst time as 'Zoom To Fit' I see two mouse pointers, but as soon as I click the desktop and the mouse is grabbed the second one goes away and when I move the mouse there is only one pointer.

Also without the optiion '-usbdevice tablet' and I move the scroll wheel quickly the mouse stays focused on the application and it doesn't move the desktop.

Please see the attached screen shots, qemu_1.jpg shows 2 mouse pointers when I first log into X and qemu_2.jpg shows when I'm staying in 'Zoom To Fit' mode and moving the mouse around, with a pointer under the pointer.





As a Linux geek, developers need to take the time to respond to bug reports. People like myself help you to improve your app.

This is one of the very few reports I've made in many years of Linux where a developer(s) doesn't take the time to reply to a bug report to let the end-user know what is going on.

Now in 2.5.0 I still see the same problem, so has anyone even looked at this?

I hope someone this time will reply, I do not like taking my time to make reports with projects that show no interests back to the community, trying to help.

SORRY I'm not trying to have an attitude this just doesn't feel good when someone doesn't take the time to reply back...

When using -usbdevice tablet, this is the problem with having two mouse pointers, and the scrolling problem, scrolling a site in Firefox changes the desktop to another virtual desktop.

AGAIN SORRY, I wasn't trying to have an attitude, just frustrated that in all this time, no one answered this report...

thank you

Hi! I'm currently looking through old bug reports. Big sorry, seems like this
completely fell through the cracks... sometimes developers are just too busy
with other stuff or nobody really has a clue how to tackle certain bug tickets...
but it would have been good to have at least some reply here - I know this is
quite frustrating for a bug reporter otherwise.

Anyway, the QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking
to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you want to get this bug report transferred to the new system, then please
switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if the
problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
