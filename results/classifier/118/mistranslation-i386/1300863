Qemu does not show all files on floppy or hard drive (MS DOS 6.22 guest)

My host system is a raspberry pi model B 512MB. To start qemu I typed into lxterminal:
  
qemu-system-i386 -hda qemu.img -Fda Dos622-1.img -boot a

Qemu version 1.7.0+dfsg-3 installed as package. The DOS disks were downloaded from winworldpc.com and if I mount them under Linux I see all the files, but on qemu I see the first 3 files only. The hard drive image I am using is a 30MB flat image created using bximage.

Seems like you are using the QEMU from your Linux distribution. If you want to have support for that version, you should use the bug tracker from your distro instead. Otherwise, can you please try again with the latest version from http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Download to see whether the bug is already fixed there? Thanks!
