Open Solaris 2009 Doesn't Boot

The latest git version of qemu (commit 420b6c317de87890e06225de6e2f8af7bf714df0) fails to boot the OpenSolaris image from http://dlc.sun.com/osol/opensolaris/2009/06/osol-0906-ai-sparc.iso.

qemu-img create opensolaris 3G
qemu-system-sparc -hda opensolaris -cdrom osol-0906-ai-sparc.iso -boot d -redir tcp:2232::22 -k en-us -m 192

gives:

...
Trying cdrom:d
File not found
Trying cdrom...
Not a bootable ELF image
Not a bootable a.out image
No valid state has been set by load or init_program

Host: Linux/x86_64
gcc4.5
./configure --enable-linux-aio --enable-io-thread --enable-kvm

Are you sure that it boots on real hardware? From the information given in
http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/osol/opensolaris/2009/06/README.osol-repo
I'd expect that this image is not bootable from CD-ROM.

A Debian CD-ROM boots without any problem.

The URLs don't work any more, and according to Stefan's comment, this was likely not a bug, so I'm closing this ticket now (feel free to open it again if you don't agree).
