OpenGL support is disabled

$ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -display sdl,gl=on -vga qxl
SDL1 display code has no opengl support.
Please recompile qemu with SDL2, using
./configure --enable-sdl --with-sdlabi=2.0
qemu-system-x86_64: OpenGL support is disabled


Can you please recompile qemu with support for opengl. The -display mode allows for opengl support.

This feature allows for the guest OS to have opengl 2 support, that is require for several 3d applications.
It also opens the way for supporting acceleration on windows and Linux guest systems.

Since you're talking about a pre-compiled binary, I assume you wanted to open this bug against Ubuntu's QEMU package, not against the QEMU project?

Looks like that this bug is duplicate of https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+bug/1540692

Isn't it?

Status changed to 'Confirmed' because the bug affects multiple users.

Opengl in general as requested  was enabled and backported up to Bionic (18.04).

There are several usability enhancements to use that with either mdev passthrough and virtgl which I work on upstream and are going into Disco (19.04).
