Can't load Android VBOX image or even linux test image as well

Can't load Android X86 ICS 4.0 VBOX image.
It worked with previous version before adding /qemu/hw/pc_sysfw.c file ( tested with version 1.0 ). 

x86_64-softmmu# ./qemu-system-x86_64 ~/kvm-test-image/x86-linux-0.2.img
qemu: PC system firmware (pflash) must be a multiple of 0x1000

In QEMU website (http://wiki.qemu.org/Testing), there is a test image for linux
but, new version can't load the image as well because of upper error.
linux-0.2.img.bz2 (8 MB) 	Small Linux disk image containing a 2.6.20 Linux kernel, X11 and various utilities to test QEMU

I'm getting this same error with qemu v1.1.1 on a RAW formatted disk image of windows XP that used to work.

> qemu -m 1024 -hda xp.img -localtime -net user
qemu: PC system firmware (pflash) must be a multiple of 0x1000

I've no idea what this error could mean =)

Triaging old bug tickets ... Can you still reproduce this problem with
the latest version of QEMU?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
