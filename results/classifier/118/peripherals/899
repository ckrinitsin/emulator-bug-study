HVF: Ubuntu Server fails to boot Linux 5.4.0-104
Description of problem:
On macOS with HVF, when Ubuntu Server updates the Linux kernel to 5.4.0-104, it no longer boots and gets stuck at `EFI stub: Exiting boot services and installing virtual address map...`. This is not the case with QEMU 6.0.0 (with @agraf's HVF patches applied).

It seems like 5.4.0-104 is the culprit because 5.4.0-100 boots fine.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download Ubuntu Server 20.04 ARM64 ISO: https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm
2. Run the above QEMU command (make sure networking is disabled so Ubuntu installer does not auto-upgrade the kernel)
3. Install Ubuntu with the default settings and reboot
4. It will not reboot (expected) so Ctrl+C and restart the command adding `-device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0` to the end to get networking
5. Boot into Ubuntu and install 5.4.0-104 kernel: `sudo apt install linux-image-5.4.0-104-generic`
6. Reboot and it will get stuck at `EFI stub: Exiting boot services and installing virtual address map...`
