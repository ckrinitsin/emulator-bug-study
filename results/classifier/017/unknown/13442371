[Qemu-devel] [BUG] nanoMIPS support problem related to extract2 support for i386 TCG target

Hello, Richard, Peter, and others.

As a part of activities before 4.1 release, I tested nanoMIPS support
in QEMU (which was officially fully integrated in 4.0, is currently
limited to system mode only, and was tested in a similar fashion right
prior to 4.0).

This support appears to be broken now. Following command line works in
4.0, but results in kernel panic for the current tip of the tree:

~/Build/qemu-test-revert-c6fb8c0cf704/mipsel-softmmu/qemu-system-mipsel
-cpu I7200 -kernel generic_nano32r6el_page4k -M malta -serial stdio -m
1G -hda nanomips32r6_le_sf_2017.05-03-59-gf5595d6.ext4 -append
"mem=256m@0x0 rw console=ttyS0 vga=cirrus vesa=0x111 root=/dev/sda"

(kernel and rootfs image files used in this commend line can be
downloaded from the locations mentioned in our user guide)

The quick bisect points to the commit:

commit c6fb8c0cf704c4a1a48c3e99e995ad4c58150dab

It looks the problem is in this code segment in of tcg_gen_deposit_i32():

        if (ofs == 0) {
            tcg_gen_extract2_i32(ret, arg1, arg2, len);
            tcg_gen_rotli_i32(ret, ret, len);
            goto done;
        }

)

If that code segment is deleted altogether (which effectively forces
usage of "fallback" part of tcg_gen_deposit_i32()), the problem also
vanishes (without changes from my previous mail).
