[Qemu-devel] [BUG] checkpatch.pl hangs on target/mips/msa_helper.c

If  checkpatch.pl is applied (using switch "-f") on file 
target/mips/msa_helper.c, it will hang.

There is a workaround for this particular file:

These lines in msa_helper.c:

        uint## BITS ##_t S = _S, T = _T;                            \
        uint## BITS ##_t as, at, xs, xt, xd;                        \

should be replaced with:

        uint## BITS ## _t S = _S, T = _T;                           \
        uint## BITS ## _t as, at, xs, xt, xd;                       \

(a space is added after the second "##" in each line)

The workaround is found by partial deleting and undeleting of the code in 
msa_helper.c in binary search fashion.

This workaround will soon be submitted by me as a patch within a series on misc 
MIPS issues.

I took a look at checkpatch.pl code, and it looks it is fairly complicated to 
fix the issue, since it happens in the code segment involving intricate logic 
conditions.

Regards,
Aleksandar

Thanks for figuring this out, Aleksandar.  Not sure if anyone else has
the apetite to fix checkpatch.pl.
