qemu-x86_64 crashes with "Illegal Instruction" on SPECCPU2017 Benchmarks
Description of problem:
I am running qemu-x86_64 with SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks, and the compiled benchmarks such as Perlbench will crash unexpectedly. I have changed to three other machines to run it and still get crashes on two of them, I don't know what's the problem and want some help.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile SPEC CPU 2017 basic Perlbench binary. 
2. Use the above command line to run it.
Additional information:
I have added some debugging flags to qemu-x86_64 to test it. The "-d in_asm" flag gives me the instructions before the crash like this:
```
