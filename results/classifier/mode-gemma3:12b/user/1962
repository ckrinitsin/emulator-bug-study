systemd-tmpfiles-setup-dev-early.service fails in emulated systemd-nspawn container
Description of problem:
When booting a fresh `debootstrap`ed Debian Trixie/testing rootfs with foreign architecture via `systemd-nspawn` and `qemu-user-static`, invoked via `systemd-binfmt`, the `systemd-tmpfiles-setup-dev-early.service` service within the guest fails, which leads to `/dev` not existing (respectively no default content), so that several other guest system components fail as well, like any console/shell access:
```

```
Steps to reproduce:
1. `apt install debootstrap systemd-container qemu-user-static`
2. `systemctl restart systemd-binfmt`
3. `mkdir rootfs`
4. `debootstrap --variant=minbase --include=systemd-sysv --arch=arm64 trixie ./rootfs 'https://deb.debian.org/debian'`
5. `systemd-nspawn -bD rootfs`
Additional information:
On Bookworm guest systems and/or without QEMU emulation, this works without issues, so I guess systemd recently started to use a certain syscall for the `ImportCredential=tmpfiles.*` method in systemd units, which is not supported by QEMU, probably similar to https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/28954?

I hope it is fine to report it here. Always difficult to decide whether to report to the distribution (Debian) or one, and in case which, of the related projects, which do not work together.

Debian Trixie currently ships `systemd 254.4-1` btw. I am not sure whether the issue was introduced with 253 or 254, since the linked issue prevented booting such containers on an earlier stage with 253, which was fixed in 254, which has the here reported issue.
