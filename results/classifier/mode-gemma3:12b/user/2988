Description of problem:
Absolute mouse mode is broken in SDL2. Bisected at 30aa105640b0a2a541744b6584d57c9a4b86debd.

Relative mouse mode has never worked in stretched SDL2 Display for display controllers that passed through cursor data and have positions warped by HOST UI backend. It looks like 30aa105640b0a2a541744b6584d57c9a4b86debd tried to fix this but it didn't work out. Scaling **"relative motions"** isn't straight-forward as what the commit had expected.

Absolute mouse mode mode has always worked in stretched SDL2 Display. 30aa105640b0a2a541744b6584d57c9a4b86debd broke it without fixing anything.
