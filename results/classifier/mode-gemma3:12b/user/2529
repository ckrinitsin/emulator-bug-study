`stack smashing detected` running arm64 image from amd64 machine
Description of problem:
When running a linux/arm64 `ubuntu:20.04` docker image on a linux/amd64 machine, an single command `apt-get update` will through below error
```sh
root@189bd36b9ae7:/# apt-get update
0% [Working]*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated
Reading package lists... Done
E: Method http has died unexpectedly!
E: Sub-process http received signal 6.

```

Tested this is happening for ubuntu:18.04, ubuntu:20.04, ubuntu:22.04 so far

If running same image directly from an ARM64 host, issue is gone
Steps to reproduce:
1. install QEMU on an AMD64 host machine (Ubuntu20)
   ```sh
   docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
   ```
2. run linux/arm64 docker image of ubuntu:20.04
   ```sh
   docker run --platform linux/arm64 -it --entrypoint /bin/bash ubuntu:20.04
   ``` 
3. from within the container, run `apt-get update`, it will through below error
   ```sh
   root@189bd36b9ae7:/# apt-get update
   0% [Working]*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated
   Reading package lists... Done
   E: Method http has died unexpectedly!
   E: Sub-process http received signal 6.
