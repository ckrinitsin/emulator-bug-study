Implement TPM2 configuration for emulators that provide TCP interface

swtpm provides several interfaces for its emulated device: unix socket (can be used by qemu), chardev. swtpm also provides TCP interface for the device which is very convenient for testing as it does not require root permissions.

It would be very useful to have QEMU to work with TPM devices emulated via TCP.
