Cocoa display hangs on macOS 10.15 (Catalina)

I have downloaded the latest stable source tarball 4.1.0 and compiled it (i386-softmmu target).

After opening a black window, QEMU hangs (spinning beach ball).
When building with `--disable-cocoa --enable-sdl`, display seems to work fine.

The same happened when I tried to build QEMU through HomeBrew and MacPorts.
