Hang in fsqrt

At least qemu-i368 and qemu-x86_64 hang in floatx80_sqrt in versions 2.6.0 and git (2.6.50) for some input values, likely due to an infinite loop at fpu/softfloat.c:6569.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Compile attached code: gcc -o test test.c -lm
2) `qemu-i368 test` and `qemu-x86_64 test` will hang at 100% cpu
