Build failure on macOS when using --disable-cocoa
Description of problem:
Build fails:

```
../qemu-8.2.1/meson.build:3741:13: ERROR: No host machine compiler for 'audio/coreaudio.m'
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. On macOS run `./configure --disable-cocoa`

Result:

```
Compiler for language objc skipped: feature cocoa disabled
```
```
../meson.build:3741:13: ERROR: No host machine compiler for 'audio/coreaudio.m'
```
Additional information:
It seems your build script contains the assumption that an Objective-C compiler is not needed when the Cocoa UI is disabled, but it still appears to be needed to compile the CoreAudio code regardless of UI.
