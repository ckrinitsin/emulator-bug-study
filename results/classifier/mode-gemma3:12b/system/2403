WHPX accelerator fails to boot guest Windows 7
Description of problem:
I get Qemu freezed on Starting Windows screen when trying to boot Windows 7 Professional
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run qemu with the above command line and until Starting Windows screen appears.
2. See qemu freezed.
Additional information:
tcg accelerator works ok, though (Windows 7 successfully boots as expected on native hardware):

- `qemu-system-x86_64.exe -accel tcg -cpu Westmere,aes=on,avx=on,sse4.1=on,sse4.2=on,ssse3=on,x2apic=on,xsave=on -m 4G -machine q35 -device qxl-vga,vgamem_mb=64 -hda Windows7_Disk.qcow2 -boot d -cdrom Windows7.iso`

  This bug seems to have the same roots: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1859
