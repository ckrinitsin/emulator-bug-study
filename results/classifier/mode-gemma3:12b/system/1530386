command.com on win95 throws video mode out

on a presumed-good copy of Windows 95 obtained from http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1960870, the operating system boots successfully and shows up fine, but as soon as I double-click the MS-DOS icon, the window, while remaining the same size, goes to a different resolution and only shows a small portion of what it did, with strange colors and artifacts. tried first with the Debian 2.5 package, then with latest cvs sources, then with the 2.5.0 release, all the same problem.
