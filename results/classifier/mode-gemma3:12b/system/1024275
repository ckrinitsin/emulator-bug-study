bad iteraction between -daemonize and -nographic

 $ qemu -daemonize -nographic
 $ _

After this, the terminal is switched to some weird mode, not processing cr/lf, and not showing the characters being typed (it is fixable by using `stty sane').

Something is seriously wrong here: When -daemonize is given, qemu not touch tty parameters at all.

Thanks,
