Make Uninstall Rule Requested

Environment: Ubuntu 14.04 - Qemu 2.1.1
------------------
I've configured qemu with some --prefix, compiled the sources and installed the binaries; now, for some reason, I need to uninstall qemu to configure it with the default prefix, recompile the sources and reinstall the binaries.
However, there's no rule to uninstall qemu.

All other packages which I have compiled and installed on my system offer the possibility to uninstall it: why not Qemu?
