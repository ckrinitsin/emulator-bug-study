qemu s390x on focal - applications breaking

Running qemu-system-s390x (1:4.0+dfsg-0ubuntu10) on an x86-64 Focal host with an upgrade of a Eoan s390x VM to a Focal s390x is triggering random breakage, for example:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

And now bash is completely broken:

Floating point exception (core dumped)

The upgrade works OK on a s390x, so I'm assuming it's something to do with the qemu emulation.
