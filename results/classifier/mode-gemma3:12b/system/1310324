Commit 0f842f8a introduces regression when using tcg-interpreter

Hi.

Commit 0f842f8a246f2b5b51a11c13f933bf7a90ae8e96 apparently introduces a regression when using --enable-tcg-interpreter. The regression is manifested as follows:

 1. Checkout any qemu commit later or equal that the one said above. Beside that one, I tested v1.7.1, v2.0.0 and a few other commits suggested to my by git bisect.
 2. Possibly cherry-pick commit a32b12741bf45bf3f46bffe5a79cb2548a060cd8, which fixes a compilation bug with --enable-tcg-interpreter.
 3. Compile with: ./configure --target-list=i386-softmmu --enable-tcg-interpreter && make -j8
 4. Create an empty virtual disk and try to install Windows XP on it booting from Windows CD-ROM. After the loading program, the installer immediately crashes with blue screen (it should instead show the installation confirmation dialog and then the EULA acceptance dialog, if it worked correctly).

I'm mentioning Windows XP because it is the problem I found. Probably other operating systems would fail as well. I can test others, if you think it would be helpful. I can also give you access to the very exact CD-ROM image I'm using.

The exact command line I'm using is:
build_location/i386-softmmu/qemu-system-i386 -m 512 -drive file=winxp_test.img -cdrom wipxp_cdrom.iso

Attached is the blue screen that I see (unfortunately it is Italian, but that's a standard error message and I hope this is not a problem).

I'm not able to understand the nature of the commit to identify what could be the problem. My nose tells me that it may be some stupid mistake, for example in some offset constant, that nobody ever saw because tcg-interpreter is not much used.

Thanks, Giovanni.
