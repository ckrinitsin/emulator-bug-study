Allow setting usb storage device ID parameters

Some stubborn software requires certain VID/PID/Serial to authenticate and refuses to start in emulation. This poses a problem with unsupported programs which often require keeping an ancient hardware praying that the USB stick will not die before the (often defunct) company making it.

Virtualizing such environment is desired. However, QEMU doesn't allow setting VID/PID/Serial/Name of emulated USB devices, but instead uses hardcoded values: https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/c99fa56b95a72f6debd50a280561895d078ae020/hw/usb/dev-storage.c#L95

This request (including a patch) was already made in 2015 on the list but never got any response: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-discuss/2015-07/msg00072.html


WDYT of adding such functionality?
