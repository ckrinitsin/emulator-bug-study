facing build error for qemu-4.0.0 on SUSE11 OS

I am trying to compile qemu-4.0.0 on suse11 OS and facing the following error on the console:
ERROR: sizeof(size_t) doesn't match GLIB_SIZEOF_SIZE_T.
       You probably need to set PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR
       to point to the right pkg-config files for your
       build target

Looking into the config.log file following is the error that is listed:

config-temp/qemu-conf.c:12:11: error: 'WACS_DEGREE' undeclared (first use in this function)
   add_wch(WACS_DEGREE);
           ^
config-temp/qemu-conf.c:12:11: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in

Following are the details of the tools versions:
OS version = SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (x86_64)
python = v2.7.10
glib = v2.56.1
gcc = v4.8.3
sdl2 = v2.0.12

Can someone help me understand the cause of this error?
