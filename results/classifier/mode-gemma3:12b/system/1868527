alignment may overlap the TLB flags

Hi,
In QEMU-4.2.0, or git-9b26a610936deaf436af9b7e39e4b7f0a35e4409, alignment may overlap the TLB flags. 
For example, the alignment: MO_ALIGN_32,
    MO_ALIGN_32 = 5 << MO_ASHIFT,
and the TLB flag: TLB_DISCARD_WRITE
#define TLB_DISCARD_WRITE   (1 << (TARGET_PAGE_BITS_MIN - 6))

then, in the function "get_alignment_bits", the assert may fail:

#if defined(CONFIG_SOFTMMU)
    /* The requested alignment cannot overlap the TLB flags.  */
    tcg_debug_assert((TLB_FLAGS_MASK & ((1 << a) - 1)) == 0);
#endif

However, the alignment of MO_ALIGN_32 is not used for now, so the assert cannot be triggered in current version. Anyway it seems like a potential conflict.
