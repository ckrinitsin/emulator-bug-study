Guest WinXP crashes when trying to use a USB spectrometer

I'm using Amadeus spectrometer (OceanOptics USB250) via Windows-based software "Quantum". I've tried six ways of attaching it to QEMU:

1. command line parameter "-device usb-host,hostbus=3,hostaddr=25"
2. command line parameter "-device usb-host,vendorid=0x2457,productid=0x1030"
3. command line parameter "-usbdevice host:2457:1030
4. command line parameter "-usbdevice host:3.25"
5. qemu console command "usb_add host:2457:1030"
5. qemu console command "usb_add host:3.25"

From these, only "-device ..." options work, i.e. numbers 1 and 2 in the list above, and all others lead to IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL BSOD in usbuhci.sys when I launch Quantum, which tries to start acquiring spectra.

I've also tried to reproduce the crash with a flash drive, but couldn't â€” it seems to work reliably in this case.
