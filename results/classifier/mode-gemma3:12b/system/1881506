TCG doesn't support a lot of features that should be supported

This is quite odd, and I'm not sure about how to get around it. I'm writing an OS in Rust and require APIC support. When I boot my kernel with qemu-system-x86_64, however, it dumps out a [lot] of warnings; it claims that TCG doesn't support FMA, X2APIC, AVX, F16C, AVX2, RDSEED, SHA-NI, FXSR-OPT, misalignsse, 3dnowprefetch, osvw, topoext, perfctr-core, clzero, xsaveerptr, ibpb, nrip-save, xsavec, and xsaves, but prints these warnings over 80 times before finally doing what I told it to do. Running QEMU 5.0.0 (unknown commit hash), as follows:
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=target\x86_64-kernel-none\debug\bootimage-kernel.bin -serial stdio -no-reboot -hdb disk.img -s -m 4G -usb -rtc base=utc,clock=host -cpu EPYC-v3,+acpi,+apic,+rdrand,+rdseed,+sse,+sse2,+sse4.1,+sse4.2,+sse4a,+ssse3,+syscall,+x2apic -smp cpus=8 -soundhw all
I would run using HAXM, but my kernel requires RDRAND, and QEMU does not, to my knowledge, automatically support RDRAND (and I don't know how to enable it).
