arm emulation of HCR.TID3 traps are not implemented

On ARM (aarch64), HCR_EL2.TID3 [bit18] is supposed to trap ID group 3, which includes the ID_AA64{PFR,DFR,ISAR,MMFR,AFR}*_EL1 registers. However, setting that HCR bit has no effect and accesses to those ID registers are not trapped to EL2 with an EC syndrome value of 0x18.
