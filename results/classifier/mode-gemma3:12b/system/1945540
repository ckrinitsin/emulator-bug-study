Description of problem

Java crashes as shown below:

$ java --version
#
# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
#
#  SIGILL (0x4) at pc=0x000003ff9f5fe6f4, pid=6789, tid=6818

# JRE version:  (17.0+35) (build )
# Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (17+35-snap, mixed mode, sharing,
# tiered, compressed oops, compressed class ptrs, g1 gc, linux-s390x)
# Problematic frame:
# C  [linux-vdso64.so.1+0x6f8]  __kernel_getcpu+0x8
#
# Core dump will be written. Default location: core.6789 (may not
# exist)
#
# An error report file with more information is saved as:
# /home/ubuntu/src/hs_err_pid6789.log
#
#
Aborted (core dumped)

Steps to reproduce

Run any Java program to reproduce the problem.

Because the 'openjdk' packages in Ubuntu run the 'java' command during installation, they hit the same error and fail to install. As an alternative, you can install the OpenJDK Snap package for the 's390x' architecture as follows:

  $ sudo snap install openjdk

The OpenJDK Snap package has been tested to work on a real IBM/S390 8561 system, namely the IBM LinuxONE III LT1 at Marist College:
