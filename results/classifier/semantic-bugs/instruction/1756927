ARMv7 LPAE: IFSR doesn't have the LPAE bit in case of BKPT

When a user application triggers a 'bkpt' instruction while LPAE is used, the bit [9] of IFSR is not correctly set during the prefetch abort exception.

You'll find attached a minimal example to reproduce the issue (just run 'make all').
The output I get is:

supervisor
user
prefetch
short-descriptor

The last entry should read 'long-descriptor'.

I've just sent this patchset:

which should fix this bug and a couple of others that I noticed with our debug exception handling while I was doing that.


thanks Peter ! Any news on the review ?

The patches are in master now.


Hi Peter,
