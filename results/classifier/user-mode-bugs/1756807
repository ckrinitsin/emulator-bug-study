performance regression in qemu-user + proot

To reproduce:

1. Install qemu-user-static and proot
2. Enter some arm chroot using them:

    proot -0 -q qemu-arm-static -w / -r chroot/ /bin/bash

3. Run a command which normally takes a short but measurable amount of time:

    cd /usr/share/doc && time grep -R hello

Result:

This is over 100 times slower on 18.04 than it was on 16.04. I am not sure if proot or qemu is causing the problem, but proot version has not changed. Also note that on 16.04 I am using the cloud repo version of qemu, which is newer than 16.04 stock, but still older than 18.04.

Although system 2 is lower spec than system 1, it should not be this much slower. No other software seems to be affected.

If required I can supply a chroot tarball. It is essentially just a Debian bootstrap though.
