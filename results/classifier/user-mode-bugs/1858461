Please refactor linux-user/mips/cpu_loop.c

Hello. I am working with qemu on test images. I've added a new syscall (436) to qemu but received ENOSYS from mips application.

Please open "linux-user/mips/cpu_loop.c". I've added at the end of "mips_syscall_args" the following:

```
MIPS_SYS(sys_getdents64_x32, 3)
```

But

```
syscall_num = env->active_tc.gpr[2] - 4000;
if (syscall_num >= sizeof(mips_syscall_args)) {
  ret = -TARGET_ENOSYS;
```

returns -TARGET_ENOSYS

We can see that "linux-user/mips/cpu_loop.c" differs a lot from "linux-user/arm/cpu_loop.c". Arm has it's own "ARM_NR_BASE" and etc.

Can you please refactor mips cpu loop in the same way as arm? Thank you.
