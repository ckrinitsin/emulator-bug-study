risc-v: 'c.unimp' instruction decoded as 'c.addi4spn fp, 0'

QEMU 3.1 incorrectly decodes the "c.unimp" instruction (opcode 0x0000) as an "addi4spn fp, 0" when either of the two following bytes are non-zero. This is because the ctx->opcode value used when decoding the instruction is actually filled with a 32-bit load (to handle normal uncompressed instructions) but when a compressed instruction is found only the low 16 bits are valid. Other reserved/illegal bit patterns with the addi4spn opcode are also incorrectly decoded.

I believe that the switch to decodetree on master happened to fix this issue, but hopefully it is helpful to have this recorded somewhere. I've included a simple one line patch if anyone wants to backport this.
