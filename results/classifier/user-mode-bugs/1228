-display curses only recognizes escape characters if pressed very quickly
Description of problem:
The system start and runs perfectly fine, but when I try to exit the escape commands does not seem to work.

I have tried all the ones from here:
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/keys.html
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/mux-chardev.html

When using the graphical display, the escape characters works as expected but when using -display curses, they do not.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start qemu with the command provided 
2. Try to exit using ctrl + x a - Not working
3. Try to exit using alt + 2 - Not working

The same issues occurs when running qemu on a Linux machine (Ubunt) via Visual Studio Code / ssh. 

I'm guessing this is a macOS specific issue or maybe something to do with my Locale (sv-SE).
Additional information:
Linux 0.01 build:

**Tests using showkey**

Alt + 2 from mobile ssh client (Terminus) -> Ubuntu machine
```
^[2      27 0033 0x1b
         50 0062 0x32
```

Option + 2 from macOS Terminal + ssh -> Ubuntu machine
```
@ 	 64 0100 0x40
```

Esc + 2 from macOS Terminal + ssh -> Ubuntu machine
```
^[ 	 27 0033 0x1b
2 	 50 0062 0x32
```

**Update**

It seems to work if I press ESC + 2 at exactly the same time.
