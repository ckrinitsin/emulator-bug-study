optical drive doesn't open in Lubuntu 18.04 on '12 MacPro

Running an install to HD of Lubuntu 18.04 and after running update/upgrade this morning now the optical drive door doesn't respond to keyboard "eject" key on a Mac keyboard for '12 MacPro . . . .  I tried to use "xfburn" to get the door to open, nothing seems to get it to work that I know of.  Yesterday there was no issue . . . .  Tried to run "apt -f install" and it showed some old kernels to "autoremove" . . . which I did; didn't try to reboot into old kernel to test, perhaps now old kernel is gone?

Sorry, I'm not sure if I understand you.

Does this bug have anything to do with QEMU? Are you running a virtual machine?

If so:
(A) What is your host OS, version, and QEMU version?
(B) What is your guest OS and version?
(C) What are you trying to do, and
(D) What is the expected behavior?

@John Snow:

Don't know on the "QEMU" front, this is install to HD partitions of Lu
18.04 . . . while trying to burn an iso to DVD, pressing the "eject"
keyboard button will not open the open drive door, so no DVD can be put
there . . . problem remains in Lu.  Whereas I have a couple installs of
OpenSUSE & OSX and the keyboard "eject" button works without issue . . . .


You probably meant to file this bug against a different component, you've filed it against QEMU which is an emulator/hypervisor for VMs.

@John:

Thanks for the clarification . . . don't know how that happened, although
it is very obtuse as far as even getting to the "report a bug filing" place
. . . but I didn't select QEMU or even mention that in my comments . . . .
Any way to change that in this bug number, or it has to be a "fresh" start?
