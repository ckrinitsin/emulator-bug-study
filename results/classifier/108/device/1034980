pseries machine: vscsi scsi qemu cd-rom does not work in win32

On Win32, the cd-rom device is not detected at all in the pseries machine (SLOF):
   
   qemu-system-ppc64 -M pseries -m 512 -cdrom img.iso
      ....etc.
   VSCSI: Looking for disks
   Populating /pci@800000020000001,0


On Linux however, the scsi qemu cd-rom device is detected and works fine in the pseries machine:

   qemu-system-ppc64 -M pseries -m 512 -cdrom img.iso
      ....etc.
   VSCSI: Looking for disks
      SCSI ID 2 CD-ROM   : "QEMU     QEMU CD-ROM      1.1."
   Populating /pci@800000020000001,0

This started to work in version 1.2, thanks!

Closing this bug, since it is working now according to comment #1
