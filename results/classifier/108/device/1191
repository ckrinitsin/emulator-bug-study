AC97+CoreAudio no audio when out frequency not 44,1KHz & always forces host to use 44,1KHz (or less if frequency not supported)
Description of problem:
AC97+CoreAudio outputs no audio when output frequency not 44,1KHz. Also always forces host to use 44,1KHz (or less if frequency not supported on host output)
Steps to reproduce:
1. Boot any OS with (only) AC97 audio on macOS
2. Attempt to play audio with output frequency in guest set to 48KHz
3. Observe lack of output
Additional information:
I'm using QEMU to test a Custom OS written by me, but this shouldn't be a code issue on our side, rather an issue with QEMU itself, if this is mistaken, please inform us.
