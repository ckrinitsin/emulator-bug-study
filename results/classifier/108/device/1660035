hw/timer/altera_timer.c:207: bad size in memset ?

hw/timer/altera_timer.c:207:5: warning: ‘memset’ used with length equal to number of elements without multiplication by element size [-Wmemset-elt-size]

Source code is

     memset(t->regs, 0, ARRAY_SIZE(t->regs));

Maybe better code

     memset(t->regs, 0, R_MAX * sizeof( uint32_t));

Better still -- just memset(t->regs, 0, sizeof(t->regs));

Chris, could you send a patch to fix this, please?

thanks

This problem should have been fixed with QEMU v2.10.0:
