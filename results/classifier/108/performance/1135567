QXL crashes a Windows 7 guest if host goes into screensaver

Note: if further information is required, I'll be glad to supply it.

I am using on the host
- HP z800 with 72GB RAM and 2x x5680
- Gentoo 64-bit host (3.7.9 kernel, FGLRX RADEON driver 13.1)
- LIBVIRT 1.0.2 with QEMU(-KVM) 1.4.0

The guest:
- Windows 7 32-bit
- 2GB allocated
- 2 CPU
- using virtio for everything (disk,net,memballoon)
- Display = SPICE with spice channel
- Video driver is qxl (ram says 64MB)
- Spice-guest-tools 0.52 installed

When I use QXL and  have the guest open in Virt-Manager/Virt-Viewer and let the host go into screensaver mode, the Win7 crashes hard.

When I change video to VGA, it survives the screen saver,  no problem at all ,smooth sailing.

regards

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Hello, 

Obviously my hardware configuration and versions etc. have changed. 

Also, I have taken to not using screensavers in the virtual machines anymore i.e. disabled.

BUT: I have set it up as similarly as possible and the crash/freeze/hang up with current versions of the drivers seems to be gone.

So I guess the ticket can be closed.

Thanks for checking! ... so I'm closing this ticket now.
