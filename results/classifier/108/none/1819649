Win10 Preview Build 18351 - no input

The issue exists in both 2.12.1 and current master (built 8.3.2019). Neither keyboard nor mouse input seems to work and there's no cursor available (VNC, SPICE, SDL tested). If all the 'hv_*' flags are removed input works again.

In the attachments you can find a simple script to reproduce it (requires the ISO path to be changed).



I can confirm this issue and it also happens with the next (most recent as of today) Windows 10 19h1 insider build number 18353.

Interestingly, only the x64 version is affected. The 32 bit insider preview seems to work fine with the hv_flags you've provided.


For anyone trying to reproduce this issue:

The easiest way to create an insider iso image is using the scripts from https://uupdump.ml/ which uses  the open source aria2 download utility and a conversion script to build the iso from original Microsoft files.

E.g. in order to create the Windows 10 x64 19h1 insider build 18353 iso:

# install dependencies for the conversion script
sudo apt-get install aria2 cabextract wimtools chntpw genisoimage
# download the zip with the download links and conversion scripts for the desired windows edition (get the url from https://uupdump.ml/)
wget 'https://uupdump.ml/get.php?id=d3a6af86-214e-4421-a38b-bd4ede09d74e&pack=en-us&edition=0&autodl=2' -O download_and_convert.zip
# unpack, inspect, download and convert
unzip download_and_convert.zip
chmod +x aria2_download_linux.sh
./aria2_download_linux.sh
# now you have the 18353.1_MULTI_X64_EN-US.ISO


Update: Bug is still present with yesterday's released Windows 10 19H1 Insider Preview Build 18356 x64.
The x86 version still works fine however.

I guess this will soon get urgent since Microsoft will release Windows 1903 sometime in March/April. 

Issue seems to be fixed with Windows 10 19H1 Insider Preview Build 18361 !

Quoting from Microsoft's Changelog:
"We fixed an issue preventing certain VMs from being able to install or update Windows Insider Preview builds ..."

Seems this was no qemu issue after all, please close.
