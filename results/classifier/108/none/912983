Unable to install OS/2 Warp v3 past disk 2

To whom it may concern,

As you may (or may not) be aware, QEMU is currently unable to readily install OS/2 Warp v3 (OS2W3) when asked for Installation Diskette 2 (http://www.claunia.com/qemu/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=132&iTestingId=138).

QEMU 0.8.2 is the last known (to me) release to successfully install OS2W3. QEMU version 1.0 and the latest development version (as of 2012-01-05) have been verified not to work.

A 'git bisect' reveals the issue was introduced during a migration to new removable media handling prior to the QEMU 0.9.0 release:

	There are only 'skip'ped commits left to test.
	The first bad commit could be any of:
	66c6ef7678939f2119eb649074babf5d5b2666f6
	ea185bbda732dae6b6a5a44699f90c83e21f1494
	19cb37389f4641d48803f0c5d72708749cbcf318
	We cannot bisect more!

For testing, the 'qcow' hard drive format was chosen due to QEMU 0.8.2 not having 'qcow2':

	$ qemu -M isapc -m 8 -localtime -soundhw sb16 -hda os2.qcow -fda install.img -boot a

Of note, the ISA-only PC (isapc) was needed for QEMU 0.8.2 to 0.9.0. Otherwise QEMU hangs on start-up. Later versions of QEMU, segmentation fault when attempting to use '-M isapc' though boot correctly when using the default PC machine.


The currently preferred method to install OS2W3 is to use another application (such as VirtualBox or VMWare), using a QEMU compatible disk image format. Once installed, QEMU can then run OS2W3; which it does phenomenally well.

However, I've identified a way to install OS2W3 exclusively with QEMU, which may also shed additional light on the issue.

1. Using a relatively new QEMU (I'm on 0.11.1), install OS2W3 as you normally would on to a 'qcow2' hard drive.
2. When Installation Diskette 2 is reached, save a VM snapshot.
3. Quit QEMU and re-run, loading the VM state *with* the Installation Diskette 2 image in the floppy drive.
	$ qemu -m 8 -localtime -soundhw sb16 -hda os2.qcow2 -fda disk2.img -loadvm install 
The installation process will then continue as normal.

This same method can be used once OS2W3 continues installing from it's GUI. Installation Diskette 7 experiences the same issue of not being recognised when inserted.

Of note, as an unrelated issue, I was unable to save VM snapshots in QEMU 1.0 or later.


Thank you for a fantastic emulator.


cheers,

Triaging old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU?
