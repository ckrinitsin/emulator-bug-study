qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0x6003ddc5

During the build of gedit for RISC-V this error occurs:

$ qemu-riscv64 -E LD_LIBRARY_PATH=gedit/.libs ./gedit/.libs/gedit
qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0x6003ddc5
qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0x600009e4

https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/openSUSE:Factory:RISCV/gedit/standard/riscv64

Possibly duplicate of bug #1594394, in which case it would be worth testing with 5.0.0 or above..

Actually more likely https://github.com/vivier/qemu-m68k/issues/33, in which case it's also fixed..

As you can see in the build log the package builds sucessfully.
