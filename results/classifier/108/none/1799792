Broken scaling with gtk,gl=on on a hidpi display

Tested on QEMU 3.0.0 on Arch Linux.

I'm using a hidpi screen, and therefore use those environment variables in order to have GTK+ apps properly scaled:

GDK_SCALE=2
GDK_DPI_SCALE=0.5

However, QEMU, when launched with "-display gtk,gl=on" option, doesn't scale the window content properly, as seen on the attached screenshot.

Switching to "-display gtk,gl=off" and "-display sdl,gl=on" makes it work fine.



Also happens on Ubuntu 19.10

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Still happening in QEMU 5.1.0

I have the same issue, but unfortunately I cannot work around it: gl=off doesn't work with vfio-display-dmabuf, and sdl segfaults when the guest OS tries to enter GUI.

unset GDK_SCALE GDK_DPI_SCALE works for me. It was GDK_SCALE=2 GDK_DPI_SCALE=0.5 as KDE would have set.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
