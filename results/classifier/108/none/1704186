no option for handling ^C in stdio

There is no way to tell qemu to handle (or not) ^C on standard input.

This makes using serial console on stdio needlessly annoying and difficult.

The code is there - depending on how you set up the console it may handle the signal or not.

That's completely backwards. The behavior should be the same regardless of how you set up console *and* there should be a separate option for handling ^C.

You can select the behavior of ^C when specifying "-chardev stdio,signal=[on|off]". See also https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/invocation.html#hxtool-6
