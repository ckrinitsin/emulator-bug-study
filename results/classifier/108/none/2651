MPC5553/MPC5554 Emulation (information request)
Additional information:
If it is not planned, I'll most likely start educating myself on this project to try and patch it in as it's a need that is quite important for me.
I'll try not to waste your time and read as much as I can about your guidelines.
Would you advise me against trying to do this?
I'd like to know how hard you think this will be.

DISCLAIMER : I am still very much a newbie in embedded systems, I'm only in the first year of my master's degree in embedded systems.
