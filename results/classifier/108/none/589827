QEMU netdev tap type id name is not used on linux host

Tested with 0.12.3, 0.12.4, and latest git as of 4 jun 2010.
The new -netdev type seems to ignore manual specifications of tap ifname.

    qemu-system-x86_64 -hda disk.img -netdev tap,id=ids_e0 -device e1000,netdev=ids_e0
 **creates tap0 instead of ids_e0.  tap0 passes traffic, ids_e0 doesn't exist
(I tried -netdev type=tap as well for brevity)

QEMU creates a tap0 (or appropriate) interface and does not name this "ids_e0" as would be expected.  I also tried 'pre' creating the tap interface.

Previous alterantive was
    qemu-system-x86_64 -hda disk.img -net nic,model=e1000,vlan=99 -net tap,ifname=ids_e0,vlan=99 
  **creates ids_e0 as expected, and passes traffic as expected.

Thanks to IRC, the correct syntax is: -netdev tap,id=asa1_eth0_tap,ifname=asa1_eth0_tap -device e1000,netdev=asa1_eth0_tap,mac=00:aa:cd:dd:01:01

(noted, fd=h option doesn't work on -netdev)


The "id=..." is only the QEMU-internal name of the netdev, not the name of the tap device. So this is not a bug --> closing this ticket.
