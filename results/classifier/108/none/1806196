qed leaked clusters

There are example of two QED files which AFAIK does not have errors both. But qemu-img check say that one of them has 1 leaked cluster.

I wrote my own tool and it does not find any error. Both files attached, as well as debug output from my program.

Both files are about 4G in size after unpacking. Unpack with tar -S to handle sparse files.

And also, I know, that QED is deprecated, but anyway, seems qemu-img has bug.



Thanks for reporting this.  QED is not widely used and its features have been incorporated into qcow2, QEMU's native image format.  Since there is no development effort behind QED it is unlikely that this bug will be addressed.  Patches are always welcome though!

I think, this bug also can be triggered in qcow2. Unfortunately it is not so easy for me to find roots of the bug.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
