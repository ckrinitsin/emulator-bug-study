fdisk still shows the "/dev/sdb" partitions even after the removal of scsi disk

RHEL guest shows the partittions even after the removal of scsi disk:
fdisk still shows the "/dev/sdb" partitions even after the removal of scsi disk.

Guest details:
-------------------
Kernel : 2.6.32-358


Host Details :

Upstream Kernel, Qemu, Libvirt and virt-manager
---------------------------------------------------------------------

kernel version : 3.9.0+
qemu version : QEMU emulator version 1.5.0
libvirt version : 1.0.5
virt-install : 0.600.3


Steps to reproduce the issue:

I. Add the SCSI disk through the virt-manager.
2. Create the partition using fdisk  (eg: /dev/sbb) 
3. Create a filesystem and format using mkfs.ext3 or mkfs.ext4 
4. Remove the scsi disk  through the virt-manager. 
5. Again run the fdisk /dev/sdb, the guests still shows the partition even after the removal of the disk.

This issue is not seen with virt-io disk.

This issue is also reproducible without even creating the partitions.

Expected Result:

The output of fdisk /dev/sd*  should not show the enties after the removal of scsi disks

Which emulated SCSI controller are you using?  Recent virtio-scsi gets
notified when LUNs are removed but you may have old guest drivers.

If you want to report this as a QEMU bug, please give QEMU commands, not
virt-manager commands.  If you cannot use QEMU directly, please work
with the virt-manager or libvirt community before filing a QEMU bug so
the necessary QEMU-level details can be provided by them.
