support horisontal mouse wheel

Brad Jorsch provided a series of patches to support horisontal mouse scrolling in qemu-emulated mouse.
See Debian bug#579968 -- http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=579968 and submission to qemu-devel list at http://<email address hidden>/msg30991.html .


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
