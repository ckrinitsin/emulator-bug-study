Windows 7 guest cannot boot after seabios updated

Hi,

I can no longer boot my Windows 7 guest after this commit (update seabios to latest master)

http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=01afdadc92e71e29700e64f3a5f42c1c543e3cf9

When I tried to boot Windows, it BSOD and said "The BIOS in this system is not fully ACPI compliant. Please contact your system vendor for an updated  BIOS". Reverting this commit will fix the issue.

Not yet.  My win7 32bit guests boots fine.  Installing 64bit version
right now to see how that behaves, at least the windows setup booted
just fine too.

cheers,
  Gerd


I have tried both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 7, both have the same issue. But I can also boot into the Window 7 setup. I have tried to use the repair option but it cannot repair it. I then recreated the partion and do a fresh installation and it then boots fine. So this issue only affects the guest which was installed before the BIOS update.

I am now trying to reinstall a new instance without the BIOS update, then update the BIOS after that to see if I can reproduce the issue.

I cannot reproduce the issue with newly created image, so looks like this is not a qemu bug, but just a problem of my corrupted image. Sorry for the noise, please close the issue and I will report another one if I find other things.

Closing, according to comment #5.
