[UBUNTU 20.04] KVM guest fails to find zipl boot menu index

---Problem Description---
A KVM guest fails to find the zipl boot menu index if the "zIPL" magic value is listed at the end of a disk block. 
 
---System Hang---
System sits in disabled wait, last console display
LOADPARM=[        ]
Using virtio-blk.
Using ECKD scheme (block size  4096), CDL
VOLSER=[0X0067]
 
 
---Steps to Reproduce---
1. Install Distro KVM guest from ISO on a DASD, e.g. using virt-install, my invocation was 
$ virt-install --name secguest2 --memory 2048 --disk path=/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.af6a --cdrom /var/lib/libvirt/images/xxxxxx.iso

2. Select DHCP networking and ASCII console, and accept all defaults of the installer

3. Let the installer reboot after the installation completes

It is possible to recover by editing the domain XML with an explicit loadparm to select a boot menu entry. E.g. I changed the disk definition to
   <disk type='block' device='disk'>
      <driver name='qemu' type='raw' cache='none' io='native'/>
      <source dev='/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.af6a'/>
      <target dev='vda' bus='virtio'/>
      <boot order='1' loadparm='1'/>
      <address type='ccw' cssid='0xfe' ssid='0x0' devno='0xaf6a'/>
    </disk>

The patches are now upstream:
5f97ba0c74cc ("pc-bios/s390-ccw: fix off-by-one error")
468184ec9024 ("pc-bios/s390-ccw: break loop if a null block number is reached")

Just to avoid any bad surprise, these patches require a rebuild of the bios image so the binary must also be updated.

This already is in upstream qemu 5.2, thereby Hirsute is fixed already.
I'll prep PPAs for a try for Focal/Groovy in a bit

PPA is here: https://launchpad.net/~ci-train-ppa-service/+archive/ubuntu/4504

Would you mind to check if this really is enough and all that you'd need?
Once that is confirmed I can prep this for the SRU process.

Hi @Christan B. :-)
With "rebuild of the bios image" I guess you meant:
  /usr/share/qemu/s390-ccw.img
  /usr/share/qemu/s390-netboot.img
Those are built from the same source, so fixing and building src:qemu fixes this in one go.

If you had other binaries in mind let me know.

Yes I had these 2 in mind.
I was not sure if Ubuntu always builds these files or if you use the pre-build ones.

Hi,
I have tested this with:
$ virt-install --name testinst1 --memory 2048 --disk path=/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.151e --cdrom /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-18.04.5-server-s390x.iso

But while the issue itself and the fix is clear, this did not trigger the issue.
In my case the reboot after install worked just fine even without the fix.
Might I ask:
- which "xxxxxx.iso" it is in your example that has issues with this?
- which disk setup did you select on install (that is then put onto the dasd by the installer)
- what should I expect in the error case, I expected a fail or hang on reboot but got:

```
The system is going down NOW!
Sent SIGTERM to all processes
Sent SIGKILL to all processes
Requesting system reboot

Domain creation completed.ts; <Enter> activates buttons
Restarting guest.
Connected to domain testinst1
Escape character is ^]

Booting entry #0
[    0.450525] Linux version 4.15.0-140-generic (buildd@bos02-s390x-010) (gcc version 7.5.0 (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04)) #144-Ubuntu SMP Fri Mar 19 14:11:29 UTC 2021 (Ubuntu 4.15.0-140.144-
generic 4.15.18)
```

```
The config (in regard to boot) that virtinst left (and that worked) was:
  <os>
    <type arch='s390x' machine='s390-ccw-virtio-focal'>hvm</type>
    <boot dev='hd'/>
  </os>
...
    <disk type='block' device='disk'>
      <driver name='qemu' type='raw' cache='none' io='native'/>
      <source dev='/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.151e' index='2'/>
      <backingStore/>
      <target dev='vda' bus='virtio'/>
      <alias name='virtio-disk0'/>
      <address type='ccw' cssid='0xfe' ssid='0x0' devno='0x0000'/>
    </disk>
```

I agree to the fix, but need a reasonable testcase that works (also to explain to the SRU team why this is a realistic issue someone would hit).

Could I skip all the install description and just take a existing guest running on a dasd and then use a custom zipl.conf to trigger this? If so which zipl.conf would you recommend?

This was a non Ubuntu distribution. It can happen on any distro that has the s390-tools commit/patch "zipl: Make use of __noreturn macro" and not the fix  "zipl/libc: libc_stop move 'noreturn' to declaration"

I spoke to cborntra, and it turned out that this affects only guests with zipl
with:        86856f98 "zipl: Make use of __noreturn macro"
but not yet: c367a6bb "zipl/libc: libc_stop move 'noreturn' to declaration"

That means 2.12/2.13 and that translates to Focal.
Therefore retry this as:

ubuntu@s1lp5:~$ virt-install --name testinst2 --memory 2048 --disk path=/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.151e --cdrom /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-20.04-legacy-server-s390x.iso
- all defaults -
- install as "entire disk -

Then on reboot I get still what seems working:

```
The system is going down NOW!
Sent SIGTERM to all processes
Sent SIGKILL to all processes
Requesting system reboot

Domain creation completed.ts; <Enter> activates buttons
Restarting guest.
Connected to domain testinst2
Escape character is ^]

Booting entry #0
```

We talked further and it is also compiler specific.
Eventually any guest "could" fail and it definitely is wise to fix this.
Just verification gets harder.

I'll try some other ISOs as instructed by Christian to see if one can be used as repro case.


This iso should do the trick "SLE-15-SP2-Full-s390x-GM-Media1.iso" to reproduce.

Yep exactly. Without the ISO it's harder to reproduce... Because then you have to (AFAICR):
1. patch your zipl code so the stage loader (I think it was stage2) has the right size
2. use this patched zipl for zipl'ing the DASD
3. use qemu to boot from this DASD

FYI - uploaded to the -unapproved queue yesterday. Now on the SRU team to evaluate.

FYI I'm working on the autopkgtest issues - but all of those are known flaky cases, so I expect no long term blocker.

The other two bugs that are part of this SRU are verified by now, so it needs just this one to complete - which we know can be hard to re-create without special unlucky bootloader record sizes.

On the good side, I've not seen regressions to the non-affected-boots

@Marc - let us know once you've completed the testing

FYI - autopkgtest issues resolved as well now (as assumed it was due to flaky tests)

@Christian: I've verified the fix works.

Thanks (we have had way too much non-fun with no debug symbols on the roms, bootloader record sizes and so on).
I really appreciate that you went so deep on this Marc!

The verification of the Stable Release Update for qemu has completed successfully and the package is now being released to -updates.  Subsequently, the Ubuntu Stable Release Updates Team is being unsubscribed and will not receive messages about this bug report.  In the event that you encounter a regression using the package from -updates please report a new bug using ubuntu-bug and tag the bug report regression-update so we can easily find any regressions.
