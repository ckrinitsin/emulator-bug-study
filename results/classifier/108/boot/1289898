qemu-system-ppc64 easily cause file corruption

the qemu-system-ppc64 is used to run Fedora-19 on RHEL 5.3.
Previously I was using QEMU 1.5.x for several months with no problem. But after the RHEL 5.3 host damaged, and rebuilt, now I tried both QEMU 1.6.2 and QEMU 1.7.0, found both can easily cause file corruptions. Symptoms:

* using scp to transfer a tar.bz file from the RHEL 5.3 host to the Fedora-19 PPC VM, found the size is correct, but the content is corrupted from the middle of the 80+ MB file.  re-transfer again, got a correct file. But after untar, found some extracted files corrupted.
The extracted file corruption happened several times, and also the filesystem in the VM had corrupted several times, had to restore the boot image to recover.

Correction, the qemu-system-ppc64 is running a VM for RHEL5.9 for PPC, not fedora-19.

Hi, any chance you could try the latest snapshot from git?  It has a lot of PPC64 changes. Also, please pass your QEMU command line.

I used the following way to start the VM:

#!/bin/bash
ifconfig -a|grep tap0 >/dev/null 2>&1 || qemu-ifup tap0

qemu-system-ppc64 -hda ppcrhel5.img -cpu POWER7 -machine type=pseries,usb=off -m 768 -nographic -net nic -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no
qemu-ifdown tap0

I found a CentOS 6.4 machine which has QEMU 1.5.3, and copied the ppcrhel5.img to that machine, and tested, found it's reliable, and no such file and filesystem easy corruption issue. So, it's the 1.6.2 and 1.7.0 have the problem.

I can't test from git: on one box with git, it failed for the pixman missing. and the RHEL 5.3 doesn't have git.

Did you try the git submodule command that configure
suggests when it can't find pixman? That will pull
in and build a local copy of pixman for QEMU.

thanks

Also, RHEL5 does have git in the EPEL repository.

On my RHEL 5.3 box, there are too many problems to get git work. And on the CentOS 6.4 it has many problem to get pixman, so I just can't test the latest qemu unless you also put the pixman in as 1.7.0 does.

Yes, I tried that, but it failed due to some php component missing.

and lots of dependency issue .

After got qemu 2.3.0, I tested on CentOS6.6, the qemu-system-ppc64 also causes filesystem corruption for the big endian RHEL5.9 for power. So this should confirm the qemu for ppc has bug from at least 1.7 onward.

And seems no developer cares about this issue.

Is this the same issue as bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1463812 ? If so, I think we should close one of the two tickets - no need to track an issue twice.
