changelog 4.1 krenel typo

The changelog for 4.1 subsection Arm has a typo (krenel --> kernel)
https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/4.1#Arm

At the following line:
The i.mx7 PCI controller emulation has been improved so it can boot current Linux krenels 

it should be:
The i.mx7 PCI controller emulation has been improved so it can boot current Linux kernels

Thanks for this report -- I've just updated the changelog page to fix the typo.
