qemu crashes on Darwin in qemu_iohandler_poll

I have an issue when I try to run qemu-system-arm on Mac OS X. 
Sometime between 1 and 15 secs after qemu is started it crashes
as shown bellow.

Same thing on linux host works fine.

Is anybody else experiencing this?
Any Hints?

Thanks,

Damjan

fter bisection seems that this starts happening after following patch:

However before this patch qemu doesn't respond to keyboard (i.e. commit 31b7c261).

Last full working commit is 630ecca.


I am seeing the same think when I try to run a sample built under gcc from the TI tools

117	void qemu_iohandler_poll(fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds, fd_set *xfds, int ret)
118	{
119	    if (ret > 0) {
120	        IOHandlerRecord *pioh, *ioh;
121	
122	        QLIST_FOREACH_SAFE(ioh, &io_handlers, next, pioh) {
(gdb) l
123	            if (!ioh->deleted && ioh->fd_read && FD_ISSET(ioh->fd, readfds)) {
124	                ioh->fd_read(ioh->opaque);
125	            }

(gdb) print ioh
$2 = (IOHandlerRecord *) 0x5

However Peter Maydell sent me a kernel image that runs fine on OS X.  However when I try to run it under gdb I get the same problem that you see.

Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU, or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
