QEMU crash after sending data on host serial port

Good morning,

I'm using QEMU for Windows last version.
The host system is Windows 7 64bits.
I'm excuting the following statment :

qemu-system-x86_64w.exe -hda debian.img -m 256 -net nic -net tap,ifname=TAP32 -soundhw all -serial COM9

Qemu starts the emulated Debian and it runs correctly.

If I try to send data from Windows using COM9 to QEMU (both "real" or emulated by the COM0COM driver), QEMU crashes. Windows dump available if required.
If I try to send data to /dev/ttyS0 (that should be the Linux side of COM9) from Debian, again, the wirtual machine crashes.

More details if necessary
Best regards
U.Poddine

Please post details of the crash including the backtrace.  That might be
enough information for someone to figure out the problem and send a
patch to fix it.


Hello Stefan,

the crash can be described better as a neverending loop started after having 
received data on serial ports, infact for going out I'm forced to kill the QEMU 
session from Windows. As result there is unfortunately  no system dump in the 
Windows dump folder.
I've tried to generate the backtrace with Windbg (attached), it shows 
something before sending data to COM and after having killed the neverednding 
loop, this in both cases : sending data from Windows to COM port (first 
backtrace) and sending data from linux to /dev/pty port.
I'm afraid that the dumps are not so rich, due to the neverending loop problem 
: I'm not able to debug better the situation.
Let me know if I can help more

Regards
UP

Hello,

after having upgraded QEMU to the end-of-February release, the problem (still there) evolved.
Now there is no more a "nevereding loop", but QEMU crashes on stratup with the above described startup command :

qemu-system-x86_64w.exe -hda debian.img -m 256 -net nic -net
> tap,ifname=TAP32 -soundhw all -serial COM9

Now it's easy to give you the Windows dump, attached.

Regards
Ugo

Hi All

I also meet this issue.
 I have two computer, one is Win7 32 another is Win7 64, Both computer meet this issue.
My QEMU version is qemu-w32-setup-20160215

I want used EDK2 OVMF with Intel UDK Debugger tools to do source level debug
I had install com0com Virtual Com Port, and set COM3 connect to COM4

Intel UDK Debugger tools used COM3
QEMU run OVMF used COM4

First execute Intel UDK Debugger tools, then launch QEMU
C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe -bios "C:\EDK2\Build\OvmfX64\DEBUG_VS2010\FV\OVMF.fd" -serial COM4
Then QEMU crashes on stratup

I have do some experiment
Execute terminal tool Tera Term and used COM3
launch QEMU and used COM4
C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe -bios "C:\EDK2\Build\OvmfX64\DEBUG_VS2010\FV\OVMF.fd" -serial COM4
This is fine and i can see OVMF trace log on terminal 
But if i press "Down" key on terminal, then QEMU crashe
It's caused by terminal send data("Down" key) to QEMU

Have somebody can share some information about this?

Thanks a lot.
Sugar

Looks like the bug still exists. Sending eg "CTRL+D" or Arrow up/down makes qemu hang indefinitely
