qemu-user x86_64 x86 gdb call function from gdb doesn't work

While running qemu user x86_64 x86 with gdb server, calling functions are not working.

Here is how to reproduce it:

run in a terminal:
$ qemu-x86_64 -g 12345 -L / /bin/ls

In another terminal run gdb:
(gdb) file /bin/ls
(gdb) target remote :12345
(gdb) b _init
(gdb) c
(gdb) call malloc(1)
Could not fetch register "fs_base"; remote failure reply 'E14'

In other cases we also got the error:
Could not fetch register "orig_rax"; remote failure reply 'E14'

Here is how I patched it (it is only a workaround):

diff --git a/gdbstub.c b/gdbstub.c
index 2a94030..5749efe 100644

+++ b/gdbstub.c

+#elif TARGET_I386

     return 0;
 }

(Our guess for this issue was, gdb is requesting for 'fake' registers to know register size)

Once we patched that, we got another problem while calling functions from gdb: We could call functions, but only once.

Here is how to reproduce it:
run in a terminal:
$ qemu-x86_64 -g 12345 -L / /bin/ls

In another terminal run gdb:
(gdb) file /bin/ls

(gdb) c
(gdb) call malloc(1)
$1 = (void *) 0x620010

Here is how we patched it to make it work:

             if (!(p = lock_user(VERIFY_WRITE, addr, l, 0)))

From what we saw, there is a page which is passed to read-only after first execution, and gdb need to write on that page to put a breakpoint. (on the stack)

We suspect this is linked to this:
https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/2012/2012-06-28/qemu-tech.html#Self_002dmodifying-code-and-translated-code-invalidation

I have verified the second issue: the second call of function gives error "Cannot access memory at address".
I have tried it for various architectures. It is same for mips. But it works for aarch64.

It seems the issue is related to gdb code: set_gdbarch_call_dummy_location (gdbarch, ON_STACK);

What is going on?
The breakpoint is stored on stack and for the first time the address has a flag PAGE_WRITE.
After a call, the address does not have anymore the flag PAGE_WRITE. It is changed in method tb_page_add() (file: accel/tcg/translate-all.c).

I am thinking more about gdbstub.c.
If there is handled packet M for writing data to memory, it should always write data to given address.
Reason: you are debugging and you want to verify various scenarios, so changing different values on different places may be needed.


The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
