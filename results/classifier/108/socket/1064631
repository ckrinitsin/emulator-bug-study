Feature request: tls for chardev socket (telnet,tcp,udp)

Hello,

it would be nice if chardev socket (telnet,tcp,udp) could have tls support as vnc does.

This way we could have encrypted access to virtual character devices over network,
for example in setup: conserver -> socat+tls <-> qemu+chardev+tls.

The best would be both direction - server even client, so even the client should
trust remote server (trustfile, fingeprint...?).

Thank you.

This support was introduced in QEMU 2.6 last year. Some info here:
