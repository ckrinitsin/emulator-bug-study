Qemu slirp connectivity lost when host enters vpn(openvpn or wireguard)
Description of problem:
No connectivity after host enters a vpn, tested with valid openvpn
and wireguard.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the vpn.
2. Open a virtual machine using slirp
3. Ping 8.8.8.8(if you can...)
Additional information:
The bug is independent on the order of execution, if you start the vm
to see it works, and run the vpn script, the connectivity in the vm
will drop, and come back when the tunneled connection is over.
