target-arm/translate-a64.c:2028: possible coding error ?

target-arm/translate-a64.c:2028:37: warning: ?: using integer constants in boolean context [-Wint-in-bool-context]

Source code is

        bool iss_sf = opc == 0 ? 32 : 64;

Maybe better code

        bool iss_sf = (opc == 0) ? 32 : 64;

This is clearly a bug, but your suggested change won't deal with the problem, which is that we're trying to set a bool so the ? 32 : 64 construct is just wrong.

Edgar, did you want to look at a fix for this? It was introduced
in your commit aaa1f954d4 adding syndrome info for loads and stores.

thanks

Hi Peter,

Yes, I've just posted a fix to the list.
It should have been:

bool iss_sf = opc == 0 ? false : true;

Cheers,
Edgar


Now fixed in master, commit 173ff58580b383a7841.


Released with v2.8
