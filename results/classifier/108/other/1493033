memory leak/high memory usage with spice webdav feature

This bug is being open due the comment:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91350#c9

Description of problem:
When copying big files from client to guest, the memory usage in the host grows by about the size of the file. This is partially spice problem due the memory pool being able to increase as much as necessary without a limit which should be handled by the patches sent in the mailing list [0]

[0] http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/spice-devel/2015-August/021644.html

At the same time, massif shows high memory usage by qemu as well [1] (output attached)

[1] (peak)

The file being shared was a 320M ogv video.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
QEMU emulator version 2.3.93
SPICE and SPICE-GTK: from git master

How reproducible:
100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1-) build spice-gtk with --enable-webdav=yes
2-) enable webdav in your VM by following:
https://elmarco.fedorapeople.org/manual.html#_folder_sharing
3-) using remote-viewer with webdav patches, connects to a fedora guest
4-) Open nautilus, go to 'Browse Network'
5-) On remote-viewer, enable shared folder by File > Preferences > [X] Share folder
6-) The spice client folder should appear: Double-click to mount it.
7-) Check the memory of your qemu process
8-) Copy a big file (let's say, 300 MB) from the shared folder to local VM
9-) See the memory consumption of qemu grows by a lot;

Actual results:
Memory usage grows during copy and is not freed

Expected results:
Memory should have an upper limit to grow and should be freed after copy

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU and spice? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
