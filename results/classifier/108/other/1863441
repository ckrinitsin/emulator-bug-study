cmd_mode_sense always reports 0x70, no CDROM present

cmd_mode_sense
  https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=hw/ide/atapi.c;hb=refs/heads/master#l852
always reports 0x70 in byte 2 returned, indicating no CD-ROM present.

If CD-ROM is present, should report 0x01 (or 0x11).
If CD-ROM absent, should report 0x70.

Hi, if you can quote the relevant spec, would you like to include that in a commit message and send a patch?

Also, does this result in a bug anywhere visible that we can test against?

Since I posted this bug report, I have done a little more research and this specific part of this command is actually quite obsolete.  It use to be documented (MMC v1.2 Draft), but later versions have actually removed this part of the command, even stating "obsolete" in some of the documentation.

If you want to still allow it, it actually does state 0x70 is an empty drive.  However, being it is so obsolete, you may wish to change this status to closed.

Thanks for asking.  I don't mind if you close this bug report.

Roger that, thanks!

I don't think we're very careful about which version we try to emulate. In practice it's "Whatever seems to work across the largest swatch of guest operating systems simultaneously".

If this comes up again, feel free to file against a specific guest OS that appears to be non-functioning.

Thanks!
