Keyboard input not working when the "-k en-us" argument is specified.

This bug occurs on qemu compiled with i386_softmmu and x86-64_softmmu on linux kernel 3.5.0.
Whenever I run qemu (both i386 and x86_64) to use the en-us language (even though it is the default), I get "Warning: no scancode found for keysym X" (X is an integer).
In the disk image I need qemu to run, I had a shell set up.  The shell doesn't register keyboard input when the '-k en-us' command line argument is set when running qemu. I did not have this problem with earlier versions of qemu.

I think I stumbled on this bug.  I was using packer to generate qemu-based virtual machines, and identical configurations would fail (complaining about invalid keymaps when keystrokes were sent) depending on where the current directory was.  It doesn't work if qemu is run from a directory containing a directory named "common".

Guessing this is related to qemu_find_file, maybe https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/31783203c3b74c11015b20194d57dada559940cf#diff-48a342a3d278d5bdcc69db8f9758dcd6 .

Yes, that's exactly the issue.  If you run qemu in a directory with a file or subdir called 'common' then the keymap won't load.

I can confirm that this issue is still present with:
QEMU emulator version 2.5.0 (Debian 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.6)
Kernel: 4.4.0-53-generic

I am using Packer and the QEMU builder and only the \ key was working in a Windows Guest. I had created folder called "common" to host all the Windows Powershell scripts and this is causing the issue.

I confirm this too: Qemu 2.6.1.

I have tried to install Fedora with kickstart file through Packer with `"boot_command": [ "<tab>text ks=http://{{.HTTPIP}}:{{.HTTPPort}}/ks.cfg<enter>"]`. But no symbol from `["<tab>", " ", "[:alpha:]"]` were printed. Only `["=", ":", "/", "."]` could be seen if I manually press "<tab>".

I think this is likely fixed with QEMU 4.0 by this commit here:

https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=26b1cbf8b65b3b55c3f

Could you please try again with QEMU 4.0-rc4 (or the final 4.0 release next week)?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
