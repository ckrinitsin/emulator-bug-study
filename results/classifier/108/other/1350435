/build/buildd/qemu-2.0.0+dfsg/tcg/tcg.c:1693: tcg fatal error

this seems to be the patch needed
https://patches.linaro.org/32473/

Hi,

have already tested with that patch to verify that it fixes the
issue?  If I put qemu + that patch into a ppa, will your infrastructure
allow you to test that way?

I'm a bit concerned about this patch, as it appears to be one which has
been in the Suse tree for quite some time, begging the question why it is
not upstream.  It would be nice to hear from agraf or pmaydell whether
this patch is safe.


That patch is not in mainline because it's an appalling hack. If we care about multi-threaded guests we need to fix them properly, not paper over the issues by constraining multiple threads to one CPU in the hopes the race conditions don't bite us so often.


No, I did not test the patch, I don't think that I can push that patch in lp infrastructure, and I don't have my own one.

Anyway Peter is right, we don't need to hide bugs, but to fix them ;)

Peter: While this is true, is it actually likely to happen?  I thought in our conversations in the past (when I previously attempted to escalate this class of problems via Linaro) it had been fairly clear that this was a very difficult task that isn't likely to be scheduled for the foreseeable future.

I think it's likely to happen eventually; it depends rather on the balance between this and other work priorities (at least if it's going to be Linaro doing the work). Regardless, I'm not taking hacky workarounds like this into mainline (hacks are hard to get out once you let them in, and they remove any motivation anybody might have had for fixing things properly).


Right, I can absolutely understand that.  The question would I suppose be whether you think this is a completely unreasonable thing to put in a distro patch; I think SUSE are doing so for basically the same reason we would be, that is, a setup such as PPAs where virtualisation isn't available directly on the architecture in question but we can use qemu-user to run foreign-arch binaries reasonably transparently.  My understanding is that this patch would make a pretty huge dent in our failure rate for that setup.

Well, it won't make anything any worse, so it's your call based on how much it actually improves your failure rate I guess.


https://launchpad.net/~serge-hallyn/+archive/ubuntu/qemu-user-thread contains a package with this patch applied (built for trusty).  Please let us know how much it helps.

I got this morning a new FTBFS in a package that have been always built successfully in the past, just FYI
https://launchpadlibrarian.net/181879742/buildlog_ubuntu-trusty-armhf.boinc_7.4.0~nightly1~~git20140809%2Br21874~r184~ubuntu14.04.1_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz

Interesting enough the utopic build was successful!

And when I retried the failed build it succeeded but a segmentation fault (core dumped) is in the logs
https://code.launchpad.net/~costamagnagianfranco/+archive/ubuntu/firefox/+build/6254532
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Are these new failures using the qem upackage in ppa:serge-hallyn/qemu-user-thread, or using the stock trusty qemu package?

How can I use your one? I have no possibility to tweak the host system, I'm not an lp admin, do you think I can try to add your ppa as dependency and it will work?

No, that won't work as it's the emulator in which the build is running.

You should however be able to install the ppa's qemu on a local host,
install a standard ubuntu server vm, apt-get install ubuntu-dev-tools,
copy the package sources over to the vm, and build the packages inside
the vm.


Hi Serge, sorry for the delay,
the problem is that if I run pbuilder-dist utopic armhf create
pbuilder-dist utopic armhf build boinc_whatever.dsc the build never fails also with the trusty qemu, so I cannot test your package with the patch.
(I'm already on trusty, should I really install a server machine?)

Perhaps i don't understand what you are doing.

My understanding was that a package is being built (in the buildds) under qemu.  Qemu is failing due to tcg failure.  We want to tes twhether a qemu patch fixes it.

That's why I suggest installing the new qemu package on your host, using it to run a new server VM, and building the problematic package inside that VM.  That way we can see whether the proposed qemu package fixes the build error.

I didn't install a VM because:
-I'm on ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop
-I use pbuilder-dist (from ubuntu-dev-tools) armhf that uses qemu as underlying virtualization system.

the fact is:
why on my machine it doesn't show this error?

possible solution:
-because qemu+pbuilder-dist is not multithreaded?

This patch is still not applied upstream.

As there has been no discussion in over a year, I assume it is no longer a problem and  I'm going to mark it invalid.  Please rep;ly if that is not the case.

If it *is* still a problem, then we should go discuss on oftc#qemu.

Well.  This is definitely wrong.  It is a valid bug, but it needs quite serious work to fix, which requires major refactoring of the tcg code. Upstream is working on it, see http://wiki.qemu.org/Features/tcg-multithread

Ah, thanks for setting me straight.


We're now building armhf/arm64 packages on real arm64 hardware in Launchpad, so, while this problem may well still exist in qemu, it no longer applies to Launchpad builds.

We think we've fixed our linux-user threading issues, so if there are still problems as of qemu-2.11 or later, please raise a fresh bug report with repro instructions.


per former comments, in context qemu 2.11 is in proposed

      - bump libseccomp-dev dependency, 2.3 is the minimum for ppc64
    - disable missing x32 architecture
    - d/rules: or32 is now named or1k (since 4a09d0bb)
    - d/qemu-system-common.docs: new paths since (ac06724a)
    - d/qemu-system-common.install: qmp-commands.txt removed, but replaced
      by qapi-schema.json which is already packaged (since 4d8bb958)

      supporting ITS (LP 1731051).
    - Apply linux-user-return-EINVAL-from-prctl-PR_-_SECCOMP.patch from
      James Cowgill to prevent qemu-user from forwarding prctl seccomp
      calls (LP 1726394)
