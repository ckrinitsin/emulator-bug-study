TCG doesn't support a lot of features that should be supported

This is quite odd, and I'm not sure about how to get around it. I'm writing an OS in Rust and require APIC support. When I boot my kernel with qemu-system-x86_64, however, it dumps out a [lot] of warnings; it claims that TCG doesn't support FMA, X2APIC, AVX, F16C, AVX2, RDSEED, SHA-NI, FXSR-OPT, misalignsse, 3dnowprefetch, osvw, topoext, perfctr-core, clzero, xsaveerptr, ibpb, nrip-save, xsavec, and xsaves, but prints these warnings over 80 times before finally doing what I told it to do. Running QEMU 5.0.0 (unknown commit hash), as follows:
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=target\x86_64-kernel-none\debug\bootimage-kernel.bin -serial stdio -no-reboot -hdb disk.img -s -m 4G -usb -rtc base=utc,clock=host -cpu EPYC-v3,+acpi,+apic,+rdrand,+rdseed,+sse,+sse2,+sse4.1,+sse4.2,+sse4a,+ssse3,+syscall,+x2apic -smp cpus=8 -soundhw all
I would run using HAXM, but my kernel requires RDRAND, and QEMU does not, to my knowledge, automatically support RDRAND (and I don't know how to enable it).

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days (otherwise it will get
closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate the ticket auto-
matically to the new system.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
