Read certificate from USB key failed

QEMU release version: qemu-2.9.0
VM operation system: win7 32bit

I have an usb key which can be redirected and recognized in VM. However, it is failed to get the certificate when using the official application for this usb key. What's more, the whole app is stalled untill this usb key detached from VM.

As I researched, this usb key uses interrupt transfers when application trying to read certificate from it. Problem is that some certificate data abandoned by "usbredir_stop_interrupt_receiving" and "usbredir_stop_ep". The two functions use "usbredir_free_bufpq" to clear the buffered usb packets, even the certificate remain in the bufpq.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
