qemu-system-ppc hangs when running  -M ppce500 -bios u-boot.e500

On recent qemu versions (tested on locally built versions 2.3.50 and 2.3.93)
the command below causes qemu to hang before the u-boot command prompt is reached.
However in an older version (2.2.1) the u-boot bootprompt is reached and can be typed into,
so apparenly something has broken along the way.


ppc-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc -d guest_errors -d in_asm -M ppce500 -nographic -bios pc-bios/u-boot.e500


From the -d in_asm argument you can compare the runs and the 2.2.1 version
outputs a lot more.

------
- I use the unmodified u-boot.e500 that is inlcuded with each respective version.
- when building qemu my configure paramters were in all three cases :
'./configure' '--target-list=ppc-softmmu,arm-softmmu' '--audio-drv-list=' '--enable-debug'

It is not qemu that hangs. 
The u-boot.e500 software falls into an eternal loop at the addresses 0x00f1f964 to 0x00f1f94c
due to the registers r9 and r10 (both) being 0x0 in the newer versions and 0x40 in the working 2.2.1 version.  

Howerver, those values ought to have originated from the qemu environment somehow.

Looks like this has been broken by this commit here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=e6b4e5f4795b2591fd91bea671e3e22e08fd0e75
("PPC: e500: Move CCSR and MMIO space to upper end of address space")

Problem should now be fixed with this commit:
http://git.qemu-project.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=d4574435a6530bbd96ae130eddfe5b676f91367a
Please test, and close this bug if it is working now.

Yes, It works fine now. Thanks!
I cannot find an option to close this bug, perhaps I'm not authorized to do it?
