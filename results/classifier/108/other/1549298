Add missing MSRs for powertop

I reported this same bug on the powertop bugtracker [1] because I think both projects need to change something here.

When running powertop it crashes and prints:

  unknown op '{'
                read_msr cpu0 0xe8 : Input/output error

It seems that powertop is trying to access model specific registers and because qemu doesn't emulate them it crashes.
Clearly powertop shouldn't crash in such case but I think it would also be better if qemu could add support for these registers.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
