qom-[list,tree,get,set] don't accept tcp endpoint arg

Hi, 

I'm using origin/master [6bbbb0ac13...]. When I run any of the commands in 'qemu/scripts/qmp/qom-[list,tree,get,set]', the help text says that it can connect to a QEMU instance by passing either a path to a unix socket or a tcp endpoint in the format "host:port". The unix socket variant works but the tcp endpoint variant does not. QEMUMonitorProtocol accepts either a string (unix socket) or a tuple (host,port). None of the qom-* scripts actually massage the '-s' argument into a tuple. 

I have a patch to fix this issue that I can submit to the developer list.

Hi! Triaging old bug tickets ... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU? If you've got a patch for this ready, please send it to the qemu-devel mailing list!
