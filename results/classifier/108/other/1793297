windows's paint software cross-shadped cursor offset a pixel in guest windows which is generated by qemu-kvm

I have already tested lots of versions of QEMU. Since qemu-2.3.0 -- qemu-3.0.0. I find weird phenomena about windows's paint software cross-shaped cursor offset a pixel since qemu-2.10.0, but it is ok before the version of qemu-2.10.0. Only spice agent and service are running in guest windows since qemu-2.10.0, windows's paint software cross-shaped cursor offset a pixel is the same as the windows's paint software cross-shaped cursor focus point is the same as the true windows machine instead of virtual windows machine.
What does QEMU change since qemu-2.10.0? It is the changes that result in windows's paint software cross-shaped cursor is not accurate with true windows machine for comparison.  
The following is the full command line used to launch the QEMU guest:
# /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -smp 2 -M pc -name win7-6904 -hda /home/win7_kvmgt.img -bios /usr/bin/bios.bin -enable-kvm -k en-us -vga qxl -display egl-headless -spice disable-ticketing,port=6904,streaming-video=all -machine kernel_irqchip=on,usb=on -global PIIX4_PM.disable_s3=1 -global PIIX4_PM.disable_s4=1 -cpu host -device usb-tablet

BTW, guest windows display card is QXL driver.
But the following full command line used to launch the QEMU guest is OK. For comparison, I pasted it below (Just add vdagent and spicevmc in the command line to make sure spice service and agent is running in the guest windows):
# /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -smp 2 -M pc -name win7-6904 -hda /home/win7_kvmgt.img -bios /usr/bin/bios.bin -enable-kvm -k en-us -vga qxl -display egl-headless -spice disable-ticketing,port=6904,streaming-video=all -machine kernel_irqchip=on,usb=on -global PIIX4_PM.disable_s3=1 -global PIIX4_PM.disable_s4=1 -cpu host -device usb-tablet -device virtio-serial-pci,id=virtio-serial0,max_ports=16,bus=pci.0,addr=0x5 -chardev spicevmc,name=vdagent,id=vdagent -device virtserialport,nr=1,bus=virtio-serial0.0,chardev=vdagent,name=com.redhat.spice.0



The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
