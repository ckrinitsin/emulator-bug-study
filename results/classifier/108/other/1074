File under symlink gets corrupted when directory is mounted as FAT32 drive
Description of problem:
When mouting a directory as a FAT32 drive, the symlinked BOOTx64.EFI inside gets corrupted after booting it.
Steps to reproduce:
1. mkdir -p fat_dir/EFI/BOOT/
2. ln -s BOOTx64.EFI fat_dir/EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI
3. md5sum BOOTx64.EFI
4. Run qemu with arguments like above.
5. md5sum BOOTx64.EFI should print out different hash, confirming corruption.
Additional information:
[BOOTx64.EFI](/uploads/d0a6e899ec9331461179f8dc82fbc421/BOOTx64.EFI)

The issue was not visible on earlier versions, but I don't know which one exactly was it.\
I can only say, it was still working in April and it was possible that I was using Fedora 36 Beta.

Copying the file instead of using a symlink can be used as a workaround.

The binary should print some debug stuff, like avaliable memory regions and end with an infinite halt-loop.
