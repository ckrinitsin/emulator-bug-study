Guest undefined when destroyed on host after migration 

After a live migration, guest VMs are being undefined from the host they were migrated to after shutdown. I have experienced this at two (2) separate locations on more than one hardware configuration.  This happens when utilizing virt-manager to view current allocations on hosts, and virsh on the CLI to migrate guests.  When the guest is migrated from one host to another, no errors are thrown, and only lose 1 packet from infinite ping. Shutting guest down *from* the guest OS results in the Guest VM being undefined on the residing host, and XML config lost.  If needed, I can provide a recorded session of this happening.

Thanks,
  Dan

This is the QEMU bug tracker here ... Can you also reproduce such an issue with plain QEMU? If not, could you please report this to the virt-manager project first? See https://virt-manager.org/bugs/#report for details.

Also, can you please include the libvirt logs for the VM, they're typically in /var/log/libvirt/VMNAME.log

This was done with virsh on the cli - not through virt-manager. Virt 
manager was only used to see the visual residence of the vm. The exact 
command is below:


virsh migrate 79fdd9dd-068b-41cc-b97b-d0f9d8e9df84 --desturi 
qemu+ssh://kvmadmin@192.168.0.84/system

after migrating, shutting down the guest vm results in destruction of vm 
(undefined)


Thanks,

The logs for the VM that gets undefined are no longer available.

Dan:
  Rereading your description I think this might be worth discussing on the libvirt mailing list/bug trackers instead.
  I *think* what you're saying is the migration works fine, the only problem is that after you shutdown the VM it disappears.
  My understanding (although I'm more qemu than libvirt) is that you need to pass --persistent to the virsh migrate   command to get it to stick on the destination.  However, I'd expected that without --persistent it would have still existed on the source after shutdown.

  Given that big long VM name, is it being managed by some higher level thing rather than directly?
