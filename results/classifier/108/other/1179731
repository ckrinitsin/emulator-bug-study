Works for me on qemu.git/master on Linux:

  $ git rev-parse HEAD
  b087143b4d010451208264b7c841436aafe1cbb1
  $ x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 -enable-kvm -cpu host \
          -drive if=virtio,cache=none,file=test.img

Please include more information, like the QEMU command-line and commit
ID.

latest git as of yesterday compiled under mingw using qemu-system-i386 -localtime -m 512 windows.img when ever it connects to the internet qemu hangs.

trying other network adapters does not help either i tried the model=rtl8139 and the xp guest says limited or no connectivty.

tried the patch did not work though still hangs/crashes has issues

Unfortunately I don't have time to investigate these days.

Looking at http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-05/msg02268.html it seems this has been fixed with commits 8db165b36ef893ac69af045 and 3cb8c205e36531a07dff1d84 ==> setting status to "Fix released"
