Build succeeds despite flex/bison missing

I just built qemu using a fresh install, and "make" would report success despite messages of "flex: command not found" and "bison: command not found".

I didn't notice any errors, but I don't know whether that's because there's a workaround in case the tools aren't there, or because I didn't exercize the code paths that would fail.

s/install/git clone/

I think we fixed this at one point in time during the past two years ... can we close this issue now, or could you still reproduce this with the latest version of QEMU?

The warning was supposedly removed by https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/67953a379ea5 / https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg03980.html

Yes, let's mark this as fixed now.
