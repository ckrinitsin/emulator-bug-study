Page sizes are not interpreted correctly for E500/E500MC

According to these documents, variable page size for TLB1 is computed as 4K ** TSIZE.

However, QEMU always treats it as if it was 1K << TSIZE, even if options like "-cpu e500mc" are supplied to qemu.

This is not a bug.  MMU v2 (implemented in e6500) extended the TSIZE field so that 1K <<
TSIZE is correct.  The extension was on the LSB side so that it works
fine as long as the low bit of the new TSIZE (which is reserved on
e500v2/mc) is zero.


You're absolutely right. Sorry for bothering.
