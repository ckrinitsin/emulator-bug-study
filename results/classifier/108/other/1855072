ARM: HCR.TVM traps are not implemented

On AARCH64, setting HCR.TVM to 1 is supposed to trap all writes to CTLR_EL1, TTBR0_EL1, TTBR1_EL1, TCR_EL1, ESR_EL1, FAR_EL1, AFSR0_EL1, AFSR1_EL1, MAIR_EL1, AMAIR_EL1, and CONTEXTIDR_EL1. However, it currently has no effect (QEMU emulator version 4.1.1).

It is also likely that TRVM will not trap, but, I didn't verify this.

Yes to both.

If you could help testing, that would be appreciated.

Thank you for the patch! I am happy to test this for you. I will apply the patch/compile/test and get back to you.

I tested in AArch64 mode and it worked for me. Looking at the patch, we might be missing trapping for "TTBCR"in AA32 though.

Oops.  Thanks for the review.  Posted v2 with ttbcr included.

Thank you! I also tested AArch32 and the code works. Ship it!
