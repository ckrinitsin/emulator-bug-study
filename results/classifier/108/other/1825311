mips_cpu_handle_mmu_fault renders all accessed pages executable

On MIPS, data accesses to pages mapped in the TLB result in mips_cpu_handle_mmu_fault() marking the page unconditionally executable, even if the TLB entry has the XI bit set. Later on, when there is an attempt to execute this page, no exception is generated, even though TLBXI is expected.

I am attaching a reproducer image and script.

Unpatched execution ends like this:

...
TAP TEST START
1..2
not ok 1 NonExecutable::ElfDataIsNotExecutable
# Assertion failed /home/jermar/Kernkonzept/software/l4/pkg/l4re-core/test/moe/test_nx.cc:103

TAP TEST FINISHED



With the proposed patch applied, the execution should end with something like this:

...
TAP TEST START
1..2
ok 1 NonExecutable::ElfDataIsNotExecutable
ok 2 NonExecutable::StackIsNotExecutable
TAP TEST FINISHED


Patch posted on the list:

Also attaching the 64-bit version of the reproducer.

This bug should be fixed by commit 7353113fa482e697a77 now in QEMU master; it will be in the 4.1 release.
