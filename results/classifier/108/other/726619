loadvm does not load (offline) snapshot anymore

qemu Version: 0.14.0
The problem is present in the current code from git master as well.

Loading a snapshot that was created while qemu was not running (using qemu-img) does not seem to work anymore.

Using "loadvm <snapshot-id>" in the qemu monitor does not have the desired effect. Not even an error message is displayed.

I was able to track down the problem (using git bisect) to this commit:
http://git.qemu.org/qemu.git/commit/?id=f0aa7a8b2d518c54430e4382309281b93e51981a

After reverting that commit in my local git checkout everything is workin as expected again.

Triaging old bug tickets ... can you somehow still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU (currently v2.9), or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
