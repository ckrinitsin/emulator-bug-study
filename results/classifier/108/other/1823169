qemu displays message "Setup failed, please check external storage is available and has enough room."

I tried to launch the Android app PokerStarsFR, and after it began initialization, the launch failed with the above error. I'm running qemu on a Dell XPS 13 (9370) laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The standard apps launch OK, but this one does not. I had downloaded it from the PokerStars site https://www.pokerstars.fr/en/poker/download/android/.

I am running qemu version 2.5.0

This is the upstream QEMU bug tracker. Upstream QEMU does not support Android apps. Did you maybe wanted to report a bug to the Android emulator fork instead? Then please report the problem in their bug tracker.
Otherwise, version 2.5.0 is also very old already and not supported anymore (at least from the upstream QEMU project point of view). Please upgrade to the latest version.

Thanks, Thomas. I know that qemu 3.0 is out now, but when I tried to update
qemu on my system, I only got the following:

ruomini@ruomini-XPS-13-9370:~/Downloads$ sudo apt-get install qemu
Reading package lists... Done

qemu is already the newest version (1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36).

If you only want to use the package that is provided with your Linux distribution, you should report bugs to the distribution bug tracker instead, i.e. set Target -> Distribution = Ubuntu, Package = QEMU. Please don't use Project = qemu in that case. Thanks!

I agree to Thomas, and in that case referring to your comment #2 - qemu versions in Ubuntu are associated with the base Ubuntu version - so Ubuntu 16.04 will stick to qemu 2.5 + fixes.
Ubuntu 19.10 released next week has qemu 3.1 btw, see [1]

And vice versa for an upstream report (which is often helpful for deep technical discussions) you'll want to try with the latest version anyway - which for just a few days is 3.1 still, then it will be 4.0 :-)
