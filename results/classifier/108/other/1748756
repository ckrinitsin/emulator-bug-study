[Feature request] Support of TI AM1808 for Lego EV3

It would be great if emulating TI AM1808 would be possible. It will be a big step towards Lego Mindstorms EV3 emulation.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

The QEMU project doesn't implement new target architectures or board models on demand based on wishlist requests; they're a lot of work to do. Instead we simply code-review and incorporate board models and architectures as and when people decide to write them and submit the patches. So there's really no point in having a 'wishlist' bug in the bug tracker saying "support for board X would be nice", because it will never happen, unless by the coincidence that somebody happened to implement and submit it to us anyway.

So I'm going to close this bug as "Won't Fix"; if anybody happens to want to work with upstream on implementing this board model they are welcome to do so -- the mechanism for that is to email qemu-devel (with plans, requests for advice or patches).
