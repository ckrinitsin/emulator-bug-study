OS/2 Warp 4 HPFS corruption

How to reproduce:
Install OS/2 Warp 4 onto HPFS-formatted partition. After reboot there will be messages about "missing" files and OS2.INI not found. Chkdsk C: complains about FS corruption. Nothing changes evwn after fixing errors and next reboot. If you install OS/2 onto FAT partition instead, everything will be OK. I also tried booting images with OS/2 pre-installed through VBOX with same results. Is that HPFS driver or QEMU fault?







The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
