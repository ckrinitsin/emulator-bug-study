[9.0.2] PPC: incorrect name filed in vmstate_tlbemb_entry, broken snapshot replay
Description of problem:
Fix commit: a90db15
When using the Record/replay feature on ppc emulation (qemu-system-ppc binary), an error occurred during loading:
```
qemu-system-ppc: Missing section footer for cpu
qemu-system-ppc: Error -22 while loading VM state
qemu-system-ppc: Could not load snapshot for icount replay
```
I found a typo that led to this error

more info in https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-08/msg02951.html
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run bare metal example from the attachment with the first command-line to create snapshot.
2. Run bare metal example from the attachment with the second command-line to replay snapshot.
