When O2 level is enabled raspi3b board crash randomly when creating abuffer of a differnt size
Description of problem:
Sometimes when running the code creating a framebuffer different from the default size ej:1024x768 qemu hangs and crash with a SIGV, making a weird screen that's painted with the original size and the background of the current window merged onto a large window. This happens when you resize a window without updating it's contents, so qemu is crashing before the first frame after reising the window.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a producedure similar to the one descrived below
2. Run qemu with O2 enabled(debuggind disabled)
3. You may need to run it multiple times to see the bug(like two or three times)
Additional information:
Here is the example procedure implemented on rust, the mailbox interface is test and it's sure that the procedure it's well implemented:
