Breakpoint setting not working on apple Mac host
Description of problem:
1. When use with parameter "-machine virt,accel=hvf -cpu host" to run launch a emulator, it can't set breakpoint and will report error: "warning: failed to set breakpoint site at 0xffff800081bf03cc for breakpoint 1.1: error: 34 sending the breakpoint request"
but if not use with parameter "-machine virt -cpu cortex-a57"ï¼ŒThe breakpoint can be set successfully.

2. Set hardware breakpoint with lldb command "breakpoint set -H -a 0xFFFF800080000000" not report error, but can't hint breakpoint. I try set breakpoint on a old x86 MacOS, It will hint breakpoint successfully.

3. I also try run qemu-system-x86_64 emulator on apple silicon mac, It also can't hint hardware breakping. The command is:
```
qemu-system-x86_64 -machine q35,accel=tcg -smp cpus=8  \
  -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage \
  -append "okaslr"\
  -nographic -serial mon:stdio \
  -m 16G \
  -s -S
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch qemu on Apple silicon Mac. Remember to user "hvf" 
2. Launch lldb or gdb to set breakpoint.
3. Set breakpoint and hardware breakpoint.
4. resume to run qemu by lldb.
