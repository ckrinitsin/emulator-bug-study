upon pressing F2 failures in loading the edk2 bios interface app
Description of problem:
Cosmetic, low priority, but maybe easy to fix  
Occasional failures to load the edk2 bios interface app  
Workaround, retry until success
Steps to reproduce:
1. start qemu
2. press F2 when qemu guest display window pops up. When it works, it brings up the edk2 bios interface. 
   This bug concerns the case when it does not work

For reasons not clear, sometimes, after pressing F2, and after qemu registered the key-stroke (F2) and responded by changing the window size, the bios interface loading process seems to abruptly stop at the following guest-display-screen with the following message.  
```BdsDxe: Loading Boot0000 "UiApp" From Fv(7CB8BDC9-F8EB-F434-AAEA-3EE4AF6516A1)/FvFile(462CAA21-7614-4503-836E-8AB6F4662311)```

When the bios interface loading process does succeed, it goes to the expected screen:

Additional information:
Unsure if this sort of bug should go upstream to https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/issues   
Herein notifying @kraxel 

Not a measured statistic, but on basis of feeling, I'd qualitatively say 4 out of 5 times it fails to bring up the bios interface. Its a bit frustrating because it feels like one has no control over it and a successful event is left to chance.  

This isn't a recent introduction/regression. I've noticed this since 8.0.0, so its been this way maybe longer.
