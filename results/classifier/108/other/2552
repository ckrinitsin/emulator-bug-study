system libfdt said to be too old (1.5.1 min required) but 1.7.1 is installed.
Description of problem:
<--
I am running an update build of the latest qemu version 9.0.2 to update it from 8.1.2 in the IPFire firewall distribution.
The build command being run was

`
./configure \
	--prefix=/usr \
	--sysconfdir=/etc \
	--localstatedir=/var \
	--enable-kvm \
	--disable-attr \
	--target-list="$(TARGETS)" \
	--extra-cflags="$(CFLAGS)" \
	--enable-spice \
	--enable-usb-redir \
	--enable-seccomp \
	--disable-docs \
	--disable-sdl \
	--enable-slirp 
`

and where $TARGETS is

`	x86_64-linux-user \
	aarch64-linux-user \
	riscv64-linux-user \
	x86_64-softmmu \
	aarch64-softmmu \
	riscv64-softmmu
`

and $CFLAGS is

`	"-O2"
	"-g0"
	"-pipe"
	"-Wall"
	"-fexceptions"
	"-fPIC"
	"-Wp,-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE"
	"-Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3"
	"-Wp,-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS"
	"-fstack-protector-strong"
	"-fstack-clash-protection"
` 

This built qemu successfully with version 8.1.2 and earlier versions.

From version 9.0.1 onwards the subproject dtc has been removed from the Source Tarball and the build came back with the error message

Library fdt found: NO

../meson.build:3190:18: ERROR: Git command failed: ['/usr/bin/git', 'fetch', '--depth', '1', 'origin', 'b6910bec11614980a21e46fbccc35934b671bd81']

The git command failed as the distribution build is done with no network connection. All packages have to be available in the build and so the package cannot be downloaded during the build.

Therefore I moved the dtc package in the IPFire build to before building qemu and added --disable-download to the ./configure options.

The error message changed to

Library fdt found: YES

../meson.build:3182:7: ERROR: Problem encountered: system libfdt requested, but it is too old (1.5.1 or newer required)

However the dtc libfdt version is 1.7.1 - definitely newer than 1.5.1

Why is the version being seen as too old?
How do I get this to detect the dtc libfdt version correctly (it has detected that libfdt is present in the IPFire build environment).
