Xen 4.4 with qemu 1.6.2 VGA passthru NVIDIA

Hi!

Please, give me an advice.

I try use VGA passthough NVidia k40 on SuperMicro Server, but server is having error.
My Xen is using qemu (a9e8aeb3755bccb7b51174adcf4a3fc427e0d147)2.0.0

My VirtualMachine is have config:
device_model_version = "qemu-xen"
device_model_override = "/opt/sources/qemu-a9e8aeb/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64"

When I start VM:
dmesg
[    0.906181] pci 0000:00:05.0: BAR 1: can't assign mem pref (size 0x100000000)
[    0.906187] pci 0000:00:05.0: BAR 1: trying firmware assignment [mem 0x100000000-0x1ffffffff 64bit pref]
[    0.906193] pci 0000:00:05.0: BAR 1: assigned [mem 0x100000000-0x1ffffffff 64bit pref]
and lspci -s 00:05.0 -vvv
        Region 0: Memory at 85000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]
        Region 1: Memory at 100000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=4G]
        Region 3: Memory at 82000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=32M]

Why?

This is message in DOM0:
lspci -s 03:00.0 -vvv
....
Region 0: Memory at de000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]
Region 1: Memory at 5800000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=16G]
Region 3: Memory at 5c00000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=32M]


Why Qemu don`t mapping BAR1?
Thanks!
Regards!



Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU? If so, have you already tried to report it to the folks from the Xen project?

Hi!

Sorry, I solved this problem. I used another project(qemu-kvm). I don't have a hardware for this.

:(
