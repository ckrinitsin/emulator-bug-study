Storage | Two decimal digits precision

Tested on: Fedora 34; Component: qemu-img-5.2.0-5.fc34.1.x86_64

Hello. A two decimal digits precision is most appropriated on systems whose storage capacities have to be saved. That is one of the reason why such precision is supported in the context of creation of virtual machines in several Unix/Linux virtualization platforms; virt-manager is one of them. That last exhibits virtual disks size values with such precision – 128.00 GiB – nevertheless it lacks yet a mention illustrating physical disks size values. 

Storage values exhibited in qemu-img and virt-manager are already according to a clear format; thus, values are not attached to their measure units (#value# #units#).

$ qemu-img info ~/.local/share/libvirt/images/fedora_default.img | sed -n '2,4p'
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 128 GiB (137438953472 bytes)
disk size: 147 MiB

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
