Tight PNG VNC encoding is sent even when --disable-vnc-png is set

This bug exists in 0.14.1 and also in 9312805d33e8b (Jun 17, 2011) in the master git repo.

The "Tight PNG" encoding is a derivative of the "Tight" encoding that replaces zlib encoded rects with PNG encoded data instead. However, when the "Tight PNG" encoding is disabled (--disable-vnc-png), the server will send frame buffer updates that are marked as "Tight PNG" but in fact contain zlib encoded regions (i.e. it's really "tight" protocol).

The "Tight PNG" encoding should only be used when --enable-vnc-png is set.



The patch looks right, maybe you should send it directly to the qemu mailing list.

Using noVNC and kvm in SLES 11 we have hit this bug as well. 

Joel, would you like to send your patch to the qemu mailing list?

I sent the patch on May 16 (http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2012-05/msg02373.html). I haven't seen any response.

Patch had been included here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=fe3e7f2dc05225cdd2ba
... so I'm closing this ticket now.
