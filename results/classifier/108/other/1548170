qemu-kvm-spice spice server locks up when large user image is set

QEMU emulator version 2.0.0 (Debian 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.22), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

I have QEMU kvm spice installed, running a Windows 10 1511, freshly installed this morning, using VirtIO root volume, Ethernet, and QXL graphics through Spice. It successfully installed the latest updates, and installed Visual Studio 2010 Professional plus Service Pack 1 and updates.

Upon attempting to configure the following PNG as my account's user picture in the Settings control panel applet:

It added successfully, but then I noticed that Windows does not support alpha blended user pictures, and it blended it against white, so I quickly replaced it with the following:

https://static.kode54.net/pwywcomm_christopher_blended.png

Upon assigning that, with the other one still in the previous image buttons, Spice locked up completely. The VM was still running, as evidenced by a successful Remote Desktop session.

Do I need to replace my entire Qemu setup with a Git or hand built official version to verify that this isn't Ubuntu's fault?

I know next to nothing about graphic in QEMU but yes, it's worth to check the
lastest release (2.5) or even better the current git master.

This does not appear to happen with 2.5, which I finally got installed through a full distribution upgrade to the latest beta of the upcoming LTS release. Of course, now I have another issue I didn’t notice before, where the Windows VM, which idles at about 20% of a single core most of the time, ends up using 80-100% of a single core on the host machine in the qemu-system-x86_64 process, but that’s probably what it was already doing before.

If I get comment #2 right, the spice issue has been fixed sometime between v2.0 and v2.5, so I'm closing this ticket now. If you still encounter this issue with the latest version of QEMU (currently v4.0), feel free to open again (or report a new bug ticket for other issues).
