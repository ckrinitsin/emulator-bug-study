Windows 7 fails with blue screen when KVM is enabled.
Description of problem:
The problem appeared immediately after a full system update of Arch Linux (The first for several months). Windows 7 images that had been running normally would fail with a blue screen and Error 0x7E immediately after displaying "Starting Windows". The same error would occur with a Windows 7 installation image, as in the command line above. When the "-enable-kvm" option was removed Windows would run normally but slowly. An old Clonezilla image booted without apparent problems.

The final line on the blue screen reads:
*** STOP: 0x0000007E (0xC0000005,0x8BA3CA36,0x85186AA0,0x85186680)

After getting the problem with the Arch package I cloned the source and built the latest version, getting the same error. However, when I build version 5.2.95 (v6.0.0-rc5-dirty) I found that this would run my existing Windows images (qcow2) and the installation ISO image.
