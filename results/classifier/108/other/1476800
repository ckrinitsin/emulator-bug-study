Instant runtime error (Host: Windows 8.1 VM: WinXP ISO)

I have Qemu Manager on my Windows 8.1 laptop and have a WXP iso and a blank disk image (from here http://www.mediafire.com/download/rtec86bwwmee00s/Blank_Disk.zip ) and as soon as I try to open it I get a Runtime Error ( http://i.gyazo.com/bfebf7e1e7a670f8e52cc95c5923a67e.png )

Looking through old bug tickets... which version of QEMU did you use here? Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
