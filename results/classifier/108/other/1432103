error in x86 executable segment permission check

When the code segment register (%cs) selects an executable segment with no read permission, mov instructions that read from the segment via %cs prefix can still succeed without causing a general protection error.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays? Can you provide a binary to reproduce this issue?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
