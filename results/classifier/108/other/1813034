create_elf_tables() doesn't set AT_PLATFORM for 32bit ARM  platforms

The dynamic linker uses AT_PLATFORM from getauxval to substitute $PLATFORM in certain places (man ld.so). It would be nice if it was set to 'v6l', 'v7l' and whatever other platforms there are according to the chosen CPU or via an environment variable. AT_PLATFORM is not guaranteed to be set, so this isn't a major bug, but this is one case where it makes things difficult.

I've tried the patch and it solves the problem for my use case.
