qemu-6.1.0 causes I/O errors in VMs leading to data corruption
Description of problem:
after upgrading around 10 gentoo hosts from qemu-6.0.0-r53 to 6.1.0 most VMs (around 85 of 100, our VMs with PostgreSQL have 100% chance of hitting this) after some time (few minutes) will have I/O Errors, causing crashes and data corruption.
The VMs are stored on ZFS volumes.
Downgrading to qemu-6.0.0-r53 instantly fixes this.
Happens on completely different hardware (quad core Xeons to 32C Epyc2).

Reproducible: Always
