qemu-aarch64 $program  > $file doesn't pipe output to file in 2.12.0

Running qemu-aarch64 $program > $file doesn't pipe anything to $file. The file is created but empty.

qemu-aarch64 --help > $file works, so piping output in my system seems to work.
qemu-x86_64 $program > $file works, too.

I'm running version 2.12.0 build from source with ./configure && make

Output of uname -a:
Linux zhostname>  4.4.0-101-generic #124-Ubuntu SMP Fri Nov 10 18:29:59 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Running "unbuffer qemu-aarch64 $program > $file" allows to pipe the output.

Is it intentional that I need to disable buffering to allow piping to other processes? If yes, this issue can be closed.

No, this should work on qemu-aarch64 the same way as for x86. I just tried redirection to a file with a sample program, and it worked fine for me. Can you provide a test case binary that fails like this, please?


This issue is now marked as invalid, sorry for the trouble.

qemu works just fine. The problem was with my linker configuration, it was using a different dynamic library for aarch64. Switching to a standard development stack solved my problem.
