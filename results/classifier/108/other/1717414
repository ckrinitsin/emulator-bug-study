Sending certain keysyms results in wrong symbol input

I develop bVNC, an Android VNC client. I noticed that when I connect to qemu VMs that have a VNC console, Keysyms that are usually sent over with SHIFT modifier when connecting from a PC have wrong symbols typed within the VM. A very short list of examples: 

exclam                              33     0x0021

results in "1" typed in the VM.

at                                  64     0x0040

results in "2"

plus                                43     0x002b

results in "="

asterisk                            42     0x002a

results in "8"

On Android, KEYCODEs that correspond to the above keysyms do not come with SHIFT metastate. Therefore, the keysyms that they correspond to are not sent over with any modifiers and must just work.

The issue was reproduced with bVNC and RealVNC viewers connecting to many versions of qemu (Ubuntu 14.04, oVirt 3.4, oVirt 4.1, etc.). The qemu version that comes with oVirt 4.1 is 2.6.0, commit hash bfc766d38e1fae5767d43845c15c79ac8fa6d6af.

Sincerely,

There have been quite a bunch of improvements in the keysyms handling during the past years ... can you still reproduce your issue with the latest version of QEMU?

Seems to work fine now. Thank you!!

Thanks for testing! So I'm closing the ticket now.
