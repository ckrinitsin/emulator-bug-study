-cpu haswell / broadwell have no MONITOR in features1

In qemu 2.9.0 if you run

    qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu Broadwell (or Haswell)

then the CPU features1 flag include the SSE3 bit, but do NOT include the MONITOR/MWAIT bit.  This is so even when the host includes the features.


Additionally, running qemu in this manner results in several error messages:

warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.01H:ECX.fma [bit 12]

warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.3dnowprefetch


(Among possible other uses, the lack of the MONITOR feature bit causes NetBSD to fall-back on a
check-and-pause loop while an application CPU is waiting to be told to proceed by the boot CPU.)

Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Looking at https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=0723cc8a5558c94388 for example, it might have been fixed since QEMU v4.2...

This bug seems not to be a problem, and may reflect an issue with
NetBSD.  Even though the decode of the features1 register does not
include MONITOR/MWAIT, that capability is separately reported on a
separate line, further down (apologies in advance for any confusing
line-wrap):
