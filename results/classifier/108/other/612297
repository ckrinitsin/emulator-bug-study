qemu-kvm fails to detect mouse while Windows 95 setup

CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 945
KVM-Version: qemu-kvm-0.12.4+dfsg (Debian package)
Kernel: linux-2.6.26.8-rt16
arch: x86_64
Guest: Windows 95 B

I'm trying to install Windows 95 B on qemu-kvm with this options:

kvm /var/mmn/vm/Win95/Win95.img -name "Windows 95" -M pc-0.12 -m 512M -rtc base=localtime -k de -soundhw sb16 -vga cirrus -net user,hostname=w95vm -net nic,model=ne2k_pci -boot a -fda /var/mmn/vm/floppy/win95B_Drive-D-boot.img -cdrom /var/mmn/vm/CD/win95-setup.iso -no-acpi -no-kvm -usb

I've also tried some other option, but always the same: no ps/2 mouse detection. And usb mouse is not supported by Windows 95 B while setup process. This is only possible later by installing the extension usbsupp.exe after the system setup.

Seems like you were using the QEMU from your Linux distribution. If you want to have support for that version, you should use the bug tracker from your distro instead. Otherwise, can you please try again with the latest version from http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Download to see whether the bug is already fixed there? Thanks!
