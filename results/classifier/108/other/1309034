A way not to grab keyboards or mice

I set up the window manager to move windows with Alt-Btn1, and to
iconify windows with Shift-Btn1. But since qemu grabs keyboards and
mice, I can't move or iconify the qemu window.

I tried not to grab anything, by inserting return, just beginnig of
ui/sdl.c:sdl_grab_start() as follows:

static void sdl_grab_start(void)
{
    return;
    /*

It is comfortable. I'm glad if you make a way not to grab.
Environment variables, options, etc are welcome.

Current command line is:
QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=pa /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -hda /dosc/win8_x64.img -soundhw hda -boot c -m 2G -cpu Nehalem,+sep -usb -usbdevice tablet -display sdl -rtc base=localtime

qemu version is:
luna:linux % qemu-system-x86_64 --version
QEMU emulator version 1.7.93, Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard
luna:linux % 

Host: slackware64 14.1

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
