kernel NULL pointer in -virtual (-server) kernel

We launched 18 instances, 2 of them failed this way.  The instances run with 192M of memory.  With 6 VM launches on a single node all at the same time the host is under heavy load.

This occurred in 20100323 lucid x86_64 uec-image instance.

I saw this https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=560114 which links to http://<email address hidden>/msg08927.html


just for the record, ubuntu-bug was run on a different instance (same kernel/filesystem, but not the one that failed)

Hi Scott,

This bug was reported a while ago and there hasn't been any activity in it recently. We were wondering if this is still an issue? Can you try with the latest development release of Ubuntu?  ISO CD images are available from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/ .
        
If it remains an issue, could you run the following command from a Terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal).  It will automatically gather and attach updated debug information to this report.
        
apport-collect -p linux 546458
        
Also, if you could test the latest upstream kernel available that would be great.  It will allow additional upstream developers to examine the issue.  Refer to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelMainlineBuilds .  Once you've tested the upstream kernel, please remove the 'needs-upstream-testing' tag.  This can be done by clicking on the yellow pencil icon next to the tag located at the bottom of the bug description and deleting the 'needs-upstream-testing' text.  Please let us know your results.
        
Thanks in advance.
        
    [This is an automated message.  Apologies if it has reached you inappropriately; please just reply to this message indicating so.]
    

This is still a concern, and not easily reproducible. I would rather keep it open, unless you have reason to consider the OOPS resolved on current 2.6.32-21. I am stress-testing (by extension) kvm, and hopefully either I can state it has not happened on the last (few) thousands tries, and recornfirm it.

then let's set the linux task to Triaged. i only like to use 'new' for actual new bugs. :-)

~JFo

I see no indication that this is actually a qemu issue.  If there's any evidence that it is, please reopen.

Just to confirm -- still present, 10.04 LTS up-to-date, UEC images also 10.04 up-to-date. A 2,000 run creating KVM instances under Eucalyptus shows 6 occurences of this OOPS:

Per comment #7, marking this invalid for qemu-kvm.

Description of problem:

During an VNC installation on a virt guest, the installer appeared to hang while installing the bootloader.  Closer inspection on the console shows a kernel NULL pointer dereference.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

 * anaconda-13.23
 * kernel-2.6.33-0.23.rc5.git1.fc13.x86_64

How reproducible:
 * This is the first time out of 8 or more installs

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Perform an installation against http://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/stage/rawhide-testing/
  
Actual results:

Running anaconda 13.23, the Fedora system installer - please wait.             
21:09:16 Starting VNC...
21:09:17 The VNC server is now running.

21:09:17 Please manually connect your vnc client to test1200.test.redhat.com:1 (10.10.10.200) to begin the install.

This seems to be the same kvm scsi emulation issue reported and discussed on the LKML,
   http://<email address hidden>/msg08927.html

and also Debian bug #511914

Rgds, Ariel

Which qemu-kvm version are you using? Could you try the one from virt-preview?

qemu's SCSI support isn't the one that gets most developer attention; can you please try ide or virtio?

(In reply to comment #2)
> Which qemu-kvm version are you using? Could you try the one from virt-preview?

 * qemu-kvm-0.11.0-12.fc12.x86_64

I'm running into other issues when trying to use the F-12 virt-preview repository.  I'll take those to <email address hidden> for feedback.

I can work around this by using ide or virtio.  This is certainly specific to SCSI KVM installs.

I'm still not able to start a guest using virt-preview repository.  I've filed bug#566425 to address that issue.

This bug appears to have been reported against 'rawhide' during the Fedora 13 development cycle.
Changing version to '13'.

More information and reason for this action is here:
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping

The issue which blocks use of virt-preview/F-13 qemu has been resolved.  Would it be possible to retest with qemu-0.12.x on the host?


This message is a reminder that Fedora 13 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 30 (thirty) days from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 13.  It is Fedora's policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained.  At that time
this bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora 
'version' of '13'.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' 
to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 13's end of life.

Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that 
we may not be able to fix it before Fedora 13 is end of life.  If you 
would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it 
against a later version of Fedora please change the 'version' of this 
bug to the applicable version.  If you are unable to change the version, 
please add a comment here and someone will do it for you.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.  Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.

The process we are following is described here: 
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping


Fedora 13 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2011-06-25. Fedora 13 is 
no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further 
security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.

If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of 
Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version.

Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.

Closing this bug with Won't fix as this kernel / release is no longer supported.
Please feel free to open a new bug report if you're still experiencing this on a newer release (Bionic 18.04.3 / Disco 19.04)
Thanks!
