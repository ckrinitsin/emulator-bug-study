qemu-git gravis ultrasound not working

Qemu git 2.1.50 with dos622 and windows 3.11.

Parameter:

For build: default-configs/sound.mak CONFIG_GUS=y

Starting parameter: qemu-system-i386 -cpu 486 -m 32M -vga cirrus -hda disk1.img -soundhw gus,pcspk -parallel none -net nic,model=ne2k_isa -net user

The installer of GUS driver 4.11 does not recognize the card. And  conscan tells me that ioport 220-240 and not safe for synth base. It seems that there is a port conflict.



Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

The problem seems to exist for a long time. I have tried it today with both:
qemu-system-i386 ./msdos.disk -device gus,irq=5 -parallel none
and
qemu-system-x86_64 ./msdos.disk -device gus,irq=5 -parallel none

with and without providing the irq parameter and gus does not install with conscan showing:
file:///tmp/gnome-shell-screenshot-5N7FP0.png

The conscan screenshot for my previous post ...


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
