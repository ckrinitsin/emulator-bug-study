Maintain Haiku support

It was pointed out that the 2.10 release notes are pushing to drop Haiku support.  The qemu port is currently working as-is under Haiku.

Was there a reason this was recommended? Is there anything Haiku can do to keep it from being dropped?

We're working on a docker container to cross-compile rust-lang for Haiku, could this be of some use to qemu when complete?

Basically we don't want to try to support host systems where we
have no access to hardware that will let us compile and run
the test suite, and where there's nobody interacting with us
upstream to help fix issues that are Haiku related.

If there's genuinely a community of Haiku QEMU users out there
who want to help us maintain the support in the QEMU codebase that's
great. What we don't want is to be carrying around code we can't
test and where we don't seem to have anybody using it. (For instance
we're about to drop support for AIX...)

Cross-compilation won't let us run the test suite.

Haiku recently got a virtio driver, so running a Haiku system in cloud infrastructure seems possible now. (I've personally run it on vultr.com) Does QEMU have some infrastructure available so we can stand up a x86_64 system?

Nope. We would be looking either for ssh login on a system somebody
else admins, or detailed instructions on how to set up a VM for it,
like the ones we have for BSD at https://wiki.qemu.org/index.php/Hosts/BSD

Contacting our board of directors to see if I can get a VM deployed at Vultr. I'll keep this ticket updated.

We're purchasing some new hardware, once we get it set up we'll setup a x86_64 Haiku machine to build qemu.

Is there any update on this? Could you provide a machine with ssh login to the QEMU project where QEMU could be built and tested on Haiku? Or can Haiku be installed automatically without graphical UI interactions? In that case, would it be feasible that you provide a VM setup for our tests/vm/ files in QEMU?

Hi!

Sorry, I forgot about this one.

Haiku has a lot of options.. we can setup a vm image if needed to move this along.
Haiku is graphical, but has ssh and all the standard tools.

Vagrant also supports Haiku and provides some automation around it.
https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=downloads&provider=&q=haiku-os

Let me check out tests/vm/ to see if I can PR something.

ok..  a Haiku vm for QEMU is WIP here:

It looks like we have a few out-of-tree patches to fix that:

https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports/blob/master/app-emulation/qemu/patches/qemu-2.11.1.patchset

A patch for this work has been posted to the qemu-dev ML.
