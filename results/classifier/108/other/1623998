pulseaudio Invalid argument error

When using qemu-system-ppc on Ubuntu Mate 15 with the usb audio card, I see these error messages:

pulseaudio: set_sink_input_volume() failed
pulseaudio: Reason: Invalid argument
pulseaudio: set_sink_input_mute() failed
pulseaudio: Reason: Invalid argument

No audio plays. When an attempt is made, QEMU seems to freeze for a moment. 

I use "-device usb-audio" to add the usb sound card. This issue is present in both emulation and KVM mode.

Triaging old bug tickets ... Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU (currently 4.1)? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

I tried using "-device usb-audio"and the guest was able to detect the USB audio card, but for some reason no audio would play. I did not see any messages in the terminal about pulseaudio.

What output do you get when you run "qemu-system-x86_64 -audio-help" ? Could you provide your full command line, please?

Here is the output. I assumed you meant qemu-system-ppc.

$ ./ppc-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc -audio-help
Environment variable based configuration deprecated.
Please use the new -audiodev option.

Equivalent -audiodev to your current environment variables:
(Since you didn't specify QEMU_AUDIO_DRV, I'll list all possibilities)
-audiodev id=oss,driver=oss
-audiodev id=none,driver=none

Looks like your current QEMU now only contains the audio backend for OSS, but not for pulseaudio anymore. Please make sure that the right pulse-audio development package (e.g. "pulseaudio-libs-devel") is installed before running the "configure" script of QEMU.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
