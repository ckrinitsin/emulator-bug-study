qemu-img can not convert virtualbox virtual disk formats qcow

Hello, I'm working with QEMU on macOS, and am experiencing issues working with the `qemu-img` command.

I've attached a zip file containing the vbox created qcow image along with the image that `qemu-img` converted.



Hi,

What exactly is the issue?  All of that looks rather OK to me.

This bug was related to an IRC discussion on Jan 14th but this bug description is not showing the problem that was raised on IRC. The IRC discussion showed a source image with a 9GB Windows 10 installation, turning into an image with only 8 MB of data present.  The images in this bug description don't have any data written so are not illustrating the data conversion issue.


The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
