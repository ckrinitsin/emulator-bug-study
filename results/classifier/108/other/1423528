 setting unsupported timeout for i6300esb watchdog causes hw reset

Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=778291
Version: 2.1

systemd utilizes existing watchdog hardware and set's a 10min timer on reboot.
The i6300esb under qemu doesn't like such a timeout, and immediately resets the hardware:

The last message one gets is
[    9.402243] i6300esb: Unexpected close, not stopping watchdog!


The linked bug report contains information how this bug can easily be reproduced.
With any image using a recent enough systemd as PID 1 you should be able to reproduce it by running

qemu-system-x86_64 -curses -enable-kvm -device i6300esb -watchdog-action reset -hda <image with systemd>


I'm uncertain if this is a qemu or kernel/driver bug. If the latter, please re-assign the bug as necessary.

Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?


There's nothing changed in i6300esb about this issue. I can reproduce it exactly the same way with current qemu 5.1-tobe


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
