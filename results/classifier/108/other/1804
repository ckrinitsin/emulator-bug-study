Virtual Machines Do Not Recognize Mouse 5 and 6
Description of problem:
Trying to click the mouse buttons 5 and 6 to go forwards and backwards in Firefox does not work. It seems that those buttons are not recognized by the virtual machine. Tested with both `libvirt` and `aqemu`. Though `libvirt` testing was done on a Fedora host a few months prior.

Running Fedora 38 VM in virtualbox does not have this problem, the guest recognizes button 5 and 6, going forwards and backwards in Firefox.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install aqemu or libvirt on Debian 12
2. Create a Fedora 38 Guest machine
3. Open Firefox and navigate to a few pages, then try to go backwards and forwards in history using the mouse buttons.
