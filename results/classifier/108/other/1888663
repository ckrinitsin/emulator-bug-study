msmouse not recognized in guest

The msmouse option for emulating a serial mouse does not seem to work in a DOS guest. 

I'm on Windows 10 X64, I have tried launching qemu (commit d0cc248164961a7ba9d43806feffd76f9f6d7f41 but also way older) with:
./qemu-system-i386 -serial msmouse -fda mousetest.img
./qemu-system-i386 -chardev msmouse,id=msmouse -device isa-serial,chardev=msmouse -fda mousetest.img
./qemu-system-i386 -chardev msmouse,id=msmouse -device pci-serial,chardev=msmouse -chardev msmouse,id=msmouse -fda mousetest.img

Then I boot FreeDOS (but regular DOS shows same behavior), start the CuteMouse driver and force the scan of a serial mouse with CTM /S.
The mouse is never found. With other drivers (in the attachment), the mouse is probably not found but the driver is installed anyway, but it does not work (there's a MOUSETST in the same floppy; it works iwth CTM and PS/2 mouse emulation).

Using a serial port sniffer inside the guest, it would seem that data is indeed transmitted. Setting a few printf in msmouse.c also confirms that the mouse gets initilized and starts transmitting data. However, it does not work...




This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
