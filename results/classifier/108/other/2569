The alpha target doesn't support tcg plugin register tracking due to missing XML
Description of problem:
There is no register tracking because we build our register list based on XML and there was no XML for alpha because its so old. We could synthesise one to cover the register to fix this.
Steps to reproduce:
1. ./qemu-alpha -d plugin -plugin ./contrib/plugins/libexeclog.so,reg=\* ./tests/tcg/alpha-linux-user/hello-alpha
