error while building from source on Ubuntu 16.04

I'm trying to build Qemu from source (from git) as specified here: http://www.qemu-project.org/download/#source

Here is the git commit hash for the source: 7d2c6c95511e42dffe2b263275e09957723d0ff4

During the 'make' step, I get the following error:

migration/rdma.c: In function ‘qemu_rdma_dump_id’:
migration/rdma.c:749:21: error: ‘struct ibv_port_attr’ has no member named ‘link_layer’

I searched around a bit, my problem seems related to this: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/992952/

That issue makes me think my libibverbs may be out of date, but I checked and I have libibverbs-dev installed.  Is that the correct version?

FYI, I installed libibverbs-dev as suggested here: http://wiki.qemu-project.org/index.php/Hosts/Linux#Recommended_additional_packages

Since libibverbs was optional, I uninstalled it.  After doing so, my build seems to have progressed past this error.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
