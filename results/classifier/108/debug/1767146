No ACPI-table found, option -M 1.6 not found either

Currently writing a small kernel, when trying to detect memory blocks that contain ACPI information, no such block is found. When ran in Oracle Virtualbox, code runs flawlessly.

Code that is detecting the ACPI-Info (with a bit of debug-output):

```
multiboot_memory_map32_t* map = (multiboot_memory_map32_t*)mmap;
for (uint32_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
	Termutils::cout << map[i].type << "type of block  ";
        if (mmap[i].type == MULTIBOOT_MEMORY_ACPI_RECLAIMABLE) {
		Termutils::cout << "WE ARE INSIDE\n";
		fadt = (FADT*)(map[i].base_addr_low);
		//break;
	}
	if (i % 9 == 0) {
		Termutils::cout << "\n";
	}
}
```

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
