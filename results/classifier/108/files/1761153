qemu-user incorrect mmap for large files on 64bits host and 32bits executable.

qemu-user seems to incorrectly mmap a file if the offset is > 4GiB and guest binary is 32 bits elf.

See attached test program `test_mmap.c`.

```
$ gcc -g -m32 -march=i386 test_mmap.c -o test_mmap
$ file test_mmap
test_mmap: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=e36db05f4dfd8a9cfde8a969214a242c1f5a4b49, with debug_info, not stripped
$ uname -a

$ qemu-i386 test_mmap
Incorrect data 1
```

Tested with qemu-i386 packaged in Fedora 27 and qemu-i386 compiled from git master (094b62cd9c)

The issue was firstly detected on (more complex program) using qemu-arm (with 32bits binary) so it is probably a 32/64bits problem independently of the cpu family.



The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
