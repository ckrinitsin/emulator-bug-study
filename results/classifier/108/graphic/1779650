The display stays black after waking up a domain via SPICE with a QXL card

As the title says, in a jessie VM, waking up a VM via the spice remote view works with a VGA graphic card. With a QXL card though, the domain wakes up but the display stays black (the keyboard is working though).

Does the problem still persist with the latest version of QEMU? Did you maybe try to report it to the Spice project (https://www.spice-space.org/support.html)?
