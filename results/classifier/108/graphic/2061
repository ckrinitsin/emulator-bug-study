Regression: QEMU 8.2.0 VFIO GPU guests cannot reboot due to improper reset
Description of problem:
Prior to QEMU 8.2.0 (i.e. 8.1.4), rebooting the guest with VFIO GPU passed through would result in a proper reboot.
After updating to QEMU 8.2.0, rebooting the guest results in a black screen due to improper reset behaviour.
I was able to narrow this down to commit #3d779ab. Compiling and running with commit #0bddd88 results in the correct behaviour.
That is, the GPU properly resets on guest reboot and boots successfully to Windows.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Update to QEMU 8.2.0
2. Boot Windows 11 23H2
3. Reboot
4. Notice a black screen
