migrate exec ignores exit status

Binary package hint: kvm

Using

  migrate "exec:cat > foo; false"

in the monitor results in the state of the VM being written to foo, as expected, and the VM then being stopped. This is surprising, as I think it stands to reason that in case of a failed migrate-exec process, which is what a non-zero exit status implies to me, the VM should continue.

Well, I have reproduced this behavior in Lucid's qemu-kvm 0.12.3, so the report is still accurate.

I don't have a strong opinion on the desired behavior, though I can certainly see the bug reporter's point.

This bug is filed against the upstream QEMU project, so we'll defer to Upstream's decision on this feature.  Thanks for the report.

This is a bug and has been reported upstream, it is unlikely to be fixed at the distribution level and therefore anyone interested in working on this bug should contribute a patch to the upstream project.  This will then filter down to Ubuntu when it is merged mainline.  Marking "Won't Fix" against the Ubuntu package.

Thanks for reporting this bug.

The attached patch works for me with the posted test case.

Patch has been included here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=41ef56e61153d7bd27d34a63463
So I assume this should be working now.
