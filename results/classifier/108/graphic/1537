One-floppy windows 3.11  file manager does not work in tcg mode
Description of problem:
When I try to boot mini win 3.11 from https://archive.org/details/mwin-3 it boots into desktop ok, but double-clicking on file manager icon  result in black window/GPF (briefly flashing text I can't fully read).

Starting it with boot choice 2 - with emm386 - same action result in machine reboot.

Using same disk with kvm works for choice #2 (boot with emm386)
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download IMG file from Arhivce org
2. Run it like I shown above
3. Any (out of two) boot choices lead to same outcome - desktop and say ms-dos console works, but launching file manager gives you black screen/error
