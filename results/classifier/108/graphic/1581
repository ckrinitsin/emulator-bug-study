 32)

Additional information:
1. This problem only occurs when the host system is windows, and the same QEMU configuration does not have this problem when the host system is Linux.
2. This problem is related to the -smp parameter of QEMU. If the smp parameter is 1, this problem will not occur.
3. This problem does not exist in the QEMU version 7.2.
