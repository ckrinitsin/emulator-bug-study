Mouse doesn't work correctly with SDL display backend
Description of problem:
The mouse starts moving like crazy, up and down or left and right.
I tested it with -accel on and off, I make some test and seems to be the SDL display backed(GTK just crash before start execution of the vm).
Steps to reproduce:
1.Install Linux Mint 22.1
2.Execute the command above.
3.Log in and the problems start.
