CXL Device Missing PCI_CAP_ID_PM (01h) in CAP List Implementation According to PCIe SPEC
Description of problem:
- The lack of **PCI_CAP_ID_PM (01h)** will not cause any crash or error when running QEMU, but it is violated to the PCIe SPEC.
- When some vendors test the power management capability (e.g., Linux Runtime PM), they must manually implement this CAP list to support the D1/D2/D3_Hot d-states changes.
- We don't see any PCI_CAP_ID_PM (01h) in the CXL rootport or endpoint
