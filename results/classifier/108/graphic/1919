UEFI SecureCode hangs on MacOs - 8.1.1 / MacOS Ventura
Description of problem:
Unable to load edk2 secure boot UEFI code. Non-secure edk2 bios works fine, but secure one hangs during load.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run mentioned command - it should display OVMF logo - but it hangs
Additional information:
* edk2-x86_64-code.fd works fine, edk2-x86_64-secure-code.fd not
* Tested with swtpm and without - doesn't matter
* TPM access has been observed (when swtpm enabled) - sounds like secure-code validation partially works

To enable TPM:
```
   -chardev socket,id=chrtpm,path=mytpm0/swtpm-sock \
   -tpmdev emulator,id=tpm0,chardev=chrtpm \
   -device tpm-tis,tpmdev=tpm0 \
```
and run swtpm
```
swtpm socket --tpm2 --tpmstate dir=mytpm0 --ctrl type=unixio,path=mytpm0/swtpm-sock
```
