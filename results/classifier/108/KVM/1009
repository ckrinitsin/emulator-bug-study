Nested KVM Networking Issue (OpenStack)
Description of problem:
Hi, 

Inside openstack i have an instance of Ubuntu 20.04 and i have installed KVM ( using virt-manager ) to setup a Virtual Machine ... i have done that and i created a VM of ubuntu 20.04 inside the Openstack Instance but there are networking issue while i set the default parameter as setting up the VM ( i mean the networking is as default to NAT ) , So when the VM is up and running the PING to 8.8.8.8 is available and also ping to google.com is also valid which shows that the DNS is correctly working ... but there is not connectivity with packages while i do sudo apt update, it will not get any package update and also the wget to google.com is shows that its connected to it but it wont able to download!!! the same happen with curl to any other websites...


I'm confirming that the openstack instance has full access to the internet including ping and wget , .... but the VM is not working correctly!

P.S. I have set the ip forwarding, Iptables , ... also disabled firewals but notting changed!!


Would you please fix this ?
Steps to reproduce:
1. creating an openstack instance from ubuntu 20.04 server image
2. updating and upgrading packages setting ip forwarding to 1 ( Enabled), firewall
3. and kernel to 5.13.0.40 and installing virt-manager then reboot 
3. creating a VM with default KVM networking ( NAT ) using ubuntu 20.04 server image
4. trying ping, wget, curl , ...


Thanks
Best regards
