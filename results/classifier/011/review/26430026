[BUG] cxl,i386: e820 mappings may not be correct for cxl

Context included below from prior discussion
    - `cxl create-region` would fail on inability to allocate memory
    - traced this down to the memory region being marked RESERVED
    - E820 map marks the CXL fixed memory window as RESERVED


Re: x86 errors, I found that region worked with this patch. (I also
added the SRAT patches the Davidlohr posted, but I do not think they are
relevant).

I don't think this is correct, and setting this to E820_RAM causes the
system to fail to boot at all, but with this change `cxl create-region`
succeeds, which suggests our e820 mappings in the i386 machine are
incorrect.

Anyone who can help or have an idea as to what e820 should actually be
doing with this region, or if this is correct and something else is
failing, please help!
