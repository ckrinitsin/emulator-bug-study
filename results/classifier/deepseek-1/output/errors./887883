This is latest result on qemu-1.0-rc3, and I notice that 'RESOURCE_LEAK' is 10 now:

I believe the ARM ones are bogus (although some could be clearer and simulataneously clear some of the warnings):

AFAIK a lot of issues reported by coverity have been addressed in the recent versions of QEMU ... is there still anything left here that needs special attention?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
