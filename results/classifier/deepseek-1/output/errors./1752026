I don't know what a pseries-bionic is, there is no reference to it upstream.

What you are seeing is expected behaviour as far as I can tell. POWER9 currently does not support HTM for a guest and thus it must not be turned on, otherwise qemu will fail to start.

HTM can be disabled from the qemu command line by setting cap-htm=off, as stated in the the error message. The pseries-2.12 machine type has htm disabled by default and thus with that machine type there is no requirement to set cap-htm=off on the command line to get qemu to start.

So depending on what machine pseries-bionic is based on it will be required to disable htm on the command line (with cap-htm=off) if it is not disabled by default for the machine.

== Comment: #13 - Satheesh Rajendran <email address hidden> - 2018-02-27 00:05:12 ==
Had a chat with Suraj and here is the summary

1. Currently Power9 DD2.2(host kernel) does not support HTM, so guest should be booted with cap-htm=off, looks like host kernel patch rework in progress--> Initial patch, https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm-ppc/msg13378.html
2. Libvirt does not know about this cap-htm yet and currently it does not set any default values?
3. pseries-2.12 does have cap-htm=off by default but not the older machine types, so we see the guest is booting from libvirt with pseries-2.12
4. Once 1 is fixed, we can boot cap-htm=on, I guess by that time pseries-2.12 to be changed to cap-htm=on bydefault.

---> 3. Immediate fix can be Canonical defaults their machine type(pseries-bioic) to pseries-2.12...
---> Future 1 and 4 to be addressed, not sure about 2?

Needs a mirror to Canonical to address this.

Hi, the long description in this bug is a little confusing. Some of the comments appear to suggest that the required support is not yet upstream.

Could the reporter confirm whether there any current upstream patches that require backporting urgently (the bug is marked as critical)?

Or whether further upstream work is required before backporting should begin.

Thanks, Andy.


Hi,
Thanks Andrew - I agree in general.
The following is based on the assumption that the linked discussion (kernel change) is not upstream yet.
Any clarification on that will help thou.

OTOH I want to start the discussion on the options we have early on.

I have seen the pseries-2.12 changes in the qemu 2.11.1 stable release (didn't like them).
Especially for things like those that you mentioned "... I guess by that time pseries-2.12 to be changed to cap-htm=on by default" is the reason I can't pick a 2.12 type until 2.12 is final and released.

We never can allow a case where pseries-2.12 != pseries-2.12 (for migrations and such).

So at the moment the default pseries-bionic is based on 2.11 being the usual default of qemu 2.11 and the one that is meant to be (and stay) stable.

So on the proposed change "3. Immediate fix can be Canonical defaults their machine type(pseries-bioic) to pseries-2.12" I'm reluctant to do so, as:
  - only pseries would be 2.12
  - there is a high chance we end up with 2.12 != 2.12 down the road


Suggestion #1:
If you (=IBM as the authoritative entity for Power) decide that you want htm to be off in the 2.11 machine type in the Ubuntu 18.04 (=Bionic) release we can do that (as Bionic is not released yet we can still change it).

But that would stay for the entire time of the Bionic release.
So pseries-bionic (the default) => pseries-2.11 (+htm off) will be the default until year 2023

Once (if) the host kernel at some point supports htm properly you can surely change the 2.12 type upstream, we would pick that up and later releases will default to a htm on case then.
Also people could run Bionic (which sets htm=off by default then) and run if needed with a htm=on override.

But even all that would mean that e.g. a new qemu from the Ubuntu cloud archive in a year, would fail the same on a 18.04 base kernel.

The real fix is to get that host support upstream (kernel) and get it in the Ubuntu kernel prior to the release of 18.04 - is that a realistic timeline, when do you expect this gets upstream?

I hope those clarifications helped to see why I think just choosing the 2.12 type is no option.

Thereby Counter-proposing:
1. in qemu we can make default pseries-bionic => pseries-2.11 (+htm off) if you want.
   That makes things safe to use for now, but OTOH htm an opt-in feature on Ubuntu 18.04
   That would stay that way for the support time of 18.04
OR
2. You get the kernel fix upstream asap and Ubuntu integrates before release of 18.04
   Then qemu/libvirt as is would work on P9 DD 2.2+
   (until that happens you can test with an override to set htm=off)


But any decision between #1/#2 depends very much on:
- the expected timeline of your kernel changes
- your preferenc in regard to the htm feature
So it is up to you to clarify on that as Andrew pointed out.

------- Comment From <email address hidden> 2018-02-27 22:50 EDT-------
1.
If it's decided thatwe want to default to cap-htm=off, then that can be achieved by adding:
```smc->default_caps.caps[SPAPR_CAP_HTM] = SPAPR_CAP_OFF;```
to the spapr-bionic machine class init

2.
What is the timeframe we are talking about here, a week/a month? It's hard to give a firm timeframe on the patches going upstream

For 1. I mostly agree, the default is currently off in code and in 2.11 there is this for backwards compatability:
  smc->default_caps.caps[SPAPR_CAP_HTM] = SPAPR_CAP_ON;

We would have to
- Moving that "keep the old default" entry to 2.10 (to cover <=2.10)
  spapr_machine_2_10_class_options
   smc->default_caps.caps[SPAPR_CAP_HTM] = SPAPR_CAP_ON;
- And we would set it explicit off in 2.11 (which is what pseries-bionic refers to)
  spapr_machine_2_11_class_options
   smc->default_caps.caps[SPAPR_CAP_HTM] = SPAPR_CAP_OFF;
- 2.12 we would not change IMHO, that might become whatever it becomes with 2.12 development


For #2 - this is a bug fix so it does not fall under the Feature Freeze (tomorrow).
But I don't know how much lead time the kernel team needs.
Given that kernel fixes are involved this clearly needs a kernel task for them to know about - adding ...

@Kernel - please read the context - what is the last date you'd need to have this commit upstream by IBM to be able to pick it and still be in the initial 18.04 release kernel (not in -updates)?

@IBM - how about this approach:
A) We switch the default to HTM=off in qemu "now" (as soon as you ack this) to be safe
B) If you get the kernel fixes upstream fast enough for the kernel Team to pick up in time:
  B1) a fixed kernel will be pushed (before 18.04 release)
  B2) we unroll this change in qemu (before 18.04 release)

That way we would surely have something that "works" by default via (A) and if (B) is in time we can switch back to "working but with HTM enabled".
And if (B) is too late we will keep HTM disabled in the 2.11/Bionic machine type.

Seems like the best option in my opinion

Sorry, but to be sure is that a clear "yes please disable HTM by default in qemu on ppc64el for Ubuntu 18.04" ?

Does it mean that we are not going to have HTM support on KVM guests, even in POWER8?

you would use the 2.10 machine type for that, right?

Right. This is about the new machine type.

To the mini-discussion above - yes it would be default off on P8 as well then.
But by selecting an older machine type, or - even better - using the new type but with cap-htm=on

Starting the fix in qemu early next week then (the one outlined as (A) in comment #4.


FYI: There is bug 1753826 which postponed the release/testing of this one a bit.
Currently in rebuild/test together.

Fix pushed to bionic proposed, I'll track migration after it built and some time for the tests have passed.

BTW - tests on P8 are already good on my side, and since the request from IBM came fro P9 I have to assume it will be good there. But e.g. cross release migration X->B and such I had tested explicitly to be sure.

That said, please be aware that this will be a remaining "itch" for you at the current solution.
If somebody had guests on pre-Xenial it will have HTM enabled by default.
If those users migrate to a P9 system on Bionic they will still carry the feature of HTM being enabled and run into the issue, but there is nothing we can do about it other than getting your kernel fix completed and integrated. But I thought I make you aware to be sure.

I went to https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg165629.html but it only has source code change for the problem.

Can Linux team build a patch against Ubuntu 18.04 kernel 4.15.0-12-generic for test team to install.  Thanks

- Today, I setup Ubuntu KVM on my Boston system using Ubuntu 18.04 daily build below

http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-server/daily/current/

- With today build, it no longer has the Transaction Memory error when start up a KVM guest. So the fix in this LTCbug mhave made it into Ubuntu daily build.

Hi Nguyen,

Pauls patch(https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/kvm-ppc/list/?series=35017) yet to get merged in linux master as of now{f36b7534b833 (HEAD -> master, upstream/master) Merge branch 'akpm' (patches from Andrew)}

Does ubuntu daily kernel include custom patches?

If it does not include custom patches and one reason why you do not hit the issue now, coz qemu disable cap-htm by default temporarily till the above kernel patches included, check if that is the case.

you can confirm the TM patches are included by explicitly start qemu-kvm command with cap-htm=on

Regards,
-Satheesh.

The patches that make it possible to use HTM in guests running on POWER9 processors are now in the PowerPC kernel maintainer tree and will be requested to get merged into kernel 4.17:

681c617b7c42 KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Work around TEXASR bug in fake suspend state
87a11bb6a7f7 KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Work around XER[SO] bug in fake suspend mode
4bb3c7a0208f KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Work around transactional memory bugs in POWER9
7672691a08c8 powerpc/powernv: Provide a way to force a core into SMT4 mode
b5af4f279323 powerpc: Add CPU feature bits for TM bug workarounds on POWER9 v2.2
9bbf0b576d32 powerpc: Free up CPU feature bits on 64-bit machines
dd0efb3f11cc powerpc: Book E: Remove unused CPU_FTR_L2CSR bit
c0d64cf9fefd powerpc: Use feature bit for RTC presence rather than timebase presence

Fom Paul Mackerras: for a backport, we can probably avoid the feature bit rework, I hope, and just find two free CPU feature bits. If there aren't 2 free feature bits then let me know, we might be able to scavenge some that are only used on Book E or something.

Since the kernel team is now investigating the integration of the kernel patches into bionic (the kernel bits are already Fix Committed), we should plan to get the temporary workaround again removed from qemu-kvm.
It's hard to time it in a way that the kernel changes are rolled-out and the qemu workaround got removed at the same time.
So this could lead to a short time of the qemu mitigation being reverted, but the kernel not yet being released, which would make you need the cap-htm=0ff workaround. But that way it would be much safer that both changes are available prior to the release of 18.04 Bionic.
Hence the question (to IBM) is if it would be okay to plan ahead and to get the qemu changes reverted back now?

Yes, we need the qemu workaround to be removed. I see all required kernel patches are in master-next of bionic. Understand that both of these cannot be timed.. but having qemu changes revert today.. would we get updated kernel and qemu in tomorrows daily build? just wanted to understand what would be time window..

It's not possible to turn around a kernel that quickly. I intend to get a kernel with the fix uploaded bionic-proposed today, but it takes a few days at minimum to get it built, tested, and promoted to the -release pocket.

@Seth - that is fine, for the Kernel we only need to rely on "will be out before Bionic release" and that looks good - don't feel pushed.
The updates were about asking IBM "If we assume the kernel fixes will be there, should we remove the qemu mitigation (as we can't remove it after Bionic release date)".

Hi Frank,

First of all, thanks for caring about this bug and accepting the out-of-the-tree patches.

You are right, the motivation to include this patchset is to re-enable the HTM in the KVM guests. So, we just need to schedule the fixes on both side.

Here are some assumptions I have:

1) If you need to revert the qemu-kvm "HTM off" patches right now, We can survive, since we have a internal kernel that contains the fix, and we can use this custom kernel in the mean time. Not a big deal.

2) On the other side, I understand that the Final Freeze for Ubuntu will be in April 19th, so, we still have some time to release qemu, how long can we wait without affecting the time to we spend testing this package?

3) Releasing the fixed kernel prior to the fixed qemu package would be better than the other way around.

4) Can't we fix fix qemu now and keep it in the proposed until the kernel is released?

Thanks!

One other possibility could be to have the changes going into the kernel and, then, remove the workaround from QEMU. QEMU with the workaround should continue to work with the kernel with the proper changes. HTM will be disabled in the guests, which would not be needed anymore, but would not block a VM from running.

Anyway, I am OK either way. We need to make progress here and I understand this came in late. We need to have the fixes in the kernel and the workaround out of QEMU. If that means we will have a broken QEMU for few days, that would be OK. We can continue our tests with previous versions of kernel and QEMU until everything is settled in bionic repositories or disable HTM by hand when running tests.

@Breno - I agree to #3 but since we have no hard ETA on the kernel I want to avoid punting qemu to the very last few days. History told me that always something happens/blocks and if we would miss GA we can't SRu to keep the final pseries-bionic type in sync.

For #4 there is no good "keep in proposed" for the current Dev release.

I discussed with lagarcia and JFH on IRC once more:
...
[15:02] <lagarcia_> cpaelzer, I am OK with that. TBH, we can live with QEMU removing the workaround now or after the kernel has been changed.
[15:05] <cpaelzer> there was a bug update by breno 3 minutes ago
[15:05] * cpaelzer is reading
[15:06] <cpaelzer> oh I see, and your comment - mirrored both at once
[15:06] <cpaelzer> my concern is that if anything comes up late
[15:06] <cpaelzer> we might end up with the qemu change not reverted
[15:07] <cpaelzer> as after release it becomes an issue
[15:07] <cpaelzer> and will no more be removable
[15:07] <cpaelzer> for consistency of the pseries-bionic type
[15:07] <jfh1> cpaelzer, lagarcia: ah - just saw the ticket update and a reply from Breno ...
[15:08] <cpaelzer> jfh1: do we have anything like an expected date by the kernel Team?
[15:08] <cpaelzer> I'd not want to wait with qemu later than end of this week TBH
[15:08] <cpaelzer> history teached me not to try changing things last minute
[15:08] <jfh1> cpaelzer: I agree - there is always the option to pin a package to prevent it from getting updated
[15:09] <jfh1> that can be an option for those guys who still need to KVM on P9 ...
[15:09] <cpaelzer> jfh1: lagarcia_: so are we agreeing that I'll revert the avoidance in qemu now considering the various constraints?
[15:09] * cpaelzer is +1
[15:10] <jfh1> I think so ...
[15:12] <lagarcia_> cpaelzer, yep
[15:13] <lagarcia_> cpaelzer, when the patches reach bionic kernel, everything should work out of the box. Meanwhile, we can implement the workaround by hand.


With all that said, I'm including the revert of the current mitigation from the next qemu upload.

Revert will be hanlded via bug 1761175

@ lagarcia and Breno:
People/tester who still need the patched qemu can prevent that from being upgraded by pinning it aka marking it as hold (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto).
Even in case of an accidental upgrade - it's easy to go again back to that version.

This bug is awaiting verification that the kernel in -proposed solves the problem. Please test the kernel and update this bug with the results. If the problem is solved, change the tag 'verification-needed-bionic' to 'verification-done-bionic'. If the problem still exists, change the tag 'verification-needed-bionic' to 'verification-failed-bionic'.

If verification is not done by 5 working days from today, this fix will be dropped from the source code, and this bug will be closed.

See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed for documentation how to enable and use -proposed. Thank you!
