RFE: Support spice via unix domain socket

According to the man page, spice can be only used via TCP/IP in opposite to VNC, which can also be configured to listen on a unix domain socket. To make it easy to use spice without exposing the interface, please support unix domain sockets as well. I can try  to provide a patch, if you can point me to the source code where TCP/IP socket is opened.

There is already support for that in spice-server afaik, though I don't remember the api or what commit, or if it's in a released version (well, it's surely in 0.11.0, but that's unstable). Sorry about the lack of details, I suggest you search spice-devel mailing list archive though. I think libvirt can already use it, but perhaps you want a commandline option, that may be missing.

you could pass sockets via QMP a while ago, but listening to unix socket has been added there:
