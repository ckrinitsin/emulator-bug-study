[Feature request] Oracle Solaris 11.4 VM image

We already have handy VMs to build QEMU within:

$ git grep -l basevm.BaseVM
tests/vm/centos
tests/vm/fedora
tests/vm/freebsd
tests/vm/netbsd
tests/vm/openbsd
tests/vm/ubuntu.i386

Some people have interest in building QEMU on Solaris:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-07/msg01429.html

To help them it would be useful to have a Solaris VM.

Solaris is not open anymore, so I don't think that you can get a distributable VM so easily.

I'm closing this since it's very unlikely that we get a Solaris VM image, since they are not available for free, as far as I know. Maybe somebody could contribute an illumos-based image one day, but that's nothing that we have to track in the bug tracker, I think.
