make check-venv may leave stale and incomplete tests/venv directory directory

As reported by "Philippe Mathieu-Daudé" <email address hidden>, a "make check-venv" can be run and fail to properly create a suitable virtual environment, leaving the tests/venv directory which is the target for "make check-venv" itself.

This means that on a subsequent run: 

> $ make check-venv
>   GIT     ui/keycodemapdb tests/fp/berkeley-testfloat-3
> tests/fp/berkeley-softfloat-3 dtc capstone slirp
> make: Nothing to be done for 'check-venv'.

And the venv will still be incomplete.  The causes of such failures to create a suitable virtual environment are too many (in the reported case it was because of missing *required* Python packages).  Some more evolved virtual environments + Python packaging systems exist that could probably be used here (Pipenv) but would add further core requirements.

The current mitigation is to run "make check-clean" when the venv appears to be incomplete.

The goal of this bug is to attempt to make the venv setup atomic and more reliable.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
