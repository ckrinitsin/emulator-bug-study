Docfix: add missing virtiofsd cache default 'auto'

The usage command line for virtiofsd has:

void fuse_cmdline_help(void)
{
    printf("    -h   --help                print help\n"
...
           "    -o cache=<mode>            cache mode. could be one of \"auto, "
           "always, none\"\n"
           "                               default: auto\n"


But the default: auto info is missing from the man page.  I suggest this patch:

+  The default is ``auto``.
