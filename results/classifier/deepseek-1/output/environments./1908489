qemu 4.2 bootloops with -cpu host and nested hypervisor

I've noticed that after upgrading from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04 that nested virtualization isn't working anymore.

I have a simple repro where I create a Windows 10 2004 guest and enable Hyper-V in it. This worked fine in 18.04 and specifically qemu <4.2 (I specifically tested Qemu 2.11-4.1 which work fine).

The -cpu arg I'm passing is simply:
    -cpu host,l3-cache=on,hv_relaxed,hv_spinlocks=0x1fff,hv_vapic,hv_time

Using that Windows won't boot because the nested hypervisor (Hyper-V) is unable to be initialize and so it just boot loops. Using the exact same qemu command works fine with 4.1 and lower.

Switching to a named CPU model like Skylake-Client-noTSX-IBRS instead of host lets the VM boot but causes some weird behaviour later trying to use nested VMs.

If I had to guess I think it would probably be related to this change https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/20a78b02d31534ae478779c2f2816c273601e869 which would line up with 4.2 being the first bad version but unsure.

For now I just have to keep an older build of QEMU to work around this. Let me know if there's anything else needed. I can also try out any patches. I already have at least a dozen copies of qemu lying around now.





Ok, after bisect between stable-4.1 and stable-4.2 I did confirm that https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/20a78b02d31534ae478779c2f2816c273601e869 is the first bad commit.

The full qemu command line is:

Ok, so I narrowed done one possible issue: the BNDCFGS bits in the vm entry/exit control MSRs are not set but HyperV expects them to be set if xsave is supported. This quick patch actually lets Hyper-V initialize and continue booting: https://gist.github.com/552baa8be026e67bef2d223076b81636

An alternative to that patch is just telling Hyper-V xsave is disabled. In the guest before enabling Hyper-V: bcdedit /set xsavedisable 1

Unfortunately while this does let the guest Hyper-V initialize, the nested (root) Windows guest doesn't boot and still gets stuck in a bootloop.

Try instead disabling MPX with "-cpu host,-mpx".


Aha! The final boot loop issue is resolved if I either upgrade to 5.10 or downgrade to 5.4 from 5.8.

So the main issue then seems to be the missing control bits.

Adding -mpx doesn't seem to help on 5.8, the guest still bootloops.

If you can bisect between 5.9 (I understand it's bad?) and 5.10 we could propose it for stable kernels.

I haven't tried 5.9, just:
- 5.4.0-58                     Works
- 5.8.0-33 (20.04 HWE Edge)    Bootloop
- 5.10.1-051001                Works

If I have time later I can try narrowing down which kernel causes the issue.

But is the BNDCFGS MSR issue considered a bug in qemu or what?

It's more likely to be a bug in KVM.

Oh, and I guess I misinterpreted what -mpx was for. To be clear, I was running into 2 issues:

1. Hyper-V fails to initialize.
   "Fixed" by one of:
     a) using named cpu model
     b) cpu=host and running `bcdedit /set xsavedisable 1` in Windows before enabling Hyper-V
     c) cpu=host,-mpx
     d) my hack-y patch from earlier

    (b) just tells Hyper-V to disable XSAVE support for its (nested) guests altogether whereas (c) is more fine=grained and just disables the BNDCFGx bits.

2. Hyper-V initializes but Windows bootloops. I only seem to run into this with 5.8 but not 5.4 or 5.10.

Ran into the same issue on Proxmox 6.3-3
Setting `bcdedit /set xsavedisable 1` and using cpu=host works for me
Without I get bootloops and other options that luqmana posted, Hyper-V fails to start

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


Looking at the comments here, I assume this has been a bug in the kernel, not in QEMU, so I'm closing this one now. If you still think this is something that needs fixing in QEMU, please open a new ticket in the new bug tracker at https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues instead.
