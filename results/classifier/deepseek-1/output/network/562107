QEmu GDB stub uses IPv6 instead of v4 (or both)

This bug has been reported by several people already.

See http://migeel.sk/blog/2009/04/21/gdb-and-qemu-on-windows/
and http://qemu-forum.ipi.fi/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=5579&p=16248&hilit=gdb+ipv6#p16248


Seems like a very easy fix.

There is an alternative way to force gdbserver to use ipv4 instead ipv6 without changing the source code. 

Use this command:

c:\>qemu -S -gdb tcp::1234,ipv4 <...other parameters>

Works for me until there is a bugfix for this.

Thanks.

I have a patch for this...

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
