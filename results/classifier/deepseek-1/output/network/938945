Slirp cannot be forward and makes segmentation faults

Hi,

Let's consider the following lines:

$ qemu -enable-kvm -name opeth -hda debian1.img -k fr -localtime -m 512 -net user,vlan=0 -net nic,vlan=0,model=$model,macaddr=a2:00:00:00:00:10 -net socket,vlan=1,listen=127.0.0.1:5900 -net nic,vlan=1,model=$model,macaddr=a2:00:00:00:00:04

$qemu -enable-kvm -name nightwish -hda debian2.img -k fr -localtime -m 512 -net socket,vlan=0,connect=127.0.0.1:5900 -net nic,vlan=0,model=$model,macaddr=a2:00:00:00:00:02


My configuration is clear and allows to transmit packets between the Slirp and the guest nightwish.
But when I try to do on nightwish :

$ wget www.qemu.org

The opeth QEMU makes a segfault :    "11586 Segmentation Fault"

This phenomenon is not always present... If the Segfault does not appear, nightwish cannot enable a connection with internet :(


Thanks

Which version of QEMU did you use? Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU?
