QEMU-SYSTEM-PPC64 Regression QEMU-4.0.0

I have been using QEMU-SYSTEM-PPC64 v3.1.0 to run CentOS7 PPC emulated system. It stopped working when I upgraded to QEMU-4.0.0 . I downgraded back to QEMU-3.1.0 and it started working again. The problem is that my CentOS7 image will not boot up udner QEMU-4.0.0, but works fine under QEMU-3.1.0.

I have an QCOW2 image available at https://www.mediafire.com/file/d8dda05ro85whn1/linux-centos7-ppc64.qcow2/file . NOTE: It is 15GB. Kind of large.

I run it as follows:

   qemu-system-ppc64 \
      -name "CENTOS7-PPC64" \
      -cpu POWER7 -machine pseries \
      -m 4096 \
      -netdev bridge,id=netbr0,br=br0 \
      -device e1000,netdev=netbr0,mac=52:54:3c:13:21:33 \
      -hda "./linux-centos7-ppc64.qcow2" \
      -monitor stdio

HOST: I am using Manjaro Linux on an Intel i7 machine with the QEMU packages installed via the package manager of the distribution.

I suspect that this may be related to the VSR register conversion. Can you try applying all of the patches below on top of 4.0 to see if they resolve the issue?

I applied the four patches you indicated and the image boots up and runs. Everything seems to be working now. Thank You.

I also have a regression issue between 3.1.0 and 4.0.0 (actually latest git) on qemu-system-ppc64 but it involves an AIX guest instead (fail to boot). Should I open a new ticket or hop on this one ?

David has already queued the patches in his ppc-for-4.1 branch at https://github.com/dgibson/qemu/commits/ppc-for-4.1 so they will get merged soon. If you're working with git then I'd try testing the queued branch first and see if that resolves the issue.

Once the patches have been applied to master we'll add a CC to the stable list so the fixes will be included in the next 4.0 update.

Same thing here using https://github.com/dgibson/qemu/commits/ppc-for-4.1 ... It might be a completely different problem (athough it looks like a MMU problem).

Is this fixed now? Can we mark as fix committed?

It is fixed with the 4.1.0 release. Thank you.
