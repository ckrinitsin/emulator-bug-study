Qemu segfaults at start regardles if i suply an image or not

I have tried both with latest development (git clone git://git.qemu.org/qemu.git ran around 12:00 2011-01-30) and with  qemu-0.13.0. Since i have not written c-code in the last years, and never really ran a debugger under Linux this will bug report will be a bit sketchy.

When starting qemu, either just qemu or with an image it segfaults. The Qemu window flashes by and then i get the segfault message (qemu -nographic still segfaults so i guess it is not really graphics related).   When starting qemu with a garbled command line it returns an error and exits normally how ever.

uname -a
Linux LIX 2.6.33.4-smp #2 SMP Wed May 12 22:47:36 CDT 2010 i686 AMD Phenom(tm) II X4 810 Processor AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux

I have tried recompiling with --disable-kvm since i run a 32 bit OS on a 64 bit CPU, but to no avail.



I assume this has been fixed with one of the later versions of QEMU .... Or do you still have this issue with the latest version of QEMU? If yes, can you please add the information which Linux distribution you are using, and provide a fresh backtrace with the latest version of QEMU? Thanks!
