ReplayKernel.test_x86_64_pc fails intermittently

Even though this acceptance test is already skipped on GitLab CI, the intermittent failures can be seen on other environments too.

The record phase works fine, but during the replay phase fail to finish booting the kernel (until the expected place):

On my workstation, I can replicate the failure roughly once every 50 runs.

I'm actually able to increase the reproducibility to ~ 90% when running 8 of those tests simultaneously (on an 8 core system).

I can 100% reproduce it with the following command line:
taskset 1 tests/venv/bin/avocado --show=app,console,replay run -t arch:x86_64 ../tests/acceptance/replay_kernel.py

But I can't reproduce it outside the avocado toolchain, by running qemu directly.

I traced this bug to hw/char/serial.c/serial_ioport_read

Bug disappears when I add qemu_log("serial_ioport_read %x %x\n", (int)addr, ret); into the end of this function.

I suppose that there is avocado (or socket) io synchronization problem, because running the same test without avocado works normally.

I could reproduce this without Avocado:

--
#!/bin/bash

SOCKET="/tmp/qemu.sock"
VMLINUZ_PATH="/tmp/vmlinuz"
REPLAY_FILE="/tmp/replay.bin"

function run_and_wait() {
        /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -display none \
                                    -vga none  \
                                    -machine pc \
                                    -chardev socket,id=console,path=${SOCKET},server=on,wait=off \
                                    -serial chardev:console \
                                    -icount shift=5,rr=$1,rrfile=${REPLAY_FILE} \
                                    -kernel ${VMLINUZ_PATH} \
                                    -append "printk.time=1 panic=-1 console=ttyS0" -net none -no-reboot &
        # Wait a little for the socket creation
        sleep 1
        socat - UNIX-CONNECT:${SOCKET}
        echo $?
}


run_and_wait "record"
echo "Was this (record) finished?"

run_and_wait "replay"
echo "Was this (replay) finished?"
--

The second echo is never displayed and my console stops here:

---
[    0.036667] Speculative Store Bypass: Vulnerable
[    0.256061] random: fast init done
[    0.308652] Freeing SMP alternatives memory: 36K
---

I was able to run the reproducer from Beraldo Leal, and achieved the same results.

Additionally, I got the following output from QEMU:

   qemu-system-x86_64: Missing character write event in the replay log

Which seems to come from replay/replay-char.c:158.

I then tested the record and replay separately, and found that, while the above message is given and QEMU exits at the replay phase, the amount of CPUs given to the *record* stage actually make the difference.  When the recording is done with a single CPU, the replay log seems to be written with the "missing character write event".

Beraldo, thanks for the script.
However, I can't reproduce the bug using it. I've got the newest QEMU from the repository, and it never hangs in this scenario.

But there are some problems in other runs with more complex tasks.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
