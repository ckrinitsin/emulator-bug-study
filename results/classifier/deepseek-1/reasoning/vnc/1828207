Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user is talking about adding log reports for authentication failures in the built-in VNC server of QEMU. They mention that without logs, it's hard to analyze brute force attacks and integrate with automated systems like fail2ban. They suggest logging something like "QEMU VNC Authentication failed" along with IP addresses.

They also note that using the built-in VNC-auth scheme is a security flaw, especially on public-facing services, and recommend using VeNCrypt with TLS and SASL for better security. There's a discussion about whether to deprecate or remove the feature because it's insecure but necessary for protocol compatibility.

The categories I have are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the issue, it's specifically about VNC authentication and logging. The main problem is that there are no logs for failed authentications, making it hard to detect brute force attacks. They're suggesting adding a log message, which relates directly to VNC functionality. There's also a mention of security concerns but the primary request is about enhancing logging.

So the category should be 'vnc' because it's focused on the VNC server in QEMU and its authentication features.
