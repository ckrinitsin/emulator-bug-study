Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the specified categories for QEMU. The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report mentions issues with the VNC websocket option not being parsed correctly when running on the command line. The user is experiencing errors like "address resolution failed for tor:on" and notes that removing the websocket part makes it work. They also mention a commit that caused this regression and another patch that fixed it in version 2.9.0.

Looking at the categories, the issue clearly relates to VNC functionality within QEMU. The problem is with parsing command-line options specific to VNC, particularly involving websockets. This points directly to the 'vnc' category since it's about how VNC server parameters are handled.
