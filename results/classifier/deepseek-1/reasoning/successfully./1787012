Okay, so I'm trying to build QEMU on my Solaris 10 system, and I ran into this weird issue where the Makefile is throwing a "Bad string" error. The compilation process stops at that point, and no executable gets created. It's frustrating because I followed all the usual steps and nothing seems to be working.

First, let me look through the build output again. There's this line in the Makefile for DTC (Device Tree Compiler) that is causing problems. The error message says "Bad string", but it doesn't specify where exactly or what it refers to. I remember seeing something about a HOSTOS variable in the Makefile. Let me check that.

Looking at the Makefile, I see this line:
HOSTOS := $(shell uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed -e 's/\(cygwin\|msys\).*/\1/')

Hmm, so it's using `tr` to convert uppercase letters to lowercase and then running a substitution with `sed`. On my system, when I run `uname -s`, it returns "SunOS". So the command is trying to process "SunOS" through `tr` and `sed`.

Wait, maybe the issue is with how `tr` is handling the input on Solaris. Let me test that. If I open a terminal and type:
uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'

I get "sunos", which seems correct. Then, if I run the whole command as in the Makefile:
uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed -e 's/\(cygwin\|msys\).*/\1/'

Since "sunos" doesn't match cygwin or msys, it just returns "sunos". So why is the Makefile giving a "Bad string" error? Maybe `tr` isn't handling the range correctly on Solaris.

I recall that sometimes older versions of `tr` might not support certain syntax. Let me check what version I'm using by typing:
/usr/bin/tr --version

It says something like SunOS 5.10, which is Solaris 10. So perhaps the `tr` command in /usr/bin isn't handling the '[:upper:]' range correctly. Maybe it's expecting a different syntax or doesn't support ranges as expected.

I remember that POSIX-compliant `tr` commands should handle these ranges, but sometimes non-POSIX compliant versions might cause issues. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing some environment setup that would allow this command to work properly.

Another thought: perhaps the issue is not with the Makefile line itself but with how it's being executed by gmake (GNU make). If gmake is encountering an error when trying to evaluate that shell command, it might be due to some misconfiguration or missing tools.

Wait, earlier I tried replacing the HOSTOS line with a static value like "SunOS" and saw that the build proceeds past that point. That suggests that the problem was indeed with how the Makefile was determining HOSTOS. The dynamic evaluation using `tr` and `sed` was causing an error on Solaris.

So, to fix it, setting HOSTOS directly might be a workaround. But I wonder why the original line worked for others but not me. Maybe because of the specific version or configuration of my system's tools.

I also remember that sometimes having multiple versions of commands in the PATH can cause issues. For instance, if /usr/xpg4/bin (which has POSIX-compliant utilities) comes before /usr/bin, it might resolve some compatibility problems. Let me check my PATH variable:

echo $PATH

It shows something like /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin. There's no /usr/xpg4/bin in there. Maybe adding that directory to the beginning of PATH would help.

Alternatively, I could try using the POSIX-compliant `tr` from /usr/xpg4/bin explicitly in the Makefile. That might prevent the "Bad string" error.

Another idea: perhaps the problem is with how the Makefile is invoking the shell or processing the output. Maybe there's a way to modify the command to be more compatible with Solaris' tools.

In summary, my initial thought was that the `tr` command in Solaris 10 isn't handling '[:upper:]' as expected, leading to the "Bad string" error when evaluating HOSTOS in the Makefile. To fix it, I can either adjust the PATH to use a more compliant version of `tr` or set HOSTOS manually to avoid running that problematic command.

The issue arises because the `HOSTOS` variable in the Makefile uses `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`, which causes a "Bad string" error on Solaris 10 when evaluating `uname -s`. To resolve this, you can:

1. **Set HOSTOS Manually**: Modify the Makefile to assign `HOSTOS` directly, such as setting it to "sunos".

2. **Use POSIX-Compliant Tools**: Ensure that `/usr/xpg4/bin` is in your PATH before `/usr/bin` so that the `tr` command used is POSIX-compliant.

3. **Adjust the Command Syntax**: Change the `tr` command to use a compatible format, like specifying individual characters instead of ranges if possible.

By implementing one or more of these solutions, you can bypass the "Bad string" error and allow the build process to proceed successfully.
