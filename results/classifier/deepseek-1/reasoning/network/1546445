Okay, so I'm looking at this bug report related to QEMU. The user wants me to classify it into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is about supporting vhost-user without specifying the vhostforce option. The issue is that when using vhost-user, it falls back to virtio-net, which causes a performance loss unless the vhostforce option is used. However, by default, vhost-user should be enabled because guests using PMD (like PXE stage) don't support MSI-X.

Looking at the categories, I need to determine which one fits best. The problem revolves around network device behavior in QEMU. Vhost-user is a type of VirtIO net device that's optimized for better performance but requires specific configuration.

The keywords here are 'vhost-user', 'network', and performance implications. Since it's related to how the network backend behaves, particularly with vhost-user not being enabled by default when it should be for certain guests, the most fitting category is 'network'. The issue doesn't pertain to assembly or mistranslation; it's more about device behavior in the networking stack.

So, the category that best describes this bug is 'network'.
