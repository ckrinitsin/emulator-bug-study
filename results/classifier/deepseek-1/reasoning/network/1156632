Alright, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is having trouble with their custom QMP implementation when using system_reset. They mentioned that after sending the system_reset command and receiving a reply, closing the socket causes the next connection attempt to fail because the QMP connection dies.

In the first scenario, they sent system_reset, got a reply, closed the socket, and then couldn't reconnect. In the second case, they received two RESET events after system_reset before closing, which allowed them to connect again without issues. They're wondering if this is expected behavior or a bug in QEMU's QMP implementation.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, other.

The issue revolves around the handling of events after sending system_reset and how connections are managed afterward. The problem seems to be related to the QMP protocol's event handling and connection management. Since it's about communication between the client and QEMU via sockets, the most relevant categories would be 'socket' or possibly 'network'. 

The user is dealing with the QMP socket not accepting new connections after certain operations, which points towards a problem in how the socket is being managed by QEMU when handling events. This could be due to improper event processing leading to the socket being closed or not properly reinitializing for new connections.

I think 'socket' is the most fitting category because it's about the communication channel between the client and QEMU, specifically regarding connection handling after sending commands.
