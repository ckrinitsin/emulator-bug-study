Okay, I need to classify this bug report from QEMU. Let me read through it carefully. The user is having issues with USB devices freezing when forwarded into a VM using QEMU. Specifically, they mention isochronous USB devices like webcams and HID-Audio devices. These devices work for a few minutes but then stop until the VM reboots or Windows driver reloads.

The bug occurs regardless of whether they use qemu-xhci or nec-xhci controllers. They've tried both QEMU versions 2.11.2 and the master branch, so it's not a version-specific issue. Reproducing the problem involves setting up a VM with USB redirection via Virt-manager, modifying XML to include an XHCI controller, installing Windows, and redirecting a USB soundcard or headset.

The user has also reached out on Qemu-devel but isn't subscribed there yet. They provided pcap files for analysis. However, after 60 days without further activity, the bug was marked as Expired in QEMU's system.

Now, looking at the classification options: it's about USB device handling in QEMU. Since the issue is related to USB redirection and hardware devices not functioning correctly over time, this falls under the "input" category because USB devices often handle input (like HID devices) or are used for audio input/output. Alternatively, it could be classified under "usb," but since the user's response indicated it's about input device behavior, I'll go with "input."

Wait, but is there a more specific category? The problem involves USB redirection and device freezing, which might also relate to hardware emulation or device passthrough. However, given that the issue is about input devices not working as expected after some time, "input" seems appropriate.

So, the classification should be under "input."

The bug report describes an issue with USB devices freezing when redirected into a QEMU VM. This problem specifically affects input devices like webcams and audio headsets, which fall under the category of input handling in QEMU. Therefore, the appropriate classification is:

**Input**

This classification captures the essence of the issue as it pertains to how input devices are managed within the virtual environment.
