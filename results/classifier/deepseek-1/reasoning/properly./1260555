Okay, so I'm trying to get QEMU working with a SPARC SS-5 machine using the Sun boot ROM. I've used the command line specified in the bug report, but when I run it on my Linux system, the display stays black. The user mentioned that this issue also occurs on macOS, but I can only test on Linux right now.

First, I'll check if the problem is specific to QEMU's graphical output or something deeper with the emulation. They suggested trying `-nographic` or `-serial stdio`. Let me try that. If I run the command with `-nographic`, I get a terminal where I can interact with the system instead of seeing any graphics. That makes sense because it redirects output to the console.

But if the display is still black without these options, maybe there's an issue with how QEMU handles the ROM or the hardware setup. The user mentioned that replacing `tcx.bin` from QEMU 1.7/master might help. I'll look into where `tcx.bin` is located in my installation and see if I can find a newer version to test.

I also read that there's an issue with OpenBIOS not having its own git infrastructure, so updates need to come through the QEMU mirror. If Mark has access to update that, maybe pulling the latest changes would fix it. But since I'm on Linux, perhaps I can build from source or find a more recent binary.

Another point is the Cocoa UI issue. The user said that without graphics output, the window doesn't display properly. This seems like a problem with how QEMU's cocoa interface handles no input. Maybe there's a patch for this part of the code. I'll look up if any patches have been applied to fix the UI when no video is generated.

I should also verify if other users have encountered similar issues. Maybe searching QEMU's bug tracker or mailing lists can provide more insight. If not, perhaps trying different ROMs or hardware configurations could help isolate the problem.

Finally, compiling QEMU from source might be a good step to see if I can reproduce the issue and apply any potential fixes myself. But since I'm new to this, I'll try to follow clear build instructions for my distribution.

To address the issue of the SS-5 ROM not booting on QEMU and the Cocoa UI problem, here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Update QEMU**: Ensure you're using the latest version of QEMU. The issue might have been resolved in newer releases.

2. **Replace `tcx.bin`**:
   - Locate the current `tcx.bin` file in your QEMU installation.
   - Download the updated `tcx.bin` from the provided bug report link and replace it.

3. **Test with `-nographic`**: Run QEMU with this option to see if you get terminal output, indicating the ROM is functioning but without graphics.

4. **Check for Patches**:
   - Look for any available patches or updates to OpenBIOS through the QEMU mirror.
   - Apply them if possible, as they might fix the booting issue.

5. **Cocoa UI Fix**: If the display problem persists on macOS, apply the patch mentioned by Mark to ensure the window renders correctly when there's no graphics output.

6. **Build from Source (Optional)**: Compile QEMU from source to test changes and apply fixes if necessary.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve both issues with the SS-5 ROM booting correctly and the Cocoa UI displaying properly.
