Okay, I need to figure out whether the patch 2a53535af471f4bee9d6cb5b363746b8d5ed21dd alone is sufficient for fixing the performance issue in QEMU when running on Bionic (Ubuntu 18.04). The user mentioned that the problem is just slowness, not a complete breakage, which makes it harder to address as they approach the release.

Looking at the provided context, there's an Ubuntu package changelog for qemu version 2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu6. This includes several patches aimed at fixing specific issues:

1. **Removal of HTM feature disabling**: Fixes LP #1761175.
2. **Enabling SSE/AVX/AVX512 features**: Addresses LP #1739665.
3. **Making Arm space+commpage continuous**: Solves LP #1740219, which seems to be the one causing slow startup times for qemu-user-static.
4. **Adding pseries-bionic-2.11-sxxm type**: Fixes LP #1761372.
5. **Handling filesystem-dax with pmem**: Related to LP #1704312.
6. **Adding domainname option to slirp's DHCP server**: Fixes LP #1762315.

The user tested the patch 2a53535af471f4bee9d6cb5b363746b8d5ed21dd and saw a significant improvement in performance, from 0.068s to 0.002s. They believe this single patch is sufficient.

I should verify if the specific issue causing slowness was addressed by this particular commit. If that's the case, then including only this patch might be enough without introducing other changes that could potentially cause more issues or require additional testing.

Since the user also mentioned that further patches are being considered but haven't been added yet, focusing on this minimal fix makes sense for now to avoid unnecessary regressions.

The patch 2a53535af471f4bee9d6cb5b363746b8d5ed21dd is sufficient as a standalone fix for the performance issue in QEMU on Bionic, particularly addressing LP #1740219 which caused slow startup times. 

**Answer:**
The patch 2a53535af471f4bee9d6cb5b363746b8d5ed21dd alone is sufficient for the fix, as it resolves the specific performance issue without introducing other changes that could affect stability or require additional testing.
