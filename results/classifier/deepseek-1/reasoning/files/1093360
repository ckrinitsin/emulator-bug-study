Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through it carefully.

The user reports that when mounting files from Microsoft ISO images in a QEMU VM, the version info is stripped, causing issues like failed UAG installation. They provided a link explaining the root cause and mentioned using specific QEMU/KVM versions.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem is about ISO files in a VM losing version info. It's related to how QEMU handles file mounting or the way it interacts with the guest OS. Since this involves handling of files within the VM, the category might be 'files'. Alternatively, since it's a virtualization issue affecting file metadata, perhaps 'KVM' or 'hypervisor'.

But 'files' seems more specific because the problem is about file information being altered when mounted. The other categories like network or graphic don't fit here.

I think the best fit is 'files'.
