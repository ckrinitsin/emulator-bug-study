Okay, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is talking about qemu-img not allowing resizing images that have snapshots. So, they want to resize a disk image but can't because there are snapshots associated with it. They're unsure if it's technically possible but think it would be nice to support.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Hmm, qemu-img is a utility for managing disk images in QEMU. Resizing an image with snapshots involves modifying the file structure while maintaining snapshot information. This doesn't seem to be related to translation issues or assembly lowering. It's more about how the image files are handled, specifically when snapshots are involved.

Snapshots in QEMU typically involve saving the state of the virtual machine at a certain point, which is stored as part of the disk image. Modifying the image size would affect these snapshots because each snapshot has its own disk size associated with it. So, the problem here is about file handling and possibly how snapshots are managed within those files.

The user mentioned that when applying a snapshot from a time when the image had a different size, the image size reverts. This suggests that the issue is related to how the images and their snapshots are structured and handled in terms of file operations. 

Looking at the categories again: 'files' seems appropriate because it's about manipulating disk images, which are files. Alternatively, maybe 'other', but 'files' seems more precise. The problem isn't with performance or permissions directly; it's about the ability to modify image size when snapshots exist.

So, I think the correct category is 'files'.
