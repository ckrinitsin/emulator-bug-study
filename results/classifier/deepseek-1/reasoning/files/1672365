Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is experiencing an issue with QEMU where a nested 9PFS read fails, leading to a Linux kernel panic in their guest OS. They mentioned that after the panic, the QEMU process uses 100% CPU, which they suspect might be a QEMU bug.

Looking at the setup details, it involves multiple layers of virtualization: NixOS on the host and guests, using VirtFS for mounting file systems, and KVM as the hypervisor. The user provided two different command-line setups where similar issues occur.

The problem occurs when the init process in the guest fails to read from the 9PFS after the initrd mounts it. This failure causes the kernel panic. They also noticed that QEMU keeps using 100% CPU post-panic, which they think is a sign of a QEMU issue.

Possible categories include hypervisor, device, network, etc. Since the bug involves VirtFS and the guest's file system mounting over 9P protocol, it relates to how QEMU handles filesystems in virtual machines. The kernel panic suggests an issue with how the initrd or the VirtFS is being managed by QEMU.

The high CPU usage might be due to a loop or infinite processing within QEMU when handling the panic, but more likely, the root cause is in the file system layer. Since this relates to VirtFS and filesystem operations, the most appropriate category seems to be 'files'.
