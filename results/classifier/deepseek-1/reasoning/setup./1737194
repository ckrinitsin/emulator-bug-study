Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why Windows NT 4.0 isn't booting from a qcow2 image in QEMU after installation. The user mentioned that they can install it once, but when they try to reboot, it fails with either a disk read error for NTFS or "No bootable device" for FAT. They also noticed that using the older qcow format works as a quick fix.

First, I remember that qcow2 is a more modern and efficient image format compared to the older qcow. Maybe there's an issue with how QEMU handles the bootloader information in qcow2 images for certain operating systems like Windows NT 4.0. 

Looking at the steps provided by the user, they created a qcow2 image, installed Windows NT via CD, and then upon rebooting without the CD, it fails to boot. This suggests that the installation process might not be correctly setting up the bootloader or partition information in the qcow2 file.

I should check if there are known issues with QEMU's handling of qcow2 images for older Windows versions. The user mentioned that using qcow instead of qcow2 works, which makes me think it's a format-specific problem. Maybe qcow doesn't have the same issues because it's simpler or has fewer features that could interfere.

I'll look into whether QEMU properly supports booting from qcow2 images for Windows NT 4.0. If this is a bug that's been reported before, perhaps it's already been fixed in newer versions of QEMU. The user mentioned their qemu version as 2.10.1, which might be older. So maybe updating to the latest version could resolve the issue.

Alternatively, there might be something about how the image is prepared. For instance, when using another VM (Windows XP) to format the qcow2 file to FAT, perhaps some QEMU-specific metadata or partitions are not correctly set up for Windows NT 4.0 to recognize upon booting from the image.

I should also consider checking if there's a way to convert the qcow2 image to raw format and see if that helps with booting. Raw images sometimes have better compatibility because they're more straightforward in structure.

Additionally, I might look into whether any specific QEMU command-line options are needed when using Windows NT 4.0 with qcow2, such as specifying certain disk drivers or enabling features that support older OSes.

In summary, the problem seems to stem from how qcow2 images are handled by QEMU for booting older Windows versions like NT 4.0. Potential solutions include updating QEMU, converting the image format, or adjusting QEMU's configuration when starting the VM.

The issue arises because QEMU's handling of qcow2 images may not properly set up bootloader information necessary for older operating systems like Windows NT 4.0 to boot correctly. The following structured solution addresses this problem:

1. **Check QEMU Version**: Ensure you are using the latest version of QEMU, as updates might have resolved issues with qcow2 compatibility for older OSes.

2. **Image Conversion**: Convert the qcow2 image to raw format if needed, as raw images can offer better compatibility:
   ```bash
   qemu-img convert -f raw windows95.qcow2 windows95.raw
   ```

3. **QEMU Configuration**: Use specific QEMU options that might aid in booting older systems. For example:
   ```bash
   qemu-system-i386 -hda windows95.raw -boot c -cpu pentium -vga cirrus
   ```

4. **Alternative Image Format**: As a workaround, create the image using the qcow format instead of qcow2 to bypass potential issues:
   ```bash
   qemu-img create -f qcow windows95.qcow 2G
   ```

By implementing these steps, you can test whether the issue persists and determine the most effective solution for your setup.
