Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why my QEMU is crashing with these SIGABRT and segfaults. It's been happening a lot lately when running Ubuntu 16.04 guests. The crashes usually point to qemu_coroutine_enter(), which is part of the QEMU codebase.

First, I remember reading that Stefan suggested reporting this issue against the Ubuntu package instead of upstream QEMU. That makes sense because sometimes issues are fixed in the packaging process or specific to how QEMU is compiled and used in Ubuntu.

But then, if the problem also happens with newer versions like qemu.git/master or QEMU 2.9-rc0, it might be better to report it upstream where more people might be looking for such bugs. I'm not entirely sure which version of QEMU I'm using right now. Since it's from the Ubuntu repositories, it's probably an older stable version.

Looking at the backtrace provided, it shows that the crash happens in qemu_coroutine_enter() function. The frame details show addresses and some structures related to coroutines. Co-routines are used for non-blocking operations, so maybe there's a race condition or improper synchronization happening here.

The user mentioned that this only occurs with Ubuntu 16.04 guests, which could mean it's specific to how the guest OS interacts with QEMU's coroutine handling. Perhaps some syscalls in the guest are causing issues on the host side.

I also see that there was a commit (528f449) mentioned as fixing this issue. I should check if my current QEMU version includes this commit. If not, updating to a newer version of QEMU might solve the problem. But since it's an Ubuntu package, they might have backported the fix.

Alternatively, maybe there's a configuration option or a setting that can be adjusted in QEMU to prevent these crashes. Looking into QEMU's documentation for coroutine handling could provide some clues, but I'm not too familiar with all the options.

Another thought: since this is happening frequently, it might be worth collecting more detailed backtraces and logs to see if there are common patterns or specific triggers that cause the crash. Maybe certain operations in the guest OS lead to the issue, like networking, disk I/O, or VM configuration.

I should also consider whether other guests on my system behave differently. If only Ubuntu 16.04 is affected, it might be related to how that particular version handles certain syscalls or interacts with QEMU's virtualization environment.

In summary, the steps I need to take are:

1. Check which version of QEMU I'm running using `qemu --version`.
2. Look into whether this specific issue has been addressed in newer versions or if it's already fixed in my current setup.
3. If it's an upstream bug with a known fix, ensure that the Ubuntu package includes the patch or consider building from source with the fix applied.
4. Collect more detailed backtraces and logs to identify any common triggers for these crashes.
5. Report the issue to the appropriate bug tracker—probably Launchpad for the Ubuntu package—and provide all the necessary information including the backtrace, affected QEMU version, guest OS details, etc.

I think starting with step 1 will give me a clearer picture of where I stand. If it's indeed an older version without the fix, then updating or applying patches could resolve the issue.

The problem involves frequent SIGABRT and segfaults in QEMU when running Ubuntu 16.04 guests, specifically within the `qemu_coroutine_enter()` function. The analysis suggests that:

1. **Check QEMU Version**: Determine the current version of QEMU installed to see if it includes a relevant fix.
2. **Consider Upstream vs. Packaging Issue**: Since the issue occurs in an Ubuntu package, report it through Launchpad unless newer versions (like `qemu.git/master` or 2.9-rc0) reproduce the issue, which would warrant upstream reporting.
3. **Investigate Coroutines and Fixes**: The commit `528f449f590829b53ea01ed91817a695b540421d` is mentioned as fixing the issue, so ensure your QEMU version includes this patch.
4. **Collect More Information**: Gather detailed backtraces and logs to identify potential triggers and patterns in the crashes.

**Solution Steps:**

- Verify the installed QEMU version using `qemu-system-x86_64 --version`.
- If not already updated, consider updating QEMU or applying the relevant patch if available in your distribution.
- Report the issue to the Ubuntu bug tracker (Launchpad) with detailed information for further investigation.

By following these steps, you can address the root cause and potentially resolve the crashes affecting your QEMU setup.
