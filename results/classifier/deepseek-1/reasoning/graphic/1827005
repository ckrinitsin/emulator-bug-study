Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's see what the issue is about. The user reported a problem with QEMU using HVF acceleration on macOS where the Ubuntu Server installation ISO's boot menu shows fractured images. 

Looking at the provided possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about the graphical display of the boot menu being broken. Since it's related to how graphics are rendered when using HVF acceleration on macOS, I think this falls under the 'graphic' category because it's a visual issue during the boot process.
