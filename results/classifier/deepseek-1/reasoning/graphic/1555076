Alright, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let's start by reading through the problem description carefully.

The user is reporting that when they try to run QEMU 2.5 using either SDL or GTK display configurations with OpenGL enabled (using options like -display sdl,gl=on or -display gtk,gl=on), the program crashes with an error message: "ERROR:ui/console-gl.c:95:surface_gl_create_texture: code should not be reached". They provided their OS details as Debian Jessie on a P5020 PPC64 machine with 4GB RAM and an AMD GPU. They also included OpenGL information from their Mesa drivers, version 11.3.

They mentioned that the issue persists across different Mesa versions, both older and stable releases. Additionally, they referenced another bug report (Launchpad #1581796) and indicated that a fix has been pulled into QEMU's git repository with commit 2c2311c5451f4555e850772, which was included in version 2.7.

Now, looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The error message points to a problem in "ui/console-gl.c", which suggests it's related to the graphical interface or OpenGL rendering. The issue arises when using display options with GL enabled, so it's definitely a graphics-related bug.

Considering the categories, "graphic" seems like the most appropriate since it involves OpenGL and the display subsystem. Other possible categories like 'device' could be considered if it were hardware-specific, but here the problem is more about how QEMU handles the graphical output rather than specific devices.

So, putting it all together, the bug relates to the graphics part of QEMU, hence it should be categorized under "graphic".

The error occurs in the OpenGL-related code within QEMU's UI handling, specifically when trying to create a texture. Since this is related to graphical rendering and display configuration, the appropriate category is:

**graphic**
