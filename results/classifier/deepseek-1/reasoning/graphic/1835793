Okay, so I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is working with QEMU and trying to run a custom BIOS they developed. They successfully ran the EDK2 BIOS using a specific command: qemu-system-x86_64.exe with the OVMF.fd file and no network. But when they use their personalized BIOS, QEMU gives an error saying "guest has not initialized display."

The user is confused because both BIOSes are EDK2-based, so they expect it to work similarly. The main difference is that their BIOS has more features.

In the explanation provided, two possible reasons for the issue are given: either the guest isn't outputting to the display (maybe using serial instead) or the guest code crashes before initializing the display. It also suggests that the problem might be due to hardware assumptions in the BIOS not matching QEMU's setup.

So, looking at the categories provided:

- Mistranslation
- Assembly lowering
- Other
- Device
- Graphic
- Socket
- Network
- KVM
- Boot
- VNC
- Debug
- Files
- Permissions
- Performance
- Kernel
- Peripherals
- Hypervisor

The issue is about the display not initializing. The user's BIOS might be assuming certain hardware that QEMU isn't providing, leading to a crash or infinite loop. This seems related to how the guest OS or BIOS interacts with the host's display device.

"Graphic" category would cover issues related to display output and initialization. Since the problem is about the display not being initialized, it likely falls under graphics-related problems.
