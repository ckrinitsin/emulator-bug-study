Alright, let's tackle this bug report classification step by step. The user is reporting an issue with QEMU where their system can't support a resolution of 1366x768. They mentioned using the `-vga vmware` and `-vga std` options without success.

First, I need to identify what aspect of QEMU this relates to. Since they're dealing with display resolution and VGA configuration, it's likely related to graphical output or VNC support. The categories provided include "graphic" and "vnc." 

The user didn't specify if they're using the VNC console directly, but since they mentioned `-vga`, which is about virtual graphic adapters, I'm leaning towards "graphic." However, sometimes VGA issues might relate to how QEMU handles display settings, which could fall under "other" if it's a configuration problem.

But considering that VGA configurations are part of the graphical output handling in QEMU, "graphic" seems more appropriate. Alternatively, if this is about VNC server settings, then "vnc" would be correct. However, since they're using `-vga` options with specific types (vmware and std), it's probably a limitation in how QEMU handles different VGA modes or resolutions.

Therefore, the most fitting category here is "graphic."

The bug report mentions issues with resolution when using the -vga option, which relates to graphical output. The appropriate category is:

**graphic**
