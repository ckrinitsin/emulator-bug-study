Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is reporting a problem with QEMU on Cocoa where a popup appears when trying to quit, and they can't disable it. This pop-up forces them to use the mouse every time because the default option is "Cancel." They find this very annoying, especially for their workflow of rapid Edit-Compile-Test cycles.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue described is about a UI popup when quitting QEMU. The Cocoa interface is graphical, so this relates to the graphical user interface aspect. It's not related to things like assembly or performance; it's more about how the application behaves on the GUI level.

I don't see any mention of network, socket, or hypervisor issues here. It's purely a UI problem when trying to quit the application. So the most fitting category is "graphic" because it involves the graphical interface elements causing an interruption during normal operation.
