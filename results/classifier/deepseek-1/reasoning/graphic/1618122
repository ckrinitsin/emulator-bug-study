Okay, I'm looking at this bug report about QEMU's qemu-monitor having a slow screendump. The user mentioned that it's using 10-20% CPU on one core even for small captures. They pointed out that most of the CPU usage comes from libpixman, which has been reported to be 8 times slower in newer releases. 

The Valgrind report shows high Ir numbers, mostly from libpixman functions like pixman_image_composite32 and memcpy operations. The user tried to figure out where the display buffer starts but couldn't find it easily. They suggested using the existing pixman_image_t structure to directly copy pixels into a PPM or BMP file without relying on libpixman, which they think would be more efficient.

The bug was marked as expired due to lack of recent activity, but if still valid, the user might want to reconsider.

Now, categorizing this. The issue is about the performance of the graphic-related functionality in QEMU's monitor. Since it's related to how graphics are handled and rendered, the appropriate category would be "graphic".
