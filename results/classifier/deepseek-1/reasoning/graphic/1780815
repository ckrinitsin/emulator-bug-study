Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about SDL not rescaling the image on resolution change in QEMU. Let's start by reading through the problem description carefully.

The user mentions that when in fullscreen mode, if the guest OS changes its resolution, the screen doesn't update properly. For example, going from 640x480 to 1024x768 results in only a part of the screen being displayed correctly, with the rest either blank or not updated. They also note that manually exiting fullscreen and re-entering fixes the issue, but it's a hassle every time the resolution changes.

Now, looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The problem is related to how the screen resizes when the guest's resolution changes. Since SDL is involved (as QEMU uses SDL for graphical output), it's likely a graphics-related issue. The bug affects the visual display, specifically the scaling and fullscreen mode handling.

(SDL is part of the graphical output handling in QEMU.) So the category should be 'graphic' because it deals with how images are displayed on the screen, especially when resolutions change. Other categories like device or peripherals don't fit as well because this isn't about hardware devices but rather the visual rendering.
