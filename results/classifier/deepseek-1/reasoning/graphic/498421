Okay, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is talking about an issue with QEMU where the emulated monitor EDID reports too few graphics resolutions in a Windows guest. They mention that the available modes are limited and suggest adding more resolutions like 1152x864, or even having finer granularity so users can adjust better.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem is related to graphics resolutions in a virtual machine. The user specifically mentions EDID reports from the monitor and the available modes, which points towards a graphics-related issue within QEMU's emulated hardware.

In the bug report, they also reference using `-vga std` or `-vga vmware`, which are parameters related to the graphical adapter configuration in QEMU. They mention that with these settings, there are more resolutions available, and even discuss the possibility of adding custom resolutions but note it's not user-friendly yet.

The categories I'm considering: graphic, device (since it's about hardware emulation), or maybe peripherals as it relates to input/output devices like a monitor. But 'graphic' seems the most specific here because it directly deals with the graphical output and resolution settings.

They also talk about EDID, which is part of how monitors communicate their capabilities. Since this is about emulating that correctly in QEMU's virtual environment, it's definitely related to the graphic category rather than other broader categories like 'device' or 'peripherals'.

So after considering all these points, I think the correct classification for this bug report is 'graphic'.

The issue revolves around graphics resolutions in a guest OS within QEMU. The problem relates to how the virtual monitor's EDID reports available resolutions and suggests enhancing the list of supported modes. Mentioning VGA configurations like `-vga std` or `-vga vmware`, which affect graphical capabilities, further points towards a 'graphic' category.
