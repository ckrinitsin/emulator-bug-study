Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the provided categories. The user mentioned that when running their program in QEMU, CGA Mode 6 only displays 100 pixels tall instead of the expected 200. This suggests an issue with how QEMU handles graphics or display modes.

Looking at the possible categories: graphic seems relevant here because it's about the visual output. Other options like network or kernel don't fit as this is specifically a display problem. The user also mentioned that the program works correctly on real hardware, indicating a potential bug in QEMU's emulation of CGA modes.

So, the category should be 'graphic' since it pertains to how the graphics mode is handled incorrectly in QEMU.

The issue relates to the incorrect handling of the CGA Mode 6 resolution in QEMU, which affects the graphical output. Therefore, the appropriate category is:

**graphic**
