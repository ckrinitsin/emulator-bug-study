Alright, I'm trying to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user mentioned that when Spice is enabled, QEMU doesn't display a graphical window and instead forces the use of -nographic. They think it should only set -display none without forcing nographic.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about how Spice interacts with display settings. The user wants to use Spice without forcing a non-graphical mode and mentions the VGA setup. This seems related to how QEMU handles graphical output when certain options are enabled.

Spice and VNC both affect the display configuration, but in this case, the problem is specifically about the graphical window not appearing as intended when using Spice. It's about display settings and UI behavior rather than translation errors or performance issues.

So, "graphic" seems like the most fitting category because it deals with how QEMU handles the graphical interface and display options.
