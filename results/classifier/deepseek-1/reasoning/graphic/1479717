Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report about QEMU. The user mentioned that auto-resizing the VM doesn't work with a Windows 10 guest but works fine with Windows 7. They're using Ubuntu as the host and have installed SPICE tools on the guest. 

First, looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about auto-resizing not working with Windows 10. The user also mentions flickering and scaling problems. They tried different tools like virt-manager, virt-viewer, remote-viewer, and Gnome Boxes. It seems related to how the display is handled, especially since it works for Linux guests but not Windows 10.

I'm thinking this might be a graphic issue because it's about the VM window resizing and screen flickering. The problem occurs when using Gnome Boxes, which suggests it could relate to how graphics are managed in that application. However, they mentioned that virt-viewer and remote-viewer work better after tweaking OVMF settings, pointing towards a deeper display configuration or driver issue.

The user also referenced issues with SPICE guest tools and virtio drivers not supporting Windows 10 properly. Since this is about graphical display handling within the VM, I think it's under the 'graphic' category.
