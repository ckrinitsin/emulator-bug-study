Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is experiencing an issue where there's no mouse cursor when using QXL with a Windows Seven guest under QEMU 2.4.1 and the SDL2 client. They mention that it works fine with Windows 8.1, so the problem seems specific to Windows Seven.

First, I need to look at the list of possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about the mouse cursor not appearing. The user mentions using QXL as the graphic card and SDL2 as the client. Since it's related to the display of the mouse cursor in a virtual machine, it likely has something to do with the graphical interface provided by QEMU.

QXL is part of the SPICE protocol support in QEMU/KVM for better 3D performance and graphical features. The fact that the mouse cursor isn't showing suggests there's an issue with how the graphics are being handled, possibly related to input devices or display rendering.

Looking at the categories, "graphic" seems the most relevant because it directly relates to the visual output of the VM. The problem is about the absence of a cursor, which ties into how QEMU handles mouse events and their display on the screen.

I don't think it's a device issue because the user didn't mention any problems with other hardware devices. It's more about the graphical display itself. Similarly, network or socket issues are unrelated here. The issue isn't about performance, permissions, or booting either.

So, considering all this, the most appropriate category is "graphic."
