Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is reporting an issue where running `qemu-kvm -curses` results in a garbled screen. They provided some details about their system and the versions they're using.

First, looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, etc. Since the problem occurs with the `-curses` option, which is related to display output, I'm thinking it's probably a graphics-related issue.

The user mentioned that even without a guest OS, there's garbled output. They tried different terminals and even a real terminal without X, but the issue persists. However, they noted that using the latest version of QEMU doesn't reproduce the problem anymore.

Given all this, the main issue seems to be with how QEMU handles the curses interface for display, which falls under the graphics category.
