Okay, let me try to wrap my head around this problem. So, from what I gather, the user is having trouble with two Chelsio NICs in their system when trying to set up virtual machines using Proxmox and QEMU/KVM. They applied a patch related to PCI vendor IDs, specifically for Chelsio (PCI_VENDOR_ID_CHELSIO = 0x1425), but they're still encountering boot errors on the VMs.

The user mentioned that both NICs are the same model, so I'm assuming they're using the same device IDs, probably 8100 or 8300. The patch was supposed to handle these devices, but it's not working as expected. They ran dmesg and didn't see any error messages related to the NICs, which is puzzling because the VM still fails.

They tried adding a quirk for function 7 of the device but found that it doesn't provide any valid BAR resources, making it unusable. The user also considered SR-IOV but decided against it because the process seems too involved and they're unsure if it would fix the issue.

In their discussion with upstream QEMU developers, they were told that the problem might be on Chelsio's side, possibly due to how function 7 is exposed or the need for SR-IOV. Since enabling SR-IOV isn't feasible anymore, they're stuck looking for another solution.

So, putting this together: The issue revolves around two identical Chelsio NICs causing boot failures in VMs despite applying a patch. Function 7 of these devices seems to be problematic because it doesn't provide valid resources, and without SR-IOV, there's no way to properly assign these functions to the VMs.

I think the next steps might involve:

1. **Checking for Updated Drivers**: Maybe the issue is with outdated drivers. The user should ensure that their Chelsio drivers are up to date. Sometimes vendor-specific issues get resolved in newer driver versions.

2. **Consulting Chelsio Support**: Since the problem seems to be related to how the hardware is exposed, contacting Chelsio's support might provide more insights. They could explain if function 7 should be used or if there's a configuration step needed on their end.

3. **Alternative Configuration in QEMU/KVM**: Perhaps there's another way to configure the VMs without relying on problematic functions. Maybe using different assignment methods or adjusting VM settings related to PCI passthrough.

4. **Exploring Workarounds**: If SR-IOV isn't an option, maybe there are other workarounds within Proxmox or QEMU that can bypass the issue with function 7.

5. **Looking for Similar Issues Online**: Sometimes others might have encountered similar problems. Checking forums, bug trackers, or community support sites could provide additional solutions or patches that have worked for others.

In summary, while the user has made progress by applying the patch and engaging with upstream developers, the core issue remains unresolved. Further investigation into driver updates, hardware configuration, and possible workarounds in QEMU/KVM seems necessary to resolve the boot failure problem.

The issue you're encountering is due to function 7 of your Chelsio NICs not providing valid resources (BARs), making it unusable for VM assignment. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Update Drivers**: Ensure your Chelsio drivers are up to date, as newer versions may resolve hardware-exposure issues.

2. **Disable Function 7**:
   - Use ` lspci -x` to identify the exact device and function.
   - Blacklist the problematic function using `echo "blacklist pci:v00001425d0000XXXXsv00000000sd000007bc" > /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-chelsio.conf` (replace XXXX with your device ID).
   - Reboot to apply changes.

3. **Consult Chelsio Support**: Contact Chelsio for insights on function 7 exposure or configuration needs.

4. **Alternative Configuration**:
   - In Proxmox, assign only the functional parts of the NICs (e.g., functions 0 and 1) to your VMs.
   - Avoid using function 7 entirely since it's non-functional.

5. **Workaround in QEMU/KVM**: If possible, configure your VMs without relying on function 7 by adjusting PCI passthrough settings or using alternative assignment methods.

6. **Community Resources**: Check online forums and bug trackers for similar issues and potential solutions or patches applied by others.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the boot failure issue in your VMs caused by the problematic function 7 of your Chelsio NICs.
