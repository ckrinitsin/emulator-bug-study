Okay, I need to classify this bug report regarding QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The user is experiencing abnormally slow performance when running Windows guests on their virtual machine using Gnome Boxes. They mentioned that they can't adjust the number of CPU cores allocated from the application's interface. This seems to be an issue with how resources are being managed or assigned in QEMU.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. Since the problem is about slow performance and resource allocation, I should think about what could cause that.

The user was instructed to provide the QEMU command-line parameters, which suggests it's related to how QEMU is being invoked. Issues with CPU cores might be linked to virtualization settings or hypervisor configuration. KVM is a key component for hardware-assisted virtualization in QEMU, so if it's not properly configured or if there's an issue with the number of vCPUs allocated, that could cause slowness.

The user also mentioned that they couldn't adjust cores from the UI, which might indicate a configuration problem in Gnome Boxes. However, since QEMU is the underlying hypervisor, any misconfiguration there would affect performance.

Since KVM directly relates to how virtual machines access CPU resources and virtualization, it's likely the category here. The user was also asked about KVM module loading, so that supports this thought.

I don't think it's a translation issue or graphics/network-related because the problem is generalized slowness without specific symptoms pointing to those areas. It seems more related to resource allocation under the hypervisor.
