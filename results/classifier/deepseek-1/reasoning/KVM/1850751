Alright, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me start by reading through the bug report carefully to understand what's being discussed.

The user mentioned that the kvm flag isn't exposed by default in QEMU. They pointed out that according to the source code, it should be exposed when using a X86CPU model. However, they have to explicitly add "kvm=on" in the custom CPU arguments. Additionally, libvirt can't expose the kvm flag because it assumes it's enabled by default, only allowing "kvm hidden='true'".

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue here is related to the KVM flag not being exposed by default. Since this directly pertains to the KVM functionality and its configuration within QEMU, the most appropriate category would be "KVM". The user is dealing with how QEMU handles KVM flags, which falls under the KVM category.

The bug report discusses issues related to the KVM flag exposure in QEMU. It's about whether the kvm flag is enabled by default and how it interacts with libvirt. Since this pertains directly to the KVM hypervisor feature, the appropriate category is "KVM".

**Answer:**
KVM
