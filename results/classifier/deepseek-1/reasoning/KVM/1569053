Alright, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is encountering an issue where QEMU crashes when starting a second VM. They provided the commands and the error log.

Looking at the problem description, the user is using KVM with multiple VMs. Each VM has its own chardev socket for vhost-user networking. When the second VM starts, QEMU crashes immediately with a "KVM internal error" and some hex values in the logs.

The key here is that it's happening when starting the second VM. The first one runs fine, but the second causes a crash. This suggests there might be an issue with how resources are being managed between multiple instances of KVM or perhaps a conflict in networking setup since each VM uses vhost-user sockets.

I notice that both VMs use similar configurations except for the socket paths and MAC addresses. The user is asking if both VMS connect to the same switch, implying possible network configuration issues.

Since the crash occurs within KVM when enabling the second VM, it points towards a problem related to the hypervisor or how QEMU/KVM handles multiple instances, possibly with resources like memory or I/O devices not being properly isolated or managed between the VMS.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. The crash is specific to starting another VM after one is already running and occurs within KVM itself. This makes me think it's a hypervisor-level issue rather than something related to devices, graphics, or networking configuration alone.

So, considering all this, the most fitting category would be "KVM" since the error message mentions "KVM internal error" and it's directly affecting the ability to run multiple VMs.

The bug report involves QEMU crashing when starting a second VM. The issue is related to KVM, as indicated by the "KVM internal error." This suggests a problem within the hypervisor itself rather than specific device configurations or networking.
