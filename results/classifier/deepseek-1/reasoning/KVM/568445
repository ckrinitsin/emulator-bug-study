Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the report carefully and understand what it's about.

The user is talking about KVM guests using LVM-backed drives experiencing high iowait times on the host system when there's moderate disk I/O. They mention that KVM defaults to writethrough caching, which causes poor performance. The suggestion is to explicitly disable caching for better performance.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. Since the issue is related to how KVM handles disk caching with LVM-backed drives, it's definitely about KVM behavior. It's not about graphics or networking; it's more about storage and I/O handling.

The user references upstream discussions on qemu-devel and other mailing lists, indicating that this is a configuration or default behavior in QEMU/KVM. The problem lies in the caching mode for block devices, which affects performance but not data integrity as both writethrough and none are considered safe according to the manpage.

So the bug report isn't about a crash or a specific feature request; it's more about adjusting defaults for better performance. However, the issue is tied to how KVM handles storage settings by default when using LVM, which falls under KVM's configuration and behavior.

Therefore, the appropriate category for this bug is "KVM."

The issue is related to the default caching mode in QEMU/KVM affecting performance with LVM-backed drives. Since it pertains to how KVM handles storage configurations by default, the correct classification is:

**KVM**
