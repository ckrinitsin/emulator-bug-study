Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The user is reporting that building QEMU 2.12.0 with GTK enabled fails on macOS 10.13.5 using Xcode 9.3. The error message points to a specific line in `ui/gtk.c` where an undeclared identifier `qemu_input_map_osx_to_qcode` is used, suggesting it's trying to reference a function or variable that isn't declared.

Looking at the code snippets, the user tried modifying the Makefile and `input.h` to include OSX keymap files. This indicates they were attempting to fix the missing declaration by adding the necessary components.

The error seems related to input handling, specifically how key mappings are processed on macOS. The function or variable `qemu_input_map_osx_to_qcode` is not declared in the included headers, leading to a build failure during compilation of the GTK UI component.

Considering the categories provided: device, graphic, network, etc. This issue pertains to input handling which falls under the 'peripherals' category since it's related to hardware devices (like keyboards and mice) interacting with QEMU.

The bug is related to an undeclared identifier in the input mapping for macOS, which affects the GTK build. This involves input handling for peripherals.

**Answer:** peripherals
