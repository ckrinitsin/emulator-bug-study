Okay, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is experiencing strange keyboard behavior specifically in Vim within a QEMU VM running MS-DOS. The arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn are affected, causing issues like moving over lines twice or not working correctly. Other applications aren't having the same problem unless they shell out from Vim.

Looking at the possible categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and others.

The issue is related to keyboard input in a virtual machine. Since it's about how QEMU handles keyboard events, especially considering that other hypervisors like VMware or Bochs don't exhibit this problem, it points towards an issue within QEMU's handling of hardware devices, specifically the keyboard emulation. 

In QEMU, the keyboard is typically emulated through the i8042 device, which might be where the patch mentioned (related to i8042.kbd-throttle) is applied. This suggests that the problem is with how the keyboard input is being processed or throttled in the virtual machine's hardware emulation.

Therefore, the category should relate to device handling, specifically the keyboard as a peripheral device. So the most appropriate category from the list would be "peripherals."
