Okay, I need to classify the bug report provided into one of the given categories. Let's look at the details.

The user is having trouble installing CentOS or Fedora on QEMU under Windows 8.1. The main issue is that their touchpad and USB mouse aren't recognized during installation. They tried adding the `-device usb-mouse` option but got an error about no 'usb-bus' found.

I remember that in QEMU, certain hardware devices require specific configurations. For example, to use USB devices, you need to enable the USB controller. The user might have forgotten to add the `-usb` option when running QEMU. Without this, even if they specify a USB device like the mouse, QEMU won't recognize it because there's no USB bus set up.

Looking at their commands, in the first one, they didn't include `-usb`, which could be why the devices aren't recognized. When they tried adding `-usb -device usb-mouse`, maybe that resolved the issue. The problem here is related to device configuration, specifically USB devices not being properly set up.

The categories given are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals.

Since this is about USB mouse and touchpad recognition, which fall under peripheral devices, the appropriate category should be 'peripherals'.

The bug report describes issues with USB devices not being recognized during QEMU installation. The solution involved enabling USB support by adding the `-usb` option, which relates to device configuration for peripherals.

**Answer:** peripherals
