Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user is experiencing issues with QEMU crashing when attaching USB 3.0 devices to an xHCI bus. They mentioned that using device_add to pass through a USB 3.0 memory stick causes QEMU to assert and crash. There were two different assertion errors: one from the xchi module regarding `intr->er_full` and another in core.c line 400 where `dev->state == 3` failed.

The user also tried working around by using an EHCI controller but faced issues where the USB 3.0 stick didn't work in Windows. They ensured that drivers were up to date and had to disable xHCI in their BIOS, resorting to EHCI for everything.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue revolves around USB devices and xHCI bus in QEMU. The problem occurs when attaching a USB 3.0 device to the xHCI bus, leading to a crash. Since this is related to handling USB devices through the hypervisor, which interacts with hardware (USB controllers) in the VM's peripherals, the appropriate category seems to be 'peripherals'.
