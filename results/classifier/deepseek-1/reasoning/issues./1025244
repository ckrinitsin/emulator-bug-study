Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why my qcow2 image file is growing so much. It's supposed to be around 30 GB but it's taking up over 600 GB with four snapshots. That seems way too big. Let me think about what could be causing this.

First, I remember that when you take a snapshot in QEMU/KVM, the virtual machine's image file (like the qcow2) can grow because each snapshot might save some data. But why is it growing so much? Maybe it's related to how snapshots are handled.

I saw someone mention that modifying the qcow2 file while the guest is running isn't safe and could cause inconsistencies. They suggested deleting the last backup snapshot when the VM is shut down, which worked for them. I tried that once and it reduced the image size by converting it again with qemu-img. That process detects unused sectors and trims them, so maybe that helps.

But after some time, the machine starts growing again, needing another 1 TB drive just to free up space temporarily. It feels like a workaround rather than a real solution.

Another thing I read was about using HMP commands or QMP to delete snapshots from within the running VM instead of modifying the file externally. That way, QEMU knows about the changes and doesn't get confused about the next free cluster index. Maybe that's more reliable but requires some setup.

I'm not entirely sure if I understand how the snapshots work with the qcow2 file. Each snapshot might create a new layer or copy data in a way that isn't properly freed when you delete them, especially if done incorrectly while the VM is running.

I also wonder if there's an issue with how QEMU handles the free space after deleting snapshots. Maybe it doesn't compact the image correctly unless I convert it again, which is why the size grows back over time as more data is written without being properly trimmed.

Looking into external snapshots might help because they don't modify the main qcow2 file but store changes in separate files. But I'm not sure how to set those up or if there are any issues with compatibility or performance.

I should probably check what version of QEMU/KVM I'm using and see if it supports external snapshots properly. Maybe newer versions have better handling, so upgrading could resolve some issues. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that I'm relying on internal snapshots which aren't designed to be deleted safely while the VM is running.

To sum up, my main issue seems to be that the qcow2 file isn't releasing unused space after snapshots are deleted, possibly because of how QEMU manages cluster indices and free space. The workaround is deleting snapshots when the VM is off and converting the image to compact it. However, this only gives temporary relief.

I think I need to look into using external snapshots or find a way to ensure that when I delete snapshots, QEMU properly updates its internal state without needing to manually intervene each time. Alternatively, maybe there's a configuration or command-line option I can use to make QEMU handle this more efficiently.

To address the issue of an overgrown qcow2 image file despite deleting snapshots and converting it, consider the following structured approach:

1. **Understanding Snapshot Handling**: Internal snapshots in QEMU/KVM can lead to increased image size due to how they manage data layers. Deleting these while the VM is running may not be safe, potentially causing inconsistencies.

2. **Workaround with Shutdown Mode**: Delete snapshots when the VM is powered off. This ensures that QEMU's internal state is correctly updated without risking inconsistencies. After deletion, convert the qcow2 image using `qemu-img` to compact it by removing unused sectors.

3. **Consider External Snapshots**: Migrate to external snapshots if possible, as they store changes in separate files, preventing unnecessary growth of the base qcow2 file. This method is more efficient and avoids issues with internal snapshot management.

4. **QEMU Version Update**: Ensure you are using a recent version of QEMU/KVM that supports newer features like HMP/QMP commands for snapshot management and external snapshots. Upgrading might resolve existing bugs or improve handling of snapshots.

5. **Using Monitor Commands**: Utilize HMP (HumanMonitorProtocol) or QMP (Query Management Protocol) commands to delete snapshots from within the running VM. This approach keeps QEMU informed, preventing issues with cluster indices and free space management.

6. **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically check the qcow2 image size and perform `qemu-img compact` if necessary. Monitor guest OS behavior to ensure it discards unused sectors, which can help QEMU recognize free space more effectively.

By implementing these steps, you can manage the qcow2 file growth more efficiently, reducing reliance on temporary workarounds and potentially eliminating recurring issues.
