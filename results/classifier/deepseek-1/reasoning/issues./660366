Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU. Let's start by reading through the problem description carefully.

The user reports an issue where using `qemu-img convert -O qcow2 -o backing_file=1.img 2.img 3.img` results in a larger image (3.img) than expected. They mention that the resulting image is bigger than the source, which seems counterintuitive.

From their example, 1.img is about 4MB, and when they create 2.img using `qemu-img create`, it's only 144KB. But when they convert again to make 3.img with the same backing file option, it ends up being 4.3MB, which is larger than both source images. 

They expect that the resulting image should only contain data not present in the backing file. So if the backing file (2.img) already has most of the data from 1.img, 3.img shouldn't be so large. But instead, it's including all the data again, making it bigger than necessary.

The user also suggests a workaround involving creating another image with chained backing files and proposes adding a deduplication feature to commit changes without duplication. They confirmed that Anthony Liguori has already classified this as a confirmed bug in QEMU.

Now, looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, other. 

The issue is related to how QEMU handles backing files during image conversion. The problem seems to be in the way QEMU creates new images and references the backing file's data. It doesn't deduplicate or reference existing data efficiently, leading to larger than expected images.

This isn't an assembly lowering issue (like assembly code translation) nor is it related to networking, graphics, or other low-level hardware interactions. The problem lies in how QEMU manages image files and their references, which is more about the filesystem and storage handling.

Looking at the possible categories again, 'files' seems appropriate because it's dealing with file operations (qemu-img commands) and how data is stored across files. Alternatively, 'performance' might be considered since the resulting images are larger than expected, affecting efficiency, but the primary issue is in file handling and references.

However, the main problem here is that when using `qemu-img convert` with a backing file option, it's not efficiently utilizing the existing data from the backing image. Instead of creating a sparse image that only includes new data, it's duplicating all the data, which is a storage/file issue rather than a performance bottleneck.

Therefore, 'files' seems to be the most fitting category because it relates directly to how QEMU manages and references files during image conversion.

The classification for this bug report is:

**Files**

This category is appropriate because the issue revolves around how QEMU handles file operations and references when creating images with backing files. The problem lies in efficient data storage and referencing rather than performance or other hardware-related issues.
