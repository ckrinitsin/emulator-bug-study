Alright, I need to figure out how to approach this problem with the KVM guests on Ubuntu 18.04 using PowerPC. The user mentioned that they can't boot an Ubuntu 14.04.5 guest in Power8 compatibility mode on a Boston P9 DD2.2 system. They also provided some context about changes made in the kernel related to KVM and PPC, specifically allowing HPT and radix on the same core for POWER9 v2.2.

First, I should understand what each part of this means. KVM is a virtualization technology that allows running guest operating systems as virtual machines. On PowerPC systems, there are different modes like HPT (hashed page tables) and radix (another form of page table). For compatibility with older POWER8 guests on newer POWER9 hardware, the system needs to handle both HPT and radix correctly.

The user's issue is that when trying to boot an Ubuntu 14.04.5 guest in Power8 mode on a P9 system, it fails. They applied a kernel patch that allows both HPT and radix on the same core for POWER9 v2.2. I need to test whether this fix works.

I should start by setting up the environment. Since I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) as the host, I'll enable the -proposed kernel to include the necessary patches. Then, I'll set up KVM and try to launch a PowerPC guest in compatibility mode.

Here's what I need to do step by step:

1. **Enable the Proposed Kernel**: In Ubuntu, to test the proposed packages, I can add the `ubuntu-proposed` repository and update my system. This way, when I install the kernel from -proposed, it includes the latest fixes.

   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository proposed
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install the Updated Kernel**: Install the new kernel package. It's usually named something like `linux-image-generic` with a version indicating it's from -proposed.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install linux-image-generic/ubuntu-proposed
   ```

3. **Reboot into the New Kernel**: After installation, reboot the system to use the new kernel.

4. **Set Up KVM for PowerPC Guests**: Ensure that I have the necessary QEMU and KVM tools installed. On Ubuntu, this typically includes packages like `qemu-system-powerpc64le` or similar, depending on the architecture.

5. **Prepare the Guest Image**: Create or obtain an Ubuntu 14.04.5 ISO image suitable for a PowerPC guest. Make sure it's compatible with KVM and that the system can boot from it.

6. **Launch the KVM VM in Compatibility Mode**:

   I'll use the following QEMU command to launch the guest:

   ```bash
   qemu-system-powerpc64le \
       -M pseries-v2.0 \
       -cpu POWER9,compat=power8 \
       -m 1024M \
       -smp 1,cores=1 \
       -drive if=pflash,driver=raw,file.driver=stdio,format=raw, file.filename=openpowerkvm-ppc64le-boot.iso \
       -net none \
       -nographic
   ```

   Here, I specify the machine type `pseries-v2.0`, set the CPU to POWER9 with compatibility mode for POWER8, allocate 1GB of RAM and one core, and attach the guest ISO as a pflash drive.

7. **Observe Boot Behavior**: After starting the VM, check if the guest OS (Ubuntu 14.04.5) boots successfully. If it doesn't, look for any error messages during the boot process that might indicate issues with hardware initialization or virtualization support.

8. **Check Kernel Logs on Host**: If the guest fails to boot, inspect the host's kernel logs to see if there are any relevant errors or warnings related to KVM or PPC operations.

   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i kvm
   ```

9. **Verify HPT and Radix Configuration**: Since the fix allows both HPT and radix on the same core, I should check whether the kernel is correctly handling this configuration when running a Power8 guest on POWER9 hardware.

10. **Reproduce the Issue Without the Fix**: To ensure that the problem has been fixed, it might help to test without the proposed kernel as well, but since the fix is already applied, this might not be necessary unless I suspect other factors are at play.

11. **Log Any Errors or Output**: If the guest fails to boot, capture the output from QEMU and any relevant logs to provide more context for troubleshooting.

Potential issues to consider:

- **Kernel Module Support**: Ensure that all necessary kernel modules for KVM and PowerPC virtualization are loaded on the host.
  
  ```bash
  lsmod | grep kvm
  ```

- **BIOS/UEFI Settings**: Sometimes, hardware virtualization settings need to be enabled in the BIOS. On some systems, you might need to enable "Nested Virtualization" or similar features.

- **Guest OS Compatibility**: Ensure that the guest OS is properly configured to run under KVM and supports the necessary virtualization extensions.

- **HWMPTE (Hardware Multi-TLB Page Table Extension)**: Since HPT relates to TLB management, any issues here could cause boot failures. The kernel should handle this correctly with the applied patch.

After performing these steps, if the guest still doesn't boot, I might need to look into more detailed debugging or consult additional resources on PowerPC virtualization configurations.

To address the issue of booting an Ubuntu 14.04.5 PowerPC guest in compatibility mode on a P9 system, follow these structured steps:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Enable Proposed Kernel Repository:**
   Add the proposed repository to access the latest kernel updates.

   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository proposed
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install Updated Kernel:**
   Install the new kernel package from the proposed repositories.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install linux-image-generic/ubuntu-proposed
   ```

3. **Reboot System:**
   Reboot to apply the new kernel.

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

4. **Set Up KVM Environment:**
   Ensure QEMU and KVM tools are installed.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install qemu-system-powerpc64le
   ```

5. **Prepare Guest ISO:**
   Obtain an Ubuntu 14.04.5 ISO suitable for PowerPC guests.

6. **Launch the KVM VM:**
   Use QEMU with compatibility mode enabled.

   ```bash
   qemu-system-powerpc64le \
       -M pseries-v2.0 \
       -cpu POWER9,compat=power8 \
       -m 1024M \
       -smp 1,cores=1 \
       -drive if=pflash,driver=raw,file.driver=stdio,format=raw,file.filename=/path/to/guest.iso \
       -net none \
       -nographic
   ```

7. **Monitor Guest Boot:**
   Observe the boot process for any errors.

8. **Check Host Logs:**
   Inspect kernel logs for KVM-related issues.

   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i kvm
   ```

9. **Verify HPT and Radix Configuration:**
   Ensure both modes are supported on POWER9 hardware.

10. **Troubleshooting Tips:**
    - Check loaded modules with `lsmod | grep kvm`.
    - Ensure BIOS settings allow nested virtualization.
    - Capture QEMU output for detailed debugging.

By following these steps, you can test whether the kernel fix resolves the boot issue. If successful, the guest should boot into Ubuntu 14.04.5 without errors.
