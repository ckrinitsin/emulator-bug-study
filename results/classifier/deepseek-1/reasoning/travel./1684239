Okay, let me try to understand what's going on here. The user is talking about using QEMU with a vfat image and encountering some issues. They mentioned creating an empty QCOW2 image called bering-own.qcow2 and then trying two different methods: mounting it as vvfat in the guest versus passing the qcow file directly.

From what I know, QEMU's vfat driver is quite limited and isn't recommended for use as a root filesystem. It's more of a quick fix for specific cases, like when you need to share files between the host and a VM using a FAT-formatted image. Using it for anything critical or complex can lead to issues because of its limitations.

The user also referenced some bug reports and patches in their message. They mentioned that a particular bug was fixed in QEMU version 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.13, specifically fixing an assertion issue in vvfat when used in read-write mode. That makes me think they were having problems with how the vfat image was being handled, maybe related to file operations or mounting.

They also talked about opening a new bug for another issue but agreed that using vfat should be done cautiously because it's still buggy. They closed this particular bug after verifying the fix and thanked the team involved.

So, putting this together, it seems like they were having trouble with QEMU's vfat driver when trying to use a QCOW2 image in two different ways: mounting it as vvfat versus passing it directly as a drive. The issue was resolved with a specific patch in QEMU, and they plan to address other unrelated bugs separately.

I should make sure my summary reflects their understanding of the problem and the resolution steps, while also noting the caution regarding vfat's usage.

The user is discussing an issue related to using QEMU's `vvfat` driver with a QCOW2 image. They explored two methods:

1. **Mounting the QCOW2 image as a vvfat filesystem** within the guest VM and accessing it from there.
2. **Passing the QCOW2 file directly** as a drive to the guest.

The user acknowledges that these are fundamentally different approaches and highlights warnings against using `vvfat` for critical tasks, such as non-ASCII filenames or while writing to the FAT directory during guest access. They reference specific bugs and patches, noting that the issue was fixed in QEMU version 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.13.

The user confirms the bug is resolved but advises caution when using `vvfat` due to its limitations. They plan to address other unrelated issues separately and close this one after verifying the fix.

**Summary of Key Points:**
- **Issue:** Problems with using a QCOW2 image via vvfat in QEMU.
- **Fixes Applied:** Bug fixes implemented in QEMU version 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.13.
- **Advice:** Use vvfat cautiously, as it's not recommended for critical tasks.

The user thanks the team and notes they'll install the update upon return from travel.
