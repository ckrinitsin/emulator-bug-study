Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why my build process is getting stuck. Let me start by looking at the information provided.

First, there's some output about a filesystem. It mentions "Filesystem magic number: 0xEF53" and other features like ext4 with journaling, ext_attr, etc. The state is clean, so that part seems fine. Maybe not related to the build issue.

Then, looking at the build getting stuck on certain system calls:

- clock_gettime
- getdents64
- lseek
- tgkill

The error message says "tgkill(29974, 29977, SIGRT_2) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)". That's interesting. So the issue is with the tgkill system call returning EAGAIN, which means the resource isn't available right now.

I read that a user suggested using a 32-bit QEMU binary instead of 64-bit to avoid this problem. They mentioned that running a 32-bit qemu-arm-static allows the host kernel to switch to 32-bit compatibility mode, which might resolve the issue because some applications have trouble with 64-bit environments.

Another point they made is about using multilib to run 32-bit binaries on a 64-bit system. They tested this with SVN and found that checkouts worked after switching to a 32-bit QEMU process.

They also mentioned that running in a tmpfs showed similar issues, but when the root was copied onto btrfs, it worked fine. That suggests filesystem or disk type might affect the problem's occurrence.

The discussion then shifts to kernel APIs and patches by Linus Walleij for ext4 support, which didn't get merged yet. The issue is being moved to QEMU's new bug tracker on GitLab as expired unless reopened.

So putting this together: The build is getting stuck because of a system call failure when using 64-bit QEMU. Switching to 32-bit QEMU might work around the problem since it uses host's compatibility mode, which could handle directory entries differently.

I think the main solution here is to switch the QEMU process to use 32 bits if possible. If that's not feasible, maybe looking into filesystem configurations or kernel patches would be next steps.

The issue arises due to a system call failure when using a 64-bit QEMU process. The suggested workaround is to run a 32-bit QEMU binary, which allows the host kernel to switch to 32-bit compatibility mode, potentially resolving directory handling issues.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Problem Identification**: Build process hangs due to an `tgkill` system call returning EAGAIN.
2. **Suggested Workaround**: Use a 32-bit QEMU binary (qemu-arm-static) on a 64-bit host.
3. **How It Helps**: The host kernel switches to 32-bit mode, avoiding compatibility issues with certain applications or filesystem operations.
4. **Testing**: Confirmed effective with SVN checkouts; tmpfs may have similar issues while btrfs works better.

**Solution:**

- Use a 32-bit QEMU binary (e.g., `qemu-arm-static`) to run your build environment. This can mitigate the issue by leveraging the host's compatibility mode for 32-bit processes, allowing proper handling of directory operations and preventing the hang during the build process.

**Answer:**
The build issue is caused by a system call conflict when using a 64-bit QEMU. To resolve it, run your build with a 32-bit QEMU binary to utilize the host's compatibility mode, which should prevent the hang.
