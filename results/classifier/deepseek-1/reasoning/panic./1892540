Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. So, there was a problem with the QEMU code related to the TCX blitter MemoryRegion after a previous commit. The issue is that enabling 64-bit accesses for the framebuffer stippler and blitter missed one of the blitter's MemoryRegions, causing a panic in the latest NetBSD ISO during startup.

Looking at the provided patch, it seems that the `tcx_blit_ops` structure had its `.valid` field set to allow only 32-bit access (min and max as 4), but after the commit, another part of the code was updated. However, this particular MemoryRegion wasn't adjusted, leading to an inconsistency.

The fix involves modifying the `.impl` field in `tcx_blit_ops` from having a min and max access size of 4 to instead use `.valid` with a min of 4 and a max of 8. This would allow both 32-bit and 64-bit accesses for that specific MemoryRegion.

I need to make sure this change is correctly applied so that all blitter operations can handle the necessary memory accesses without causing a panic in NetBSD.

The issue has been resolved with the application of the patch, ensuring that the TCX blitter's MemoryRegion now supports 64-bit accesses. This prevents the panic during the NetBSD ISO startup.

**Answer:**
The bug was fixed by updating the `tcx_blit_ops` structure to allow 64-bit access for the blitter MemoryRegion, ensuring proper functionality without causing a panic.
