Okay, I'm trying to help someone who's having trouble converting a Qcow2 image to VMDK using qemu-img. They followed specific steps but ended up with boot errors in multiple hypervisors. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, they created a Debian 10 base image using Packer. That seems fine since it boots correctly in Virt-manager. Then they converted it to VMDK with the command including streamOptimized subformat and lsilogic adapter. But when they used this vmdk in VMs under ESXi, VirtualBox, or Virt-manager (with SCSI), it failed with disk read errors.

Looking at their qemu-img command: "qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O vmdk -o adapter_type=lsilogic,subformat=streamOptimized,hwversion=6 base.qcow2 base.vmdk". The output descriptor shows version 1 and streamOptimized format. Without the subformat, it works but is larger.

I know that streamOptimized is a sparse format optimized for streaming in VMware. Maybe there's an issue with how the vmdk is being created or how the hypervisors handle it. Let me check if they're using compatible options.

Wait, the user mentioned setting hwversion=6. But I think in newer versions of qemu-img, some parameters might have changed. Also, when converting to VMDK, sometimes additional flags are needed for compatibility with certain VMware versions or configurations.

Another thought: Maybe the base image's disk geometry isn't compatible with how the vmdk is being created. The descriptor shows a specific number of cylinders, heads, and sectors. If that doesn't match what the hypervisor expects, it could cause boot issues.

Also, they tried using different adapters (SCSI in some cases). Maybe the adapter type specified in the conversion isn't compatible with all hypervisors. They used lsiLogic, but perhaps other adapters like Buslogic or others might be needed, depending on where they're running.

I should look up if there are known issues with converting qcow2 to vmdk using streamOptimized subformat and whether this causes boot problems in VMware environments. Maybe there's a qemu bug related to this.

They tried removing the streamOptimized flag and it worked, but the image was larger. So perhaps the issue is indeed with the streamOptimized format not being handled correctly in their setup.

I remember that some versions of QEMU had issues with VMDK creation, especially regarding geometry information. Maybe they need to specify additional parameters like 'physicalHW' or adjust other settings during conversion.

Alternatively, maybe using a different subformat without streamOptimized is the only reliable way for them until they can find a solution that works with their hypervisors.

The issue arises when converting a Qcow2 image to VMDK using streamOptimized format, which causes boot errors in VMware environments. This might be due to compatibility issues or bugs in the conversion process. To resolve this:

1. **Use a Different Subformat**: Convert without specifying `streamOptimized`, though it results in a larger file.
   ```bash
   qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O vmdk -o adapter_type=lsilogic,hwversion=6 base.qcow2 base.vmdk
   ```

2. **Check Geometry Compatibility**: Ensure the disk geometry (cylinders, heads, sectors) matches what hypervisors expect.

3. **Update QEMU Version**: Use the latest version to benefit from bug fixes related to VMDK conversions.

4. **Alternative Tools**: Consider using other tools like `vmkfstools` for conversion if issues persist.

By avoiding the streamOptimized subformat, you can ensure compatibility across hypervisors, even if the image size increases.
