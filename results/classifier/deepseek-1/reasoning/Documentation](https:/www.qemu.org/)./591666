Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is reporting an issue with QEMU where using the "pci_add auto storage" command doesn't add the device to the guest OS. They provided a lot of details about their setup, including kernel versions and commands they ran.

First, I see that they're using the pci_add command in the QEMU monitor. However, from what I remember, QEMU has deprecated or removed some commands over time. In this case, the user mentions that "pci_add" was removed since version 2.3.0. So if they're running a newer version of QEMU, this command wouldn't work anymore.

Looking at the error message, it suggests closing the bug because the command is no longer supported. But just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's another way to add PCI devices in newer versions of QEMU. Perhaps through different commands or configuration files.

The user also tried using libvirt and encountered some version issues with virsh. That might be a separate problem related to their environment setup rather than the QEMU bug they're reporting.

In summary, since the command is deprecated, this issue falls under QEMU's command-line tools changes. The classification should reflect that it's about the removal of an outdated feature.

The issue described involves the use of the `pci_add` command in QEMU, which has been deprecated and removed in versions 2.3.0 and later. This change affects how users interact with virtualized devices within QEMU.

**Classification:**  
- **Feature Removal/Deprecation**: The removal of the `pci_add` command in newer versions of QEMU.
- **Environment/Snapshot**: As this issue pertains to deprecated functionality, it is no longer applicable in current QEMU releases unless users are specifically working with older versions.

If you encounter similar issues, ensure you're using compatible commands and features for your version of QEMU. For the latest support, refer to the [QEMU Documentation](https://www.qemu.org/).
