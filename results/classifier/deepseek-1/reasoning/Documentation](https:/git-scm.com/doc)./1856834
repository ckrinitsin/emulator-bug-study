Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to revert a previous commit on top of master in Git. I'm new to this, so I need to take it step by step. First, I remember that when you want to undo changes in Git, there are a few commands you can use. One is `git reset`, and another is `git revert`. But I'm not entirely sure which one does what.

I think `git revert` creates a new commit that undoes the previous change, right? So if I have a commit that's causing issues, using `git revert <commit-hash>` would let me undo it without deleting history. That might be useful in some cases, especially if I want to keep track of why I reverted something.

On the other hand, `git reset` seems more about moving the branch pointer back. If I use `git reset --hard`, it resets both the working directory and the index, discarding any uncommitted changes. But this would also move the branch pointer, which might not be what I want if I'm on master and just need to get rid of a bad commit.

Wait, in my case, I have some commits after the problematic one that I don't want to lose. So maybe `git revert` is better because it doesn't alter the history beyond adding a new commit that undoes the changes.

Another thing I'm unsure about is how exactly to apply this on top of master. Do I need to merge or rebase? If I use `git revert`, do I just run it in my current branch, which should be based on master?

I also came across the term "bisect" for finding out at which commit something breaks. I think it's a tool that helps narrow down when an issue was introduced by testing each commit between two points. But the user mentioned they aren't advanced kernel gurus, so maybe there's a simpler way to walk through steps.

I'm also dealing with QEMU and VirtIO devices in my setup. It sounds like the problem is related to the number of PCI slots in the MPC8544DS board simulation. The original code only defines two slots, but when more devices are added, it causes issues because the DTB doesn't have enough entries. So, either increasing the number of slots or adding a bridge might fix this.

The user tried reverting the patch and it didn't work, so maybe the issue is deeper than just that commit. It seems like modifying `pci_nr_slots` to 4 works as a quick fix, but it's not realistic for actual hardware. A better approach would be to add a PCI-PCI bridge device, which allows more slots without changing the hardware simulation.

Additionally, there were problems with MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts) not working correctly on e500mc CPUs. Disabling MSI or setting vectors=0 for VirtIO devices resolved the issue by using legacy interrupts instead.

I'm a bit confused about how all these pieces fit together. It seems like the main problem is the limited PCI slots causing device probing issues, and fixing that could resolve the kernel freezes related to VirtIO devices.

The user mentioned that they couldn't make Linux boot on older versions of QEMU beyond 2.4.1, which suggests that this might be a known issue for some time. But without active reports or updates, the bug was marked as incomplete, so maybe it's not being addressed currently.

In summary, I need to figure out how to properly revert a commit in Git and possibly use bisect to identify problematic commits. For the QEMU issue, adjusting the simulation parameters or adding bridges might be necessary. Since I'm new, I should probably start by learning the basic Git commands for reverting changes and then apply them step by step.

To address the issues mentioned:

1. **Reverting a Commit in Git:**
   - Use `git revert <commit-hash>` to create a new commit that undoes the changes made by the specified commit without altering the history of other commits.

2. **Using Bisect for Identifying Problematic Commits:**
   - To identify when an issue was introduced, use `git bisect` to narrow down the range of commits between two known states (one working, one broken). This involves:
     - Initializing bisect with `git bisect start`.
     - Marking bad and good commits as you test.
     - Using `git bisect run` to automate testing for specific conditions.

3. **Fixing QEMU Issues:**
   - Increase the number of PCI slots in `hw/ppc/mpc8544ds.c` by modifying `pci_nr_slots`.
   - Alternatively, add a PCI-PCI bridge to simulate more devices without changing hardware parameters.
   - For VirtIO issues with MSI, disable MSI or set `vectors=0` to use legacy interrupts.
