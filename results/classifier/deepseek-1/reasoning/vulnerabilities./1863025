Okay, let's try to break this down. I'm not very familiar with QEMU or security vulnerabilities, but I'll do my best to understand what's going on here.

So, there was a CVE assigned, CVE-2020-24165. From the email, it looks like someone named Samuel Henrique mentioned that this CVE was assigned and provided a link to the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) detail page. He also linked directly to the CVE entry on Mitre's site.

Then, Daniel P. Berrangé responded. He mentioned that QEMU 4.2.0 was released in 2019, which is older than I thought. The issue Samuel referred to has been fixed in a commit called 886cc68943, which was part of QEMU v5.0 released in April 2020. That's over three years ago.

Daniel seems confused about why assign a CVE now for such old code. He asked what they expect them to do here and questioned whether assigning a CVE after so long is useful.

He also brought up the QEMU security policy, pointing out that TCG isn't considered a security boundary between host and guest. So bugs in TCG aren't treated as security flaws. The link he provided goes to the QEMU docs section on security, specifically non-virtualization use cases. I'm guessing that means if TCG is used for things like debugging or when virtualization isn't enabled, then it's not seen as a secure environment.

Then, Mauro Matteo Cascella from Red Hat Product Security chimed in. He mentioned another CVE, 2022-36648, which he also disputed and filed issues with Mitre. It seems like both these CVEs are confusing him because they were assigned but he doesn't see them as valid security issues.

Putting this together: someone assigned a CVE to an issue in QEMU that was already fixed three years ago. The project maintainers don't consider TCG-related bugs as security flaws, so they think assigning a CVE is unnecessary and perhaps even incorrect. Mauro is part of the product security team at Red Hat and is disputing these CVE assignments, possibly because they don't meet the criteria for being security vulnerabilities.

I'm not sure why NVD or Mitre would assign CVEs to issues that were already fixed so long ago and aren't considered security flaws by the project itself. Maybe there was a misunderstanding of how QEMU handles TCG or what constitutes a security boundary. Alternatively, perhaps the person who assigned the CVE thought it was still relevant without checking if it had been fixed.

Daniel's stance is clear: they don't treat these as security issues, so they're not obligated to do anything further. But Mauro is trying to get them removed by disputing through Mitre's form. It might be a case where the CVE assigner didn't fully understand QEMU's architecture or policies, leading to incorrect assignments.

I wonder what the process is for disputing CVEs. If Mitre accepts these disputes, they might remove the CVEs from their database. But until then, the issue remains, which could cause confusion among users and other security professionals who rely on CVEs as a trusted source of vulnerabilities.

Also, thinking about the timeline: QEMU 4.2 was released in 2019, fixed in v5.0 in April 2020. Assigning a CVE in 2020 for that issue makes sense at the time, but assigning it again or considering it now doesn't seem right. Unless there's a new version where this issue resurfaced, which isn't mentioned here.

Another angle is whether the fix was properly backported to older versions of QEMU. If not, maybe some users are still vulnerable. But since v5.0 was released in April 2020, and it's been almost four years, most users should have upgraded by now, especially given that newer versions would include this fix.

I'm also curious about the rating of CVE-2022-36648 as Critical. If QEMU's security team doesn't consider TCG bugs as security flaws, then maybe the severity was overrated. Perhaps the person who rated it didn't understand the context or the project's policies regarding TCG.

In summary, this seems like a case of a CVE being assigned to an issue that wasn't considered a security flaw by the project maintainers, possibly due to a misunderstanding of QEMU's architecture and its use of TCG. The maintainers are pointing out that since it was fixed over three years ago, assigning a CVE now isn't helpful, and they're disputing the assignments through Mitre.

The discussion revolves around the assignment of two CVEs (CVE-2020-24165 and CVE-2022-36648) to QEMU issues that were addressed in an older version. Here's a structured summary:

1. **Context**:
   - **QEMU 4.2.0** was released in 2019, with the issue in question fixed in **QEMU v5.0** (April 2020).
   - The project maintainers do not consider TCG-related bugs as security flaws due to their use case and architecture.

2. **CVE Assignments**:
   - **CVE-2020-24165**: Assigned to an issue that was already resolved, leading to confusion about its relevance.
   - **CVE-2022-36648**: Rated as Critical but disputed by maintainers due to their policy on TCG.

3. **Maintainers' Perspective**:
   - Daniel P. Berrangé questions the utility of assigning CVEs to issues from three years ago, especially since they don't consider such bugs security flaws.
   - The issue is likely a misunderstanding of QEMU's architecture and policies by the assigner.

4. **Dispute Process**:
   - Mauro Matteo Cascella from Red Hat is disputing these CVEs with Mitre, potentially leading to their removal if accepted.

5. **Implications**:
   - The situation highlights the importance of understanding project-specific security policies before assigning CVEs.
   - Proper backporting of fixes ensures most users are no longer vulnerable, given the time since v5.0's release.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The likely cause is a misunderstanding of QEMU's architecture and policies by the CVE assigner, leading to unnecessary and incorrect assignments.

In essence, this case underscores the need for thorough understanding of software project specifics before identifying and rating security vulnerabilities.
