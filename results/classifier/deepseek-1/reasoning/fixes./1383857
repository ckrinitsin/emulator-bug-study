Okay, so the user is trying to create a guest with virtio-scsi disks using QEMU and it's not showing up inside the guest. They mentioned that after loading the virtio_mmio.ko and virtio_scsi.ko modules, there are no messages about disks, so nothing works.

I know that VirtIO is an I/O virtualization technology designed to allow efficient communication between a hypervisor (like KVM) and guest operating systems. The user provided a long command line generated by libvirt, which includes various QEMU options, devices, and drives.

Looking at the command line, they're using virtio-scsi-device and scsi-hd for disks. It seems like the disks are set up correctly in QEMU's configuration. However, the guest isn't seeing them. The user also mentioned that it worked with kernel 3.16 but not anymore, so maybe a regression happened.

I wonder if there were changes in the way VirtIO or SCSI devices are handled in the newer kernel versions. Perhaps the modules aren't being loaded correctly, or the guest's SCSI subsystem isn't detecting them properly.

The user suspects it might be a kernel bug rather than QEMU. They mentioned trying to figure out where to report such bugs but thought we fixed it. I recall that this issue was reported as a bug (bug #1383857) in QEMU, and it's been marked as fixed. So the conclusion is that the problem has already been resolved.

I should inform the user that their assumption is correctâ€”this issue has indeed been fixed. If they're encountering similar problems now, suggesting checking for updates or reapplying patches might be helpful.

The issue described in the query regarding virtio-scsi disks not being recognized in a QEMU guest was addressed and resolved as indicated by the user's follow-up. This suggests that the problem has been fixed through appropriate debugging or updates.

**Answer:**

Yes, the issue has been resolved. If you're encountering similar problems, ensure your system is up-to-date with the latest patches or versions to benefit from these fixes.
