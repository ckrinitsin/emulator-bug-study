Alright, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report is about "wrong error for blockdev-snapshot-sync." The user provided code snippets where they noticed an issue with the error message. They explain that when a snapshot file exists and bdrv_find_protocol() fails, it incorrectly refers to "format" instead of "scheme."

Looking at the categories, "blockdev-snapshot-sync" relates to handling block devices and snapshots. Block devices fall under storage or filesystem operations. Among the provided categories, the most fitting one would be 'files' because it's dealing with file-related errors in block device management.

So, the category should be 'files.'
