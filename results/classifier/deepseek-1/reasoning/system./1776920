Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the conv_mac_v4_0mit_S0.vmdk file isn't working. The user mentioned that they created it on a Mac using APFS with the -S 0 option, but it doesn't work. However, when converting on a non-Mac system, like CentOS with QEMU-img version 1.5.3, it works fine and is bootable.

First, I'm a bit confused about what exactly is meant by "-S 0". From my understanding, in QEMU, the -S option is used to skip certain sectors during image conversion. Maybe -S 0 means skipping sector 0 or something related to that. But it didn't fix the issue for the user on Mac.

The user also mentioned that they tried Yan-Jie Wang's patch from issue #20 but couldn't include it because it wasn't signed off yet. I'm not sure if this patch is relevant anymore since QEMU might have moved on, or maybe the bug was already fixed in a newer version.

Then, the user provided some steps they followed to test, and those worked for them. They used dd commands to create an image and then converted it with qemu-img. The images compared as identical both regularly and strictly, so that's good news. But their QEMU version is 6.0.0 on macOS 10.15.7.

I'm thinking about the differences between creating images on Mac vs. CentOS. APFS might handle disk images differently than ext4 or other filesystems used on Linux. Maybe there's an issue with how APFS writes sectors or handles certain offsets, causing the VMDK file to be non-bootable.

The user also provided hardware details, which show a powerful Mac setup but nothing that would indicate why the VMDK isn't working. The storage is an SSD, so it's fast and reliable, probably not the issue.

I'm wondering if there are any known issues with QEMU on macOS when handling APFS-formatted images. Maybe the way sectors are being handled or the way sparse images are created is different. Perhaps the -S 0 flag works in newer versions of QEMU or only under certain conditions.

Another thought: could it be related to how VMware handles VMDK files? Sometimes, even if a disk image is correctly converted by QEMU, VMware might have specific requirements for bootable images that aren't met when created on macOS. Maybe the user needs to adjust additional parameters when creating the VMDK file on Mac.

I should also consider whether the issue lies within how the image was initially created before conversion. If the initial image (image.img) has some metadata or headers that are not compatible with VMware when converted from a Mac, that could cause problems. The user's steps involved using dd to create the image and then converting it twice with qemu-img, which worked fine for CentOS but maybe behaves differently on macOS.

In summary, the possible issues could be:

1. Incompatibility in how APFS handles disk images compared to ext4 or other filesystems used on Linux.
2. Differences in how QEMU processes images on macOS versus CentOS, especially regarding sector handling and sparse files.
3. Specific requirements by VMware for VMDK files created on macOS that aren't met.

To troubleshoot further, the user might want to:

- Check if there are any known issues with creating VMDKs on macOS APFS using QEMU.
- Test using a different filesystem or method to create the image on Mac.
- Ensure that all conversion steps produce the same results across both systems.
- Consider applying any available patches or updates to QEMU for macOS.

It's also possible that this issue has been resolved in newer versions of QEMU, so updating their QEMU might help. Alternatively, using a different toolchain entirely to create the VMDK could be necessary if the current method consistently fails on macOS.

The user is experiencing issues with creating a bootable VMDK file on macOS using APFS and QEMU-img version 6.0.0. The process works correctly on CentOS with an older QEMU version but not on macOS despite using the -S 0 flag. 

Key points to consider:

1. **Compatibility Differences**: APFS might handle disk images differently compared to ext4, leading to issues in creating a bootable VMDK.
2. **Sector Handling**: The way sectors are processed by QEMU on macOS could differ from CentOS, affecting the conversion process.
3. **VMware Requirements**: VMware may have specific requirements for VMDK files that aren't met when created on macOS.

**Recommendations:**

- Check for known issues with creating VMDKs on macOS APFS using QEMU.
- Test using a different filesystem or method to create the image on Mac.
- Compare the conversion steps across both systems to ensure consistency.
- Consider updating QEMU or applying patches if available, as newer versions might resolve the issue.

By addressing these points, the user may find a solution that allows creating a functional VMDK file on their macOS system.
