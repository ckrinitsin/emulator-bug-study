Okay, I'm looking at this bug report about issues with PXE booting in Fedora 13. Let me try to understand the problem and figure out what's going on here.

From the messages, it seems like there were several attempts to resolve the issue. The user initially had trouble with the DHCP timeout when trying to boot via PXE. They mentioned that manually starting the VM and using certain commands helped them get an IP address, which allowed them to proceed with the PXE boot. However, they noticed that even after this workaround, there was still a problem, suggesting that the timeout might need adjustment.

Then, there's a lot of discussion about the end-of-life status for Fedora 13, so the bug is being closed because the OS version is no longer supported. The user was advised to open a new bug report if they could reproduce the issue in a later Fedora version.

I see that someone mentioned Virt-Manager working on F17, which implies that maybe this problem was fixed or worked around in newer versions. However, another person encountered an issue where there was no prompt for IPXE, indicating a possible regression or change in behavior.

Considering all of this, I think the main points are:

1. The original bug in Fedora 13 had issues with PXE booting due to a DHCP timeout.
2. Workarounds were suggested, but the problem wasn't entirely resolved.
3. Since F13 is EOL, the bug is being closed without a fix.
4. There's a possibility that similar issues exist in newer versions, so it's advisable to check those.

I should probably summarize this into a clear answer for someone who might be encountering this issue now.

The issue with PXE booting and DHCP timeout was reported in Fedora 13. While workarounds were suggested, the bug remains unresolved as Fedora 13 is no longer supported (end-of-life). If you encounter similar problems in newer Fedora versions, consider opening a new bug report with detailed information about your setup, including the OS version, QEMU version, and command line or logs.
