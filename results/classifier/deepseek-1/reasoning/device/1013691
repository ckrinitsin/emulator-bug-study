Okay, so I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user provided a detailed report where adding two virtio-scsi targets only allows the first disk to be seen by the guest. They mentioned that using the spapr-vscsi controller works fine, which suggests that the issue is specific to virtio-scsi.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The problem seems related to how devices are handled in QEMU, specifically with SCSI controllers. Since virtio-scsi isn't enumerating both disks correctly but spapr-vscsi does, it's likely a device-related issue. The bug is about the device (SCSI controller) not functioning as expected when multiple targets are added.

So, the category should be 'device' because it involves hardware emulation and device enumeration within the guest.
