Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report about QEMU. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.

The user is reporting an issue where they can't install OS/2 Warp v3 past disk 2 using QEMU. They mention that it worked fine with QEMU version 0.8.2, but stopped working in versions 1.0 and beyond, including the latest development version at the time of their report.

They performed a git bisect and found that the problem was introduced during a migration to new removable media handling before the 0.9.0 release. The specific commits mentioned are all related to changes in how QEMU handles removable media, like floppy drives or maybe CD/DVD handling.

The user also notes that they can install OS/2 Warp using other emulators like VirtualBox and then run it fine in QEMU. But when trying to do a pure QEMU installation, after disk 1, inserting disk 2 doesn't work as expected. They tried taking a snapshot during the installation of disk 2, then resuming with that state but still faced issues. Disk 7 had similar problems.

Additionally, they mention an unrelated issue where saving VM snapshots didn't work in QEMU versions 1.0 or later, which might be a separate bug but possibly related to how states are handled during the installation process.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, other.

The problem seems to be with removable media handlingâ€”specifically floppy disks since they mention using -fda. The git bisect points to changes in how QEMU handles these devices. So the issue likely falls under device-related bugs because it's about how the emulator interacts with the virtual floppy drive or hard disk during installation.

Mistranslation usually refers to issues when converting code between different architectures, but this doesn't seem related here. The problem is more about hardware emulation rather than assembly lowering or performance. It's also not a graphics or network issue. Booting itself isn't the main problem; it's that after booting, inserting disk 2 fails.

So the category should be 'device' because the bug relates to how QEMU handles removable devices during installation.
