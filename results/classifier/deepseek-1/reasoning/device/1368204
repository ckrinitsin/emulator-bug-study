Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The issue is about Windows Millennium Edition (WinME) not detecting the CD-ROM drive and other hard drives automatically in QEMU. The user mentions that they have to manually add an IDE controller driver for it to work.

First, let me look at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and other.

The problem seems related to hardware detection. WinME isn't recognizing the CD-ROM or additional hard drives unless the user manually adds an IDE controller driver. In real hardware, WinME would typically detect these automatically because of the presence of IDE controllers. So it's likely a problem with how QEMU emulates the hardware.

Looking at the categories, "device" seems relevant here. The issue is about devices (like CD-ROM and hard drives) not being detected properly. Alternatively, "peripherals" could also fit since we're talking about IDE controllers and storage devices. But "device" is more specific to individual devices, while "peripherals" might refer to a broader category.

I think the primary issue here is that QEMU's emulation of the device (IDE controller) isn't being recognized by WinME. Since it's related to hardware detection within the emulator, "device" seems like the most appropriate category.

The bug report describes an issue where Windows ME fails to automatically detect CD-ROM and other hard drives in QEMU, requiring manual driver installation for IDE controllers. This points to a problem with device emulation in QEMU.
