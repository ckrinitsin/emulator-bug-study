Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. The user reported that CMOS RTC alarms no longer wake the system from suspend after upgrading to QEMU 2.0.0. They mentioned that it worked in version 1.5 but broke after an upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04, which includes QEMU 2.0.

Looking at the list of possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about the RTC (Real-Time Clock) alarms not waking the system from suspend. The CMOS is part of the hardware devices emulated by QEMU. So this relates to how QEMU handles device emulation, specifically the RTC and power management functions.

I don't think it's under 'performance' because that would relate more to speed issues. It's also not a network or socket issue. The problem isn't with booting or VNC, nor is it a kernel or hypervisor issue directly. Instead, it's about peripherals (specifically the RTC) not functioning correctly during suspend.

So the category should be 'device' because it's an issue with how QEMU emulates a hardware device and its specific functionality.

The bug report describes an issue where CMOS RTC alarms no longer wake the system from suspend in QEMU. Since this involves hardware emulation, specifically the Real-Time Clock (RTC) device not functioning correctly during suspend, the appropriate category is:

**device**

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The problem relates to a hardware component (RTC), which QEMU emulates as a virtual device.
2. The issue affects the functionality of the RTC in waking the system from suspend.
3. Therefore, it falls under the 'device' category because it's about the emulation of a specific hardware device.

Answer: device
