Okay, I'm trying to figure out why my OpenStack instance on Ubuntu 18 LTS isn't booting properly. The Nova flow works fine, but when I try to access the console, it gets stuck with a timeout message about dev-vdb.device and issues with dependencies for /mnt and file system checks. 

First, let me understand what's happening here. The error messages mention that the boot process is timing out waiting for device dev-vdb.device. That sounds like an issue with how the system is handling storage devices during boot. Maybe it's not detecting or mounting the secondary disk correctly.

I know that Ubuntu 18 LTS introduced Netplan for network configuration, so perhaps there's a problem there affecting the boot process. But the user mentioned they receive an IP, so networking isn't completely brokenâ€”maybe just part of the boot sequence.

Looking at the logs provided, I see references to cloud-init and qemu packages being marked as invalid, which suggests that maybe the issue isn't directly with those components but something else upstream. The fact that it works in Rocky release but not on Ubuntu 18 makes me think there's a version mismatch or a dependency issue.

The user also advised using KVM instead of QEMU for better performance, implying that perhaps QEMU has some limitations here. Maybe the hypervisor isn't properly passing through resources needed for the instance to boot correctly.

I should check if my Nova logs have any relevant errors when trying to launch the instance. If I can get more detailed logs from both Nova and the instance's console, it might give me a better clue about where the failure is occurring during the boot process.

Another thought: Could this be related to how storage devices are exposed to the virtual machine? Maybe the disk isn't being presented correctly in the VM, leading to delays or failures when the system tries to access it. I should verify that /dev/vdb is properly set up and accessible from within the instance.

I also wonder if there's a conflict with cloud-init configurations. Since netplan is involved, perhaps there's an issue with how network interfaces are being managed during boot, causing delays or failures in setting up the environment needed for the system to proceed with the boot process.

To troubleshoot this further, I might want to:

1. Check if other instances on the same OpenStack deployment are working fine, which could indicate a specific problem with my instance configuration.
2. Review the Nova configuration and ensure that all relevant drivers and filters are correctly set up for the compute nodes.
3. Look into any recent updates or changes in the OpenStack environment that might have introduced this issue, such as changes in networking plugins (like Calico) or storage backends.
4. Test a minimal cloud-init configuration to see if it's an issue with user-specific configuration files versus a broader system problem.

Since the issue seems to be marked as invalid in several components like cloud-init and qemu, perhaps I need to look elsewhere, maybe into the Nova codebase or related projects for similar issues reported by others. If there's an existing GitHub issue or community discussion, that might provide insights or workarounds.

In summary, my approach would be:

- Gather detailed logs from Nova, the hypervisor (QEMU/KVM), and the instance's console.
- Verify storage configuration and device presentation in the VM.
- Check network configurations using netplan to ensure everything is set up correctly.
- Look for known issues or similar reports in OpenStack, Nova, or related projects.

If I can't find a solution through these steps, reaching out to the community forums or support channels with this information might help identify the root cause and potential fixes.

The issue you're encountering involves an OpenStack instance on Ubuntu 18 LTS where the boot process gets stuck due to problems with device detection and file system checks. Here's a structured approach to diagnose and resolve the problem:

### Problem Analysis:
- **Error Symptoms**: The instance fails to boot, showing timeouts related to `dev-vdb.device`, dependencies for `/mnt`, and file system checks.
- **Environment Details**: OpenStack Queens release on Ubuntu 18 LTS with KVM as the hypervisor.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Log Collection**:
   - **Nova Logs**: Check Nova's logs for any errors or warnings during instance launch.
   - **Hypervisor Logs (KVM/QEMU)**: Look into QEMU/KVM logs to identify if there are issues with device presentation or boot processes.
   - **Instance Console Logs**: Review the console output for detailed error messages and points where the process halts.

2. **Storage Configuration**:
   - Ensure that `/dev/vdb` is correctly presented to the VM and accessible during the boot process.
   - Verify storage settings in OpenStack (e.g., Cinder configuration) to confirm correct disk allocation and attachment.

3. **Network Configuration**:
   - Use Netplan to inspect network interface configurations on the instance.
   - Ensure that network interfaces are properly set up and not causing delays or failures during the boot sequence.

4. **Cloud-Init and Boot Process**:
   - Test with a minimal cloud-init configuration to isolate whether user data or specific config files are causing issues.
   - Check for any custom scripts or configurations in `cloud-init` that might interfere with the boot process.

5. **Hypervisor Choice**:
   - Consider using KVM instead of QEMU if not already done, as it may provide better performance and resource handling.

6. **Instance and Environment Checks**:
   - Compare with other instances to rule out environment-specific issues.
   - Look for recent updates or changes in the OpenStack deployment that might have introduced this issue.

7. **Community and Support**:
   - Search for similar issues in OpenStack, Nova, or related project repositories (GitHub, Jira).
   - Engage with community forums or support channels for insights or workarounds.

### Conclusion:
By systematically gathering logs, verifying configurations, and checking known issues, you can identify the root cause. If unresolved, reaching out to the OpenStack community with detailed information will aid in finding a solution.
