Okay, so I'm trying to understand this problem about RMRRs (Reserved Memory Regions) in the Linux kernel. From what I gather, RMRRs are memory regions set aside by the firmware (BIOS/UEFI), and they're supposed to be off-limits to the operating system for certain devices. The user is concerned that if you bypass these restrictions, especially when using GPU passthrough with KVM, it might lead to data corruption or other issues.

The initial message mentions that once a device is opened by the user (like in GPU passthrough), the firmware's identity mapping is removed. This could mean that any health or sensor data from the device isn't available anymore, which might cause problems for system behavior. Upstream developers have put restrictions to prevent this because bypassing them can lead to instability, hence the warning.

The user then asks if bypassing RMRRs can cause data corruption, especially in the context of the kernel 5.4 source needing changes to revert to older behavior (v5.3). They mention that VFIO IOMMU backend now enforces these restrictions more strictly, preventing certain mappings that might cause issues.

I'm thinking about how RMRRs work: they're supposed to protect sensitive memory regions used by devices and firmware. If a driver or hypervisor ignores these, it could interfere with the device's operation or the firmware's data handling. For GPU passthrough, this is crucial because the GPU communicates with the host using specific mappings, which might be in an RMRR.

The user also asks if there are other kernel areas that need modification to bring back old behavior. It sounds like the VFIO IOMMU backend has changed how it handles RMRRs, making bypassing them harder or impossible without causing issues.

Another point is whether ignoring RMRR entries could cause DMA failures or corruption when KVM tries to access those regions. Linux already has mechanisms to handle stubborn BIOS settings, but RMRRs might be a different case where simply ignoring isn't safe.

I'm wondering if there's a way to safely ignore RMRRs without causing problems. Maybe through kernel flags or configuration options? But the user was told they're their own support, implying that it's not recommended and could lead to system instability.

In summary, bypassing RMRR restrictions can lead to data corruption or device malfunction because those regions are meant for specific firmware interactions. The kernel changes in 5.4 enforce these restrictions more strictly than before, so reverting to older behavior might require modifying other parts of the kernel beyond just VFIO. However, doing so could be risky and unsupported, as the BIOS imposes these restrictions for a reason.

I'm also noting that this issue was moved from Launchpad to GitLab, suggesting it's part of QEMU's bug tracking transition. Since there's been no activity for 60 days, the ticket has expired on Launchpad, but if someone still cares, they should move it to GitLab as per instructions.

Overall, my understanding is that ignoring RMRRs isn't safe and can cause more problems than it solves, especially in GPU passthrough setups where stability is crucial. The kernel changes are a response to potential issues arising from bypassing these restrictions.

The issue revolves around the risks of bypassing Reserved Memory Regions (RMRRs) in the Linux kernel, particularly for GPU passthrough configurations. Here's a structured summary:

1. **Understanding RMRRs**: 
   - RMRRs are memory regions set aside by firmware (BIOS/UEFI) for specific devices to prevent OS interference.
   - These regions are crucial for device-firmware communication, handling data like sensor information.

2. **Bypassing RMRR Risks**:
   - Ignoring RMRR restrictions can lead to data corruption or device malfunction as these regions are essential for firmware operations.
   - The VFIO IOMMU backend in newer kernels (e.g., 5.4) enforces these restrictions more strictly, preventing certain mappings that could cause instability.

3. **Kernel Modifications**:
   - Reverting to older kernel behavior (e.g., v5.3) might require changes beyond VFIO, but doing so is unsupported and risky.
   - Bypassing RMRRs can result in DMA failures or corruption when KVM interacts with these regions.

4. **Safety Considerations**:
   - There's no safe method to ignore RMRR entries without risking system instability. The kernel changes are intended to prevent such issues.
   - The user is cautioned that modifying these settings is unsupported and could lead to unforeseen problems.

5. **Bug Tracking Update**:
   - The issue was moved from Launchpad to GitLab, indicating a transition in bug tracking systems. Due to inactivity, the ticket has expired on Launchpad.

**Conclusion**: Bypassing RMRR restrictions is not recommended due to potential data corruption and instability risks. Kernel changes enforce these protections for good reason, particularly in GPU passthrough setups requiring stability.
