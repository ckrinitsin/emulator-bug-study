Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to get AIX 7.2 to boot correctly on QEMU. From what I understand, there was an issue with a specific H-call in QEMU that caused a crash when hotplugging CPUs in certain conditions, especially on memory-less or CPU-less NUMA nodes. The fix involved modifying the code in `hw/ppc/xics.c` and removing some warning messages.

I tried applying this fix by updating QEMU to version 4.2.0 but it didn't work. AIX still wouldn't boot properly. I noticed that when using SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) with POWER9, the system would reboot at a certain point during the IPL process. However, when I disabled SMP and switched to a single CPU configuration with POWER7, it managed to boot until another error occurred.

The user mentioned that they were able to get AIX working with QEMU version 2.11.2 but not with newer versions. This suggests that somewhere between 2.11.2 and the current version (around git commit 5.0.50v5.0.0-997-g9e7f1469b9-dirty), something broke for AIX.

I also saw that there's an existing issue on GitLab tracking this problem, which is good because it means the QEMU community is aware and working on it. The user provided a link to that issue: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/269. It seems like I should continue the discussion there for better visibility and collaboration.

So, my next steps would be:

1. Visit the GitLab issue page linked above.
2. Read through any existing comments or discussions to see if others have encountered similar problems or found workarounds.
3. Provide more details about my setup, including the exact QEMU versions I've tried, the specific errors encountered, and any configurations that worked (like the single CPU with POWER7).
4. Engage with the community by asking questions or offering additional information that might help pinpoint the issue.

By participating in the GitLab issue, I can contribute to finding a solution more effectively than continuing here, especially since Launchpad is transitioning to GitLab for bug tracking.
