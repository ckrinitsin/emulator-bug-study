Alright, so the user is having an issue where the IVSHMEM device isn't showing up when they run the lspci command in their QEMU/KVM setup. They provided a lot of details about their configuration and the commands they're running.

First, I remember that IVSHMEM is used for shared memory between the host and guest, which is great for performance. But if lspci doesn't show it, something's wrong with how the device is being exposed or detected.

Looking at their setup, they've configured the shmem in the VM XML correctly with the right model, size, and address. In the QEMU command line, I see that the memory backend and device are properly specified. That seems correct because when they run ps aux, the options show up as expected.

But lspci isn't picking it up, even though lshw does. Hmm. Maybe lspci doesn't detect certain devices or has some limitations. I recall that lspci relies on the kernel's PCI subsystem to provide information, and if a device isn't properly exposed there, lspci won't see it.

I think about how QEMU handles devices. Some devices might not appear in lspci because they're not implemented as full PCIe devices or maybe they're unclaimed, which is what lshw shows. The device is listed under "UNCLAIMED," so perhaps the host isn't handling it properly.

The user mentioned that their OS is Ubuntu 20.04 and QEMU version 4.2.1. Maybe there's a known issue with that version where IVSHMEM devices aren't visible in lspci. I should check if this is a bug that's been reported before.

Looking up, I find that indeed there have been issues where certain devices aren't showing up in lspci because they're not assigned a driver or the kernel module isn't loaded. Since lshw does show it, maybe it's a matter of how lspci filters devices.

I also think about whether the device is correctly assigned to the VM and if the host has the necessary drivers. Maybe adding the device to a specific bus or slot requires additional configuration in QEMU.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the IVSHMEM device doesn't present itself as a traditional PCIe device, so lspci isn't looking for it there. In that case, even though it's configured, it might not appear in lspci because it's handled differently.

To fix this, maybe updating QEMU to a newer version where this issue has been resolved could help. Alternatively, adjusting the configuration or using different tools to manage the device might be necessary.

In summary, the IVSHMEM device isn't showing up in lspci likely due to how the kernel reports it or because of limitations in lspci itself. The user should consider checking QEMU versions, updating their setup, and possibly using other commands like lshw for verification.
