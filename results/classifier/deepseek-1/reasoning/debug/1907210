Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user provided a detailed description of an issue they're encountering with QEMU's gdbstub. They mentioned that when using a third-party GDB client and sending the "?" command, all breakpoints get removed by QEMU. This behavior isn't expected because, according to the official GDB documentation, the "?" command should only return the stop reason, not modify the state like removing breakpoints.

The user also included some code context from gdbstub.c where there's a comment indicating that the developer intended to remove breakpoints during initial connection since they assumed most clients only use "?" at that point. However, the user argues that this approach is incorrect and suggests that initial connection should be detected differently rather than using the "?" command.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue revolves around how QEMU's gdbstub handles a specific GDB command, which affects breakpoints during debugging sessions. This seems to be related to the debugging functionality of QEMU. The category "debug" fits best because it pertains to the interaction with the debugger and how breakpoints are managed.
