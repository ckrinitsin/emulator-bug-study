Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what's going on here with the build warnings when compiling QEMU 5.0.0-rc2. The user mentioned that there are some issues related to struct declarations and a function definition causing warnings, but the build still succeeded. They also referenced an upstream fix in rc3.

First, I'll look at the warnings provided:

1. **memory.h:3**: A warning about the type of declaration for `struct MemoryListener`. It says that if it's just a name, there's an error in the declarator or parameters because it expects an identifier but got 'struct'. Similarly, if it's a typedef-like declaration, there's another issue.

2. **memory.h:428**: Same warning for `struct AddressSpace`.

3. **memory.h:673**: Same warning for `struct MemoryRegionSection`.

4. **memory.h:834**: An error in the declarator or parameters for a function definition of `memory_region_init_resizeable_ram`. It seems like there's an issue with missing a closing parenthesis or comma.

I remember that in C, struct declarations should be either as a tag name (like `struct MemoryListener;`) or using a typedef (like `typedef struct { ... } MemoryListener;`). The warnings suggest that the code is not following the correct syntax for one of these forms.

Looking at the function definition warning, the issue might be with how the parameters are declared. It looks like the function signature isn't properly closed. Maybe there's a missing parenthesis or a semicolon.

The user mentioned an upstream fix in rc3 and provided a link to a GitHub issue regarding this problem. I should check that issue for context. The issue seems to relate to changes in how Sphinx handles certain C declarations, which might have introduced these warnings.

In their response, the user clarifies that they meant there were only warnings, not errors, so the build was successful but with some issues. They also pointed out that this is a known problem in the Sphinx documentation tool and provided a link to the fix.

So, the main points are:

- The build succeeded despite 4 warnings related to struct declarations and function definitions.
- These warnings are due to changes in how Sphinx processes C code, specifically in handling struct tags and function parameters.
- A fix has been applied upstream, which is available in QEMU 5.0-rc3.

I should probably update the documentation or apply any necessary patches if I'm building from source. Using rc3 or newer versions of QEMU should resolve these issues without warnings.

The build for QEMU 5.0.0-rc2 encountered four warnings related to struct declarations and a function definition, but it still succeeded. These warnings are due to changes in the Sphinx documentation tool affecting how C code is processed. The user has reported this issue upstream, and a fix was included in QEMU 5.0-rc3. To resolve these warnings, you should use QEMU version 5.0-rc3 or newer.

**Answer:**

The warnings are resolved by using QEMU 5.0-rc3 or later, as the issue has been fixed upstream.
