Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user is experiencing extremely slow boot times when using OVMF on Ubuntu 16.04 with Qemu 2.5.0. They mention that everything works fine with Arch Linux but has issues under Ubuntu.

So the problem occurs during the boot process, specifically until Windows loads. The CPU usage is maxed out on all cores during this time, which suggests a significant performance hit. After booting, things work normally, so it's not an issue with the running OS but rather during the initial startup phase.

The user tried using the OVMF firmware from apt instead of their previous one and saw improvement. This makes me think that there might be compatibility issues between the versions of QEMU, the host kernel, or the OVMF firmware they were using.

Looking at the categories provided: boot seems directly related because the issue is with the boot process. Other options like performance could also apply since it's about speed, but "boot" is more specific here.

I should choose the most appropriate category. Since the problem is occurring during the boot and relates to OVMF interaction, "boot" fits best.

The bug report describes an issue where booting a virtual machine with OVMF on Ubuntu using QEMU 2.5.0 is extremely slow. The problem occurs during the boot process, specifically until Windows loads, causing high CPU usage. After solving it by using a different OVMF package, the issue resolved.

The key aspect here is that the problem occurs during the boot process of the virtual machine. Therefore, the appropriate category for this bug report is:

**boot**
