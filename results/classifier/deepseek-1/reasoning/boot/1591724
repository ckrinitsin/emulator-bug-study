Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is having trouble installing Windows 7 using QEMU version 2.6.0 with OVMF. They mentioned that when they use different VGA options like std, cirrus, qxl, or virtio, the installation process hangs at "Starting Windows." 

They referenced a specific commit (94ef4f3) which was supposed to fix this issue but it didn't work for them even after applying it. They also mentioned that with OVMF without SeaBIOS CSM and Cirrus video, Windows 7 installation hasn't been supported before. The VBE Shim in OVMF only works on stdvga and QXL, as per the documentation.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue is related to booting from a Windows 7 installation DVD in QEMU with OVMF and specific VGA options. Since the problem occurs during the boot process and relates to hardware devices (like the video card), it seems like a device-related bug. The user mentioned different VGA options causing hangs, so it's tied to how the virtual devices are handled during the boot.

Therefore, the most appropriate category here is 'boot' because the issue arises during the booting of the guest OS and relates to hardware configurations that affect the boot process.

The bug report describes issues with installing Windows 7 using QEMU and OVMF, specifically when different VGA options are used. The problem occurs during the boot process, which suggests it's related to how the virtual devices (like the video card) interact with the booting OS. Given that the issue is tied to hardware configuration and booting behavior, the appropriate category is:

**boot**
