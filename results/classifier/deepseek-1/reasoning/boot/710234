Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is having trouble with QEMU segfaulting immediately when they start it, regardless of whether they're using an image or not. They've tried both the latest development version and qemu-0.13.0 without success.

First, I need to look at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user mentioned that they tried running QEMU with and without an image. The segfault happens regardless. They also noted that even when using the -nographic option, it still crashes, which suggests it's not related to graphics since without a GUI, there shouldn't be any issues with the display.

They've considered recompiling QEMU with --disable-kvm but that didn't help. Since KVM is part of the hypervisor functions in QEMU, maybe this could be related, but the problem persists even when KVM is disabled. 

The segfault occurs at startup, which makes me think about the boot process. Could there be an issue during initialization? Maybe something wrong with how QEMU initializes its components or loads the configuration.

Looking at the categories again: 'boot' seems like a possible fit because it's related to the initial stages of starting the emulator. Other options like 'hypervisor' relate more to KVM, which they've already tried disabling without effect. 'Kernel' might be too generic, but since QEMU is a user-space program, kernel issues are less likely unless there's a system call failure.

The user mentioned that when using a garbled command line, it returns an error and exits normally, so the crash isn't related to improper command-line arguments in general. The fact that they're getting a segfault without any specific input (like an image) points towards a fundamental issue during QEMU's own initialization or setup.

I think 'boot' is the most appropriate category here because it directly relates to the process of starting QEMU, which is failing with a segmentation fault early on.

The bug report describes a segfault occurring immediately when starting QEMU, regardless of whether an image is provided. The issue persists across different versions and configurations, including disabling KVM. Since the segfault happens at startup and isn't related to graphics or user input, it's likely tied to the initialization process rather than specific functionality. 

The most fitting category is:

**boot**
