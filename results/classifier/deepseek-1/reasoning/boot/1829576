Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned that their QEMU-SYSTEM-PPC64 stopped working after upgrading from version 3.1.0 to 4.0.0. They downgraded and it worked again, so the issue is specific to the newer version.

They provided details about how they run their CentOS7 PPC image and included a link to the QCOW2 file. The user suspects the problem might be related to the VSR register conversion and even shared some patches from qemu-devel that fixed the issue when applied. After applying these patches, the system boots correctly.

The user also mentioned another regression involving an AIX guest but is unsure whether to open a new ticket or use this one. They referenced David's ppc-for-4.1 branch where the patches are queued for merging.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, other.

The issue is about QEMU failing to boot a guest OS after an upgrade. The specific problem was likely in the emulation of PPC hardware or related to how the MMU (Memory Management Unit) was handled, as suggested by the user's mention of VSR registers and patches applied. Since it's about the boot process failing, which is a critical part of starting up the virtual machine.

The fix involved changes in the QEMU codebase, specifically in the PPC64 target or related to device emulation for PPC systems. The category 'boot' seems appropriate here because the problem was preventing the guest OS from booting correctly under the new version of QEMU.
