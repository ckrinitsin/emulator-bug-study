Okay, I'm trying to understand this discussion about QEMU and image formats. So, from what I gather, there are two main points being discussed: using non-raw formats over NBD exports and the vvfat driver warning.

First, Stefan is saying that it's okay to use non-raw formats on top of NBD. He gives an example where you can have nested qcow2 images, like a qcow2 file inside another qcow2 image. This could be useful for nested virtualization setups, where each guest sees different layers of the disk. But he also notes that having too many layers (like three) might complicate things because you'd need multiple qemu-nbd instances, making it hard to manage.

Max responds by agreeing that while such a setup is theoretically possible, it's not practical or efficient. He thinks that using more than one layer of wrapping doesn't add much value and might just be overcomplicating things. He suggests that for real-world use cases, it's better to stick with a single layer of qcow2.

Then, the conversation shifts to vvfat, which is another driver in QEMU used for FAT filesystems on block devices. The issue here is a warning message that appears when using vvfat without specifying the image format. Max says this warning still exists in newer versions of QEMU and that it's more of a nuisance than a critical bug.

He also mentions that vvfat isn't his favorite driver, but deprecating it might not be the right move since there's an existing bug report about it. He suggests possible fixes, like adding explicit format specifications or implementing some infrastructure changes to handle the warnings better. However, he feels this isn't a high priority and would rather focus on other issues.

So, summarizing my understanding: The discussion revolves around whether non-raw formats should be allowed over NBD exports and how to address the warning messages with vvfat. Stefan supports allowing nested protocols but acknowledges potential complexity, while Max questions the practicality of such setups. Regarding vvfat, both agree it's a low-priority issue but acknowledge that fixing it would require some work without offering immediate benefits.

I'm a bit confused about why using non-raw formats over NBD is being debated in terms of use cases and maintenance. It seems like allowing flexibility is good, but practicality and ease of management are also important factors. For vvfat, the warning is more of a minor inconvenience rather than a major bug, so fixing it might not be a top priority.

I think I need to look up what NBD exports exactly do and how they interact with image formats to better grasp why allowing non-raw on them is significant. Also, understanding why vvfat's warning is such a low-priority issue would help me see the bigger picture in QEMU development.

The discussion revolves around two main topics: using non-raw image formats over NBD exports and addressing warnings with the vvfat driver in QEMU.

1. **Non-Raw Formats Over NBD Exports**:
   - **Use Cases**: Nested virtualization setups where multiple layers of qcow2 images are used to provide disks at different levels (e.g., an L0 guest sees one layer, while an L1 guest sees another).
   - **Challenges**: Managing complex setups with multiple layers can become unwieldy, requiring several qemu-nbd instances. This complexity might not be justified in most practical scenarios.
   - **Conclusion**: While theoretically possible, the practicality and efficiency of such setups are questioned.

2. **vvfat Driver Warning**:
   - **Issue**: A warning appears when using vvfat without specifying the image format, highlighting potential security risks with raw images.
   - **Solutions**: 
     - Adding explicit format specifications (e.g., `format=raw`).
     - Implementing changes to handle these warnings better, though this is seen as a low-priority task.
   - **Conclusion**: The warning is considered more of a nuisance than a critical bug. Fixing it requires effort but offers minimal benefits, making it a lower priority compared to other tasks.

**Summary**: The debate highlights the balance between allowing flexibility in image formats and managing complexity. For NBD exports, while supporting non-raw formats offers theoretical benefits, practicality is often limited. Regarding vvfat, addressing the warning is seen as low-priority due to its minor impact on real-world usage.
