Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why my QEMU is giving me all these errors about underruns and failing to create certain audio voices. Let's see... I'm using Gentoo Linux with the same 64-bit system, and even after updating to QEMU 2.9, the problem persists.

First off, the error messages mention "ALSA lib pcm.c:7843:(snd_pcm_recover) underrun occurred." Underruns usually happen when the application can't keep up with the audio buffer, causing data loss. But why is this happening in QEMU?

I'm running QEMU with some specific parameters: -soundhw ac97, which means it's using the AC'97 sound hardware emulation. Maybe there's an issue with how QEMU handles the AC'97 model.

Looking at the packages, I have alsa-lib-1.1.4 and qemu-2.9.0-r54 installed. The dependencies seem okay, but perhaps there's a compatibility issue between QEMU and ALSA-Lib versions.

I should check if other people are having similar issues. Maybe it's a known bug in QEMU that was fixed in later versions. Since the user mentioned moving to GitLab, I'll look up the linked issue: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/69. If that's an inactive or closed issue, maybe it's not being worked on anymore.

Another thought: could my host system's audio configuration be causing problems? Maybe QEMU isn't getting enough CPU time to handle the audio buffers properly. I'm using KVM acceleration with -enable-kvm, so maybe there's a scheduling issue.

I should also consider if other sound backends like PulseAudio or PipeWire would work better than ALSA for QEMU. Sometimes switching backends can resolve issues where the default one doesn't perform well.

If changing backends isn't an option, perhaps adjusting QEMU's audio settings could help. Maybe using a different audio driver with -soundhw something else? Or tweaking buffer sizes?

I'm not sure about these possibilities, so I'll need to research more or try some experiments. Maybe starting without sound to see if the issue persists, then adding it back in steps to isolate where the problem occurs.

In summary, possible causes are: QEMU's AC'97 emulation bug, ALSA-Lib version compatibility, host audio configuration issues, or resource allocation problems on the host system.

The user is encountering audio-related errors when running QEMU with AC'97 sound hardware emulation. The issue likely stems from a known problem in QEMU that has been moved to GitLab. Potential solutions include checking for updates, adjusting audio settings, or trying alternative sound backends like PulseAudio. Further investigation may involve isolating the problem by testing without sound or altering QEMU parameters.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Issue**: The errors indicate ALSA underruns and failed creation of AC'97 voices in QEMU.

2. **Research the Bug**: The issue has been reported in QEMU's GitLab tracker (Issue #69). Check if it's active or resolved.

3. **Update Software**: Ensure both QEMU and ALSA-Lib are up-to-date, though updates may not fix the bug.

4. **Test Without Sound**: Run QEMU without sound to see if the issue persists, helping to isolate whether it's sound-related.

5. **Adjust Audio Settings**: Modify QEMU's audio settings, such as buffer sizes or drivers, to prevent underruns.

6. **Try Alternative Backends**: Switch to different audio backends like PulseAudio or PipeWire to avoid ALSA issues.

7. **Check Host Configuration**: Ensure host system audio settings and resource allocation (CPU, memory) are sufficient for QEMU's needs.

8. **Consult Forums/Communities**: Seek advice from QEMU user groups or forums for known workarounds or patches.

9. **Consider Reporting New Issues**: If the problem persists with updated software, report a new issue with detailed information.

**Answer:**

The issue you're experiencing is likely related to a known bug in QEMU's AC'97 sound hardware emulation, which has been moved to GitLab. To resolve this:

1. Check if Issue #69 on GitLab is active for updates or workarounds.
2. Try running QEMU without sound to see if the problem persists.
3. Experiment with different audio backends (e.g., PulseAudio) by using `-soundhw other-backend`.
4. Adjust QEMU's audio settings, such as buffer sizes, to prevent underruns.
5. Ensure your host system has adequate resources allocated for QEMU processes.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, consider reporting a new bug with detailed information about your setup and the problem encountered.
