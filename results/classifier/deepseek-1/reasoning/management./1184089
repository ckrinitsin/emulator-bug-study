Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report from QEMU. Let's read through it carefully.

The user starts by talking about a feature request to load a snapshot as read-only. They mention that the current setup lacks the ability to load a live snapshot and redirect future changes to a temp file, which would make the original snapshot read-only. This would prevent users from accidentally corrupting their images.

They refer to some old mailing list discussions where patches were submitted but didn't result in any implementation. Then they explain how using migrate with QMP commands allows them to achieve a similar effect by saving and loading snapshots without modifying the original image.

The main issue here is about handling snapshots, specifically about being able to load them in a way that doesn't write back to the original file, making it read-only for the session. This falls under how QEMU manages storage or block devices because snapshots are part of disk I/O operations.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, network, KVM, etc. The closest fit seems to be 'device' since it's related to handling storage devices and their configurations. Alternatively, 'files' could be considered, but that might not cover the functionality aspect as well as 'device'.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's more about how QEMU interacts with block devices when taking snapshots. Since this is about loading a snapshot read-only and redirecting writes elsewhere, it pertains to block device management. However, none of the categories directly mention block devices.

Looking at the options again: 'files' might relate, but perhaps 'other' is safer if none fit perfectly. But considering that this affects how snapshots are handled during VM operations, which could tie into the hypervisor's functionality, maybe 'hypervisor' isn't the right category either.

Alternatively, since it's about modifying how QEMU reads and writes to the disk (block devices), perhaps 'device' is still the best fit. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct classification.

Wait, another angle: this feature request is about snapshots, which are part of the VM's state management. Perhaps it's more related to the hypervisor's internal operations rather than user-mode issues. So maybe 'hypervisor' isn't the category here but something else.

Looking back at the categories again: The options include 'mistranslation', 'assembly', 'device', etc. Since this is about snapshots and disk operations, 'device' still seems plausible because it's related to how block devices are handled when loading a snapshot.

I think I'll go with 'hypervisor' because it's about managing the VM's state and storage, which falls under the hypervisor's responsibilities. Alternatively, if there's no specific category for snapshots or disk management, perhaps 'other'.

The classification of this bug report is:

**Hypervisor**

This report pertains to how QEMU handles snapshots and redirects writes during VM operations, which relates to the hypervisor's state management.
