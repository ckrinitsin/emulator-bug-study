Okay, I'm trying to figure out this problem with QEMU and the -runas option not working as expected. So from what I understand, when you start a QEMU process with -runas nobody, it's supposed to drop privileges to the 'nobody' user. But apparently, there was an issue where this didn't happen correctly for all parts of the process, especially if threads were created before the privilege drop.

Looking at the provided logs and messages, it seems that the problem was related to timing. The -runas processing happens too late in the QEMU startup process. By the time os_setup_post() is called, which handles the -runas option, some threads might have already been spawned. Since those threads inherit the parent's privileges, they wouldn't be dropped properly.

Andrew Griffiths mentioned that his mistake was thinking the -runas processing happens earlier in os_parse_cmd_args(), but it actually happens later, after some threads might have started. So this caused issues where not all parts of the process ran under the correct user and group.

Stefan pointed out that this issue has been fixed by a specific commit: http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=cc4662f9642995c78. So it looks like the QEMU developers moved the -runas processing earlier in the startup sequence, ensuring that all threads are created after the privileges have been dropped.

Mike provided some steps to reproduce the issue and also showed that on his system, when he runs QEMU with -runas nobody, the process correctly changes its user and group. The /proc status shows that both the main process and its tasks have the Uid and Gid set to 99 (which is probably the 'nobody' user's ID). This suggests that after the fix, the issue is resolved for Linux hosts using a modern glibc.

However, Andrew noted that uClibc or non-Linux hosts might still be affected if they don't apply setuid/setgid to all threads. So while the main problem on Linux with glibc is fixed, other environments might require additional checks.

To ensure universal compatibility, the best approach would be to perform the -runas processing before any threads are created. This way, every thread spawned afterward will inherit the dropped privileges correctly.

Mike also mentioned a reproduction code gist that demonstrates the difference between using glibc and raw system calls. This is useful for testing whether the issue persists across different environments. Since Alpine Linux uses musl libc (not glibc), it's another example where the fix might not be sufficient unless all threads are set to the correct user and group.

In conclusion, while the main issue on modern Linux systems using glibc has been addressed with the commit mentioned, care must still be taken for environments using different C libraries or non-Linux systems. The key takeaway is that dropping privileges as early as possible in the process lifecycle ensures all subsequent threads are created under the correct user context.

The problem arises because QEMU's -runas option drops privileges too late in the startup process, after some threads have already been spawned, causing those threads to retain root privileges. This was fixed by moving the -runas processing earlier, ensuring all threads are created with the correct user and group.

**Answer:**

The issue has been resolved by adjusting when QEMU processes the -runas option, ensuring it happens before any threads are created. This allows all threads to inherit the dropped privileges correctly. For Linux systems using modern glibc, this fix is sufficient. However, environments using uClibc or non-Linux systems should ensure that setuid/setgid is applied to all threads for full compatibility.

**Final Answer:**

The bug has been fixed by ensuring -runas processing occurs early in the QEMU startup process, so all threads are created under the correct user context. This addresses the issue on Linux with modern glibc, while other environments may require additional measures. For comprehensive solutions across different systems, apply setuid/setgid to all threads.
