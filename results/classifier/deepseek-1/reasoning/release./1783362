Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the bug was handled in this QEMU project. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, Alex used "r-b" in his message. I remember seeing " Reviewed-By:" somewhere before. It must be a tag he added when reviewing the patch. So that's cleared up.

Next, Laurent mentioned that the fix is committed but not yet released. He said it will be out on 7th or 14th of August. Since the user already tested it and it works, they should mark the bug as 'Fix Committed'. Once it's part of a release, then it becomes 'Fix Released'.

Lastly, about where Laurent pushed his commits before merging into QEMU's main repo. He said he uses his own GitHub fork at git://github.com/vivier/qemu.git and works on branches like linux-user-for-3.0. So the process is: developers send patches via mailing list, maintainers collect them, create pull requests from their forks, and then merge into QEMU's master.

I think that covers all the points the user was confused about. Now I can summarize this in a clear way.

The handling of the bug in the QEMU project can be broken down as follows:

1. **Reviewed-By Tag**: The "r-b" mentioned by Alex refers to the "Reviewed-By:" tag, which is used to indicate that a patch has been reviewed and approved for inclusion.

2. **Bug Status Update**: Since the fix has been committed but not yet released, the appropriate status for the bug should be marked as 'Fix Committed'. Once the release date (around 7th or 14th of August) arrives, it can then be updated to 'Fix Released'.

3. **Commit Process**: The maintainers handle patches sent via the mailing list by collecting them into their own repositories (such as Laurent's fork at git://github.com/vivier/qemu.git). They prepare pull requests on branches like linux-user-for-3.0 and merge these into QEMU's main repository.

In summary, the bug has been addressed with a committed fix, and the status should reflect this until it is included in an official release.
