Okay, so I'm trying to understand why QEMU's `-snapshot` option doesn't work when using `-blockdev`. From what I gather, there are a few key points here. First, I know that `-snapshot` was originally designed for the `-drive` option and not for `-blockdev`. 

When you use `-drive`, it seems like QEMU automatically creates an overlay in `/tmp` to handle snapshots. But with `-blockdev`, this automatic behavior doesn't happen because the user is responsible for setting up the block graph explicitly.

I'm a bit confused about why `-snapshot` isn't supported with `-blockdev`. Is it because `-blockdev` requires manual setup, whereas `-drive` handles it automatically? So when using `-blockdev`, you have to manually create and manage these temporary files, which is something that QEMU can't do as seamlessly as it does with `-drive`.

Also, the user mentioned that since libvirt has switched to using `-blockdev`, it's more work for them to support snapshots properly. They might need to implement a feature where they precreate these wrapper files or use QMP commands to manage the block devices.

So, putting this together, I think the main issue is that `-snapshot` relies on QEMU creating temporary files automatically, which doesn't align with how `-blockdev` operates. Therefore, without changes in libvirt's management of the block graph, snapshots aren't supported when using `-blockdev`.

The technical difference lies in how QEMU handles snapshot functionality based on whether `-drive` or `-blockdev` is used.

1. **-drive vs. -blockdev**:
   - When using `-drive`, QEMU automatically creates a temporary overlay file in `/tmp` to handle snapshots, making it seamless for the user.
   - With `-blockdev`, users must manually construct the block graph, including creating and managing any necessary temporary files.

2. **Libvirt's Role**:
   - Libvirt uses `-blockdev` for more control over disk configurations, which requires explicit setup of each block device component.
   - Implementing snapshots with `-blockdev` would need libvirt to precreate these temporary files or use QMP commands to manage them, adding complexity.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The `-snapshot` option isn't supported with `-blockdev` because it relies on automatic file creation handled by `-drive`, which isn't compatible with the explicit management required by `-blockdev`. This necessitates further development in libvirt to support snapshots properly under `-blockdev`.
