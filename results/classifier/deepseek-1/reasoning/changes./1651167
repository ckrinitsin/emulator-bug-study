Alright, I need to understand the problem and fix that was applied in the provided code snippet. Let me look through it step by step.

The user provided a patch where several macros are modified. The old versions of these macros have an extra space before the assignment operator '=' in their definitions. For example:

- #define IPMI_BT_SET_ATN(d, v)  (d) = (((d) & ~IPMI_BT_B2H_ATN_MASK) | ...

And the new version removes that space:

+ #define IPMI_BT_SET_ATN(d, v)  ((d) = (((d) & ~IPMI_BT_B2H_ATN_MASK) | ...

I notice that in C programming, spaces around operators like '=' aren't typically required. However, maintaining consistency is important for readability and to adhere to coding standards.

So, the fix seems to be about removing an unnecessary space before the assignment operator in these macro definitions. This makes the code cleaner and follows standard formatting practices where spacing isn't needed between the parenthesis and the equals sign.

I should verify if this change could affect the functionality. Since it's just a formatting change without altering any logic, it shouldn't introduce any bugs but will improve code readability and maintain consistency across the file.

Another thing to consider is whether all these macros were modified consistently. Looking at the patch, yes, each macro that had the space before '=' has been updated to remove it. That's good for maintaining a uniform style.

In summary, the change is purely cosmetic, improving code formatting by removing unnecessary spaces around operators in macro definitions.

The changes made in the provided code are purely stylistic and do not affect functionality. They involve removing an extra space before the assignment operator '=' in several macro definitions. This improves code readability by adhering to standard formatting practices where such spaces are typically omitted.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify the Change:**
   - The macros `IPMI_BT_SET_*` (e.g., ATN, SMS_ATN, HBUSY, etc.) had an extra space before the assignment operator '='.
   
2. **Understand the Impact:**
   - This is a formatting change and does not alter the functionality since spaces around operators are generally ignored in C.

3. **Consistency:**
   - The update ensures all similar macros follow the same style, improving code maintainability.

4. **No Functional Changes:**
   - The logic of the macros remains unchanged; only their appearance is adjusted for consistency.

### Conclusion:
The modifications are part of a code cleanup to ensure uniformity in coding style without introducing any functional changes.
