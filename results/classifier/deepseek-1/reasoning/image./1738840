Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. So the user is having issues with some disk images and converting them using APFS. They provided a bunch of hexdump outputs and commands they ran.

First, from their output, it looks like they're working with several files:

1. `coreos_production_openstack_image.bin` – this seems to be a raw image that's working fine because when compared against the original `.img.org`, it matches.
2. `coreos_production_openstack_image.bin.apfs` – this was created without any special arguments, but when converted using APFS, the resulting file is only 16MB and considered "bad". They mentioned that using "-S 0" made the file larger (8.5GB) but it's still bad.
3. `coreos_production_openstack_image.bin.apfs2` – this was created with the "-S 0" option, which makes a much larger file, but when compared to `.img.org`, there's a content mismatch.

They also ran some commands:

- Using `qemu-img compare`, they found that the original image and `.bin` are identical.
- When comparing against `.bin.apfs2`, it shows a mismatch at offset 0, indicating something is wrong with the APFS-converted images.
- The `diff` command showed that `.bin` and `.bin.apfs` differ, but `.bin` and `.bin.apfs2` also differ.

In their hexdump, they noticed that some areas are filled with zeroes, which might indicate corruption or incorrect padding. They also mentioned that the file size seems small and wrong, suggesting that maybe the conversion process is truncating the image or not handling it properly.

Looking at the hexdump output:

- The "good" `.bin` has a lot of non-zero data spread out.
- The "bad" `.apfs` files have large sections of zeroes, especially early on. For example, from 0cc4f040 to some later addresses, there are long sequences of zeroes which shouldn't be there in a properly converted image.

They also mentioned that when using "-S 0", the file size increases but it's still bad, implying that perhaps this option isn't solving the underlying issue. The fact that the original and `.bin` match suggests that `.bin` is correct, so maybe the problem lies in how APFS conversion is being handled.

Possible issues:

1. **Incorrect Conversion Parameters**: Maybe the default settings when using APFS aren't suitable for their use case, leading to incomplete or corrupted images.
2. **File Size Handling**: The file size after conversion being 16MB instead of expected might mean that only a part of the original image is being captured, or padding isn't done correctly.
3. **Hexdump Analysis**: The zeroes in the early parts of `.bin.apfs` and `.bin.apfs2` suggest that either the data wasn't written properly or there's an issue with how sectors are being handled.

To resolve this, I should consider:

- Checking if APFS requires specific parameters for correct conversion, especially regarding the size.
- Verifying if the original image is indeed compatible with APFS and what flags might be needed during conversion to ensure data integrity.
- Testing whether using different options or tools can produce a correct raw image that matches the original.

I'm thinking they need to adjust how they're converting the image. Maybe "-S 0" isn't enough, or perhaps there's another parameter to specify the exact size of the output file. Alternatively, using a different tool or method for conversion might be necessary if APFS isn't handling it correctly by default.

The issue you're encountering appears to stem from how the APFS conversion is being handled, particularly with respect to image sizing and data integrity. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the problem and potential solutions:

### Problem Analysis:
1. **File Differences**:
   - `coreos_production_openstack_image.bin` (working) matches the original `.img.org`.
   - APFS-converted files (`bin.apfs`, `bin.apfs2`) do not match `.img.org`, indicating conversion issues.

2. **Hexdump Observations**:
   - The "good" image has scattered non-zero data.
   - Converted images have large zero sections, especially early on, suggesting incomplete or incorrect data writes.

3. **Size Issues**:
   - Default APFS conversion results in a smaller file (16MB), which is likely truncated.
   - Using `-S 0` increases size to 8.5GB but still doesn't resolve corruption.

### Solution Steps:

1. **Verify Conversion Tools and Parameters**:
   - Ensure you're using the correct tool for APFS conversion, such as `apfsdisktool`.
   - Check if specific parameters are needed for proper image handling, like specifying the exact output size with `-s` or `-size`.

2. **Use Correct Command Syntax**:
   If using a command-line tool, ensure it's properly formatted to handle the input and output sizes correctly. For example:
   ```bash
   apfsdisktool -c -s 8589934592 your_image.bin your_output.apfs
   ```
   Replace `8589934592` with the correct size in bytes (e.g., 8GB is 8,589,934,592 bytes).

3. **Check for Data Integrity**:
   After conversion, verify the output image using checksums or comparison tools against `.img.org`.

4. **Alternative Tools**:
   If issues persist, consider using alternative tools like `dd` to copy the disk and then convert with APFS utilities.

5. **Consult Documentation**:
   Refer to Apple's documentation or community resources for proper APFS image creation guidelines.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue is likely improper handling of the image size during conversion, leading to truncated or corrupted files. By ensuring correct parameters and using appropriate tools, you can achieve a successful and accurate conversion that matches your original disk image.
