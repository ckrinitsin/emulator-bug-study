Okay, I'm trying to figure out why my QEMU setup with MIPS SMP isn't working properly. The error message mentions something about an assertion failing in `cpu_hotplug_hw_init` and a kernel panic related to the stack protector. Also, when I try using more cores, it doesn't seem to help.

First, let me look at the resources mentioned. There are some old emails from 2013 indicating that support for SMP on MIPS might be limited or not fully functional in QEMU. Another link suggests that only certain CPUs work, like the I6400, but even newer versions don't seem to function well.

I'm using Debian's images for MIPS, specifically `vmlinux-4.19.0-10-4kc-malta` and an initrd. The hardware I'm emulating is a MIPS 1004Kc V2.15 with four cores. When I run QEMU with `-smp 4`, it crashes, but sometimes getting further when using more memory up to 12 cores.

I wonder if `-smp` is the correct option for enabling multiple CPUs in this context. Maybe there's a different way to configure SMP in QEMU for MIPS systems. Alternatively, perhaps the Debian kernel doesn't fully support the required features for SMP in emulation.

Looking at the error message, it mentions `cpu_hotplug_hw_init` and an assertion failure. This makes me think that the CPU hotplugging functionality isn't working as expected, possibly due to a missing or incorrect configuration in QEMU.

I should check if there are any known issues with QEMU's MIPS SMP support in newer versions. The user mentioned trying QEMU 5.0, but maybe it's better to look into whether there have been any recent changes or patches that address this issue.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is related to how the kernel handles multiple CPUs during boot. The stack protector error suggests a deeper issue with the kernel's handling of the CPU cores in the emulated environment.

I should also verify if the MIPS 1004Kc V2.15 CPU model is supported for SMP in QEMU and if there are any specific configurations needed, such as using certain machine types or additional QEMU options.

Maybe I can try a different approach by setting up a minimal environment with a newer kernel version to see if the issue persists. Alternatively, reaching out to the QEMU community or checking their bug tracker might provide more insight into whether this is a known problem and if there are any ongoing efforts to fix it.

To address the issues with running QEMU's MIPS SMP emulation, consider the following structured approach:

1. **Verify QEMU Configuration**: Ensure that `-smp` is correctly used or explore alternative configuration options for enabling multiple CPUs in QEMU for MIPS systems.

2. **Check CPU and Kernel Support**: Confirm that the MIPS 1004Kc V2.15 CPU model supports SMP in your version of QEMU and that the Debian kernel includes necessary SMP patches for emulation environments.

3. **Update QEMU and Kernel**: Look into newer versions of QEMU, such as 5.0 or later, to see if the issue has been resolved with recent updates. Consider using a more recent Linux kernel from Debian's repositories to check for improved support.

4. **Report Issues**: If the problem persists, document your findings and reach out to the QEMU community through forums, mailing lists, or their bug tracker. Provide details about your setup and error messages to help identify potential fixes.

By systematically exploring these steps, you can determine whether the issue lies with configuration, software versioning, or requires further community support for resolution.
