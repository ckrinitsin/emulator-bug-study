Okay, so I'm trying to help someone who's having trouble building QEMU 2.0.0 on their system using the rpmbuild tool. They've encountered some issues with dependencies and also a problem during the build process related to SeaBIOS. Let me break down what's happening here.

First, the user mentioned they're using OpenSUSE, probably Tumbleweed or Leap, since they're using zypper for package management. They tried installing QEMU from sources by running `zypper source-install qemu`, which I think fetches the source RPM packages. Then, they updated libusb to version 1.0.18 from a debug repository. That's probably because they need USB passthrough in QEMU, and maybe an older version of libusb doesn't support that feature.

Next, they removed a version check in qemu.spec related to --enable-libusb. So, they were trying to ensure that when building QEMU, it includes the libusb support. But when they ran `rpmbuild -bb`, they got dependency errors: libusb-devel and xen-devel were missing. They noted that xen-devel was already installed, but libusb-devel wasn't, even though they had libusb-1_0-devel installed.

So, I think there's a package naming issue here. In OpenSUSE, the development packages might be named differently. Instead of `libusb-devel`, it's possible that `libusb-1_0-devel` is the correct name. The user tried modifying the qemu.spec to require `libusb-1_0-devel` instead, which seems to have worked because the build process started recognizing the include path.

However, after fixing the libusb dependency, they ran into another issue during the SeaBIOS build. The error message says there's no such file or directory for `acpi-dsdt.lst`, leading to a failure in compiling the AML output. This seems specific to the SeaBIOS part of QEMU.

Looking at the user's later update, they mentioned that someone else tried this with the latest QEMU (2.10.0) on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and it worked fine. So, maybe their issue was due to an older version of QEMU or some missing dependencies that were fixed in newer versions.

I'm thinking that perhaps the SeaBIOS build process has some issues that are resolved in later QEMU releases. Alternatively, there might have been a bug in the specific version they're trying to build (2.0.0) which was fixed in subsequent updates.

Since the user is now reporting that everything works with the latest QEMU and OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, it's likely that this ticket can be closed as it's no longer an issue. The problems they encountered were specific to an older version of the software, and newer versions have addressed these issues.

The issue described has been resolved in newer versions of QEMU and OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. Therefore, the ticket can be closed.

**Answer:**

The problem was related to an older version of QEMU (2.0.0) and OpenSUSE. With the latest updates, specifically using QEMU 2.10.0 on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, the issues have been resolved. Thus, this ticket can be closed as it is no longer applicable.

**Final Answer:**

The issue has been resolved in newer versions of QEMU and OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. Therefore, the ticket can be closed.
