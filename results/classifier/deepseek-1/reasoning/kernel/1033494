Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned that when using qemu-system-x86_64 with a kernel version 3.5.0, it segfaults while installing Ubuntu. They also noted that with a different kernel (RHEL 6's 2.6.32), qemu-kvm runs fine.

The issue occurs during the installation process and is reproducible. The user provided backtraces but they're expired now. However, they linked to a thread discussing the same problem and suggested applying a specific fix from that thread.

Looking at the categories provided: I see options like kernel, hypervisor, device, etc. Since this involves QEMU's interaction with the host kernel causing a segfault during VM setup, it likely relates to the kernel module or how QEMU interfaces with the kernel.

The user is using qemu-system-x86_64, which is part of QEMU but also interacts closely with the hypervisor (KVM in this case). The issue seems to be related to KVM's interaction with the host's newer kernel. So possible categories could be 'hypervisor' or 'kernel'.

Since the problem arises when using a specific kernel version, it points towards an incompatibility or bug in how QEMU/KVM interacts with that kernel. Therefore, the category 'kernel' seems appropriate as the issue lies within the interaction between QEMU and the host's kernel.
