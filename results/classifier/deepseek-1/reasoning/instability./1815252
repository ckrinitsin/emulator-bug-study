Alright, let me try to figure out what's going on here. I'm seeing some error messages from a kernel log, but it seems like the user is having trouble with their system after compiling a new kernel without 9p support.

First, looking at the logs:

- There are several lines about memory regions being usable or reserved, which probably aren't too critical unless they're causing issues.
- Then there's an error: "acpiphp_ibm: ibm_acpiphp_init: acpi_walk_namespace failed". I'm not entirely sure what that means, but it might be related to hardware ACPI initialization. Maybe a driver issue?
- Next, the user tried starting `bpfilter` and got some errors about terminal process groups. That seems like a shell-related problem, perhaps because they're in an environment without proper job control.
- Then, when trying to use `grep` on `/proc/cpuinfo`, it says the file doesn't exist. Wait, that's odd because `/proc/cpuinfo` should be there unless something is seriously wrong with the proc filesystem.

Then comes a detailed log of system calls during `passwd`. It looks like they were trying to change their password but got stuck at `fsync(4 <- hung here)`. So the process is hanging, which could mean a problem with file operations or permissions. Maybe an issue with how `/etc/shadow` is being handled.

The user also mentioned compiling a kernel without 9p support, so they had to use a specific config. That might have caused some issues if other parts of the system rely on 9p. Could that be related to why the `passwd` command is failing?

Then there's a note about QEMU considering moving bug tracking systems and marking old bugs as incomplete or expired. It seems like they're part of a larger project issue, possibly unrelated to the immediate problem.

Putting it all together: The user compiled a new kernel without 9p support, which might have introduced some instability. When trying to run `passwd`, it's failing with file-related errors and hanging at fsync. The lack of `/proc/cpuinfo` is worrying because that file should exist in most Linux systems; maybe the proc filesystem isn't mounted correctly or there's a kernel issue preventing it from being generated.

Possible steps to fix:

1. **Check Kernel Configuration**: Ensure that when compiling without 9p support, all necessary configurations are set correctly. Maybe some modules weren't built or included properly.

2. **Inspect Proc Filesystem**: Verify if `/proc` is mounted and functioning. Try `mount | grep proc` to see if it's mounted. If not, remount it with `mount -t proc proc /proc`.

3. **Filesystem Permissions**: The errors during `passwd` suggest file handling issues. Check the permissions on `/etc/shadow` and other relevant files. Maybe they're owned by the wrong user or have incorrect permissions.

4. **ACPI Issues**: The ACPI error might be a red herring, but it's worth checking if the hardware is being detected properly. Maybe disable some ACPI features in the kernel config to see if that helps.

5. **Reinstall Systemd or Shell Utilities**: If the shell isn't handling job control correctly, maybe there's an issue with systemd or the init system. Reinstalling necessary packages could resolve this.

6. **Check Logs for More Details**: Look into `/var/log` files for more clues about what's causing the hang during `passwd`.

7. **Revert to a Working Kernel**: If all else fails, boot back into a known-good kernel version to stabilize the system and then troubleshoot from there.

I'm not entirely sure if compiling without 9p support would cause these specific issues, but it seems like the kernel changes introduced some instability. Maybe certain subsystems rely on 9p even indirectly, or the configuration missed some necessary components.

The user is experiencing a series of system errors after compiling a new kernel without 9p support. The key issues include:

1. **Kernel Configuration**: Compiling without 9p support might have led to missing modules or improper hardware detection, causing ACPI and filesystem issues.

2. **Proc Filesystem Issues**: The absence of `/proc/cpuinfo` suggests the proc filesystem may not be mounted correctly, which could prevent essential system operations.

3. **Filesystem Permissions and Integrity**: Errors during `passwd` indicate potential file handling problems, possibly due to incorrect permissions or a corrupted filesystem.

4. **ACPI Initialization Failure**: This might be related to hardware detection issues in the new kernel.

**Recommendations:**

- **Verify Proc Mount**: Check if `/proc` is mounted with `mount | grep proc`. If not, remount it.
  
- **Check Filesystem Health**: Use tools like `fsck` to ensure filesystem integrity and correct permissions on critical files like `/etc/shadow`.

- **Inspect Kernel Logs**: Look for more detailed errors in logs located in `/var/log/` to pinpoint the cause of the hang during `passwd`.

- **Revert Kernel if Necessary**: If issues persist, boot with a known-good kernel version to stabilize the system.

By addressing these areas, the user can identify and resolve the underlying issues causing the system instability.
