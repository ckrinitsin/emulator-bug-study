Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why my QEMU setup is causing issues when booting AIX 7.1 and older versions. The error message I keep getting is about an "Unimplemented SPAPR hcall 0x00000000000002b8" which is mentioned multiple times during the boot process, followed by a crash with an "Illegal Trap Instruction Interrupt in Kernel". 

From what I understand, this error is related to a hypercall (hcall) that QEMU doesn't implement. The hcall 0x2b8 seems to be associated with Partition Energy Management (PEM), as mentioned in section 14.14 of LoPAPR. It looks like QEMU doesn't support PEM for these older AIX versions, which might be causing the system to crash.

I tried running QEMU version 6.0.0 with a Power8 CPU and configured it to use VirtIO SCSI for disk access. My command line includes various options like setting up the machine type as pseries, specifying max-cpu-compat=power7, allocating 4GB of memory, enabling debugging for unimplemented instructions, and attaching the install ISO along with a QCOW2 image.

The user David mentioned that this issue also affects him when using QEMU 6.0.0, so it's not just my setup but possibly a known problem with older AIX versions on QEMU. The suggestion was to try AIX 7.2 instead since there might be support for VirtIO or other necessary components in newer versions.

I'm a bit confused because I thought that QEMU should support a wider range of guest operating systems, including older ones like AIX 7.1. Maybe the lack of VirtIO support is causing the system to not boot properly, leading to those hypercall errors and ultimately the kernel crash.

Looking into the LoPAPR documentation might help. Section 14.14 talks about the Partition Energy Management (PEM) interface, which includes several hcalls. If QEMU doesn't implement these, it makes sense that newer AIX versions would handle this differently or perhaps not require them as much. However, older versions like 7.1 might rely on these hypercalls more, leading to crashes when they're missing.

I'm also thinking about how VirtIO interacts with the system. VirtIO is a paravirtualization interface that allows devices in a virtual machine to be accessed without emulation, which can improve performance and compatibility. If AIX 7.1 doesn't have VirtIO support built-in, then using a VirtIO device like virtio-scsi-pci might not work correctly with QEMU.

Maybe I need to find another way to attach the disk that doesn't rely on VirtIO. Perhaps using a different machine type or a different method for attaching storage could help. Or maybe there are specific QEMU options or configurations that can bypass the need for these unimplemented hypercalls.

Another angle is checking if there have been any updates or patches in QEMU that address this issue for older AIX versions. The user mentioned an existing ticket for AIX 7.2, but I'm not sure if fixes have been applied for older versions as well.

In summary, the main issues seem to be:
1. Unimplemented hcall 0x2b8 related to PEM in QEMU.
2. Potential lack of VirtIO support in older AIX versions, leading to device attachment problems.

To resolve this, I might need to either:
- Upgrade to AIX 7.2 if possible, which may have better compatibility with QEMU and VirtIO.
- Find a different method for attaching the disk that doesn't use VirtIO, maybe through another device type or configuration.
- Check if there are any patches or updates in QEMU that address these issues for older AIX versions.

I'm also considering reaching out to the QEMU community or forums to see if others have encountered similar problems and how they resolved them. Maybe there's a workaround or a specific setup that can make this work without relying on the unimplemented hypercalls.

The issue arises when using QEMU to boot older AIX versions (7.1, 6.1) due to an unimplemented SPAPR hypercall (0x2b8), which is related to Partition Energy Management (PEM). Additionally, VirtIO support might not be available in these older AIX versions, leading to device configuration issues.

**Solution:**
1. **Upgrade to AIX 7.2:** This version may include improvements for compatibility with QEMU and VirtIO.
2. **Alternative Disk Attachment Method:** Avoid using VirtIO by configuring the disk through a different method compatible with older AIX versions.
3. **Check QEMU Updates:** Look for patches or updates in QEMU that address these issues, especially for older AIX support.
