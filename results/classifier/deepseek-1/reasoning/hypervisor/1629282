Alright, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The user is experiencing an issue where their QEMU machine hangs when installing Windows 7 as a guest using OVMF BIOS. They provided the command-line arguments they're using and mentioned that switching to a more recent OVMF build from kraxel.org resolved the problem.

Looking at the details, the hang occurs during installation, specifically when using an older version of OVMF. The user also mentions issues with how the variable store is set up and suggests correcting the display option to '-vga std'. 

The key points here are that it's related to the BIOS (OVMF) and the setup of the virtual machine's firmware. Since the issue arises from using an outdated OVMF version, it likely pertains to how the hypervisor or the underlying QEMU configuration interacts with the firmware during boot. 

Given that OVMF is part of the EDK2 project used for UEFI in QEMU and this relates to the machine's boot process, the category that fits best here is 'hypervisor'. This is because OVMF operates as a firmware layer within the virtual machine, interacting with the hypervisor (like KVM) to manage the boot process.
