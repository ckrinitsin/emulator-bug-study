Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the predefined categories. Let's read through the bug report carefully.

The user is discussing how QEMU handles certain signals like SIGQUIT, SIGINT, SIGHUP, and SIGTERM. They want QEMU to send an ACPI shutdown to the guest before exiting when receiving a signal. The main issue seems to be about how signals are handled to initiate a graceful shutdown of the virtual machine.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report is focused on signal handling in QEMU. It's about modifying how certain signals trigger guest shutdowns rather than issues with translations or low-level components like devices or graphics. Since the discussion revolves around system-level signals and their processing within QEMU, which manages virtual machines (hypervisors), it relates to the hypervisor category.

The user suggests using SIGHUP as an alternative to SIGQUIT for initiating a clean shutdown, implying this is a feature request or bug fix related to how the hypervisor handles signals. Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'hypervisor'.
