Alright, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the information provided.

The user mentioned that after switching to meson, 'make help' doesn't list various targets anymore. They included a diff showing changes in the output of 'make help'. The main issue seems to be missing target options when using meson compared to the previous setup with automake.

Looking at the categories: build-system, documentation, test, user-interface, other.

This is about the output generated by 'make help' which is related to how make targets are displayed. Since it's an issue with the build system (meson vs automake), the appropriate category would be "build-system".

Wait, but in the diff provided, it's more about what targets are shown rather than the build process itself. However, since meson is a build system generator, any issues arising from using it fall under build-system.

So yes, I think 'build-system' is the right classification here.

The bug report discusses an issue with the `make help` output after switching to Meson, which affects how targets are displayed. Since this relates to the build system (Meson) and not the build process itself, it's best categorized as:

**Classification:**
- **build-system**

This classification is appropriate because the problem stems from changes in the build system (Meson) affecting target visibility.
