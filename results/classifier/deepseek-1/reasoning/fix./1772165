Okay, I'm trying to get USB devices like a keyboard and mouse working in my QEMU setup for emulating a Raspberry Pi on Windows 10. Here's what I've done so far:

I downloaded the precompiled 64-bit QEMU executables from [https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/](https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/) because I'm using Windows, and that's what they suggested for Windows targets.

When I run the emulator with the command:

```
qemu-system-arm -M raspi2b -drive file=2020-12-02-raspios-buster-armhf.img,format=raw,if=sd -dtb qemu-rpi-kernel\native-emuation\dtbs\bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb -kernel qemu-rpi-kernel\native-emuation\kernels\kernel7.img -append "rw earlycon=pl011,0x3f201000 console=ttyAMA0 loglevel=8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 fsck.repair=yes net.ifnames=0 rootwait memtest=1 dwc_otg.fiq_fsm_enable=0" -serial stdio -no-reboot -netdev user,id=net0 -usb -device usb-kbd -device usb-tablet -device usb-net,netdev=net0
```

The emulator starts, and I can see the Raspberry Pi desktop. However, my external USB keyboard and mouse aren't working. The only way to interact with the system is through the serial terminal provided by QEMU.

I know that QEMU has USB emulation starting from version 5.1, which was mentioned in a previous email. Since I'm using version 6.2.0, which is newer than 5.1, it should support USB devices. But why isn't it working for me on Windows?

Let me think about possible reasons:

1. **USB Configuration Issues**: Maybe the way I'm adding the USB devices in the command line is incorrect. On Linux, people use `-usbdevice` or similar options, but on Windows with this build, perhaps the syntax is different.

2. **Device Drivers**: Could there be a problem with how QEMU emulates USB devices on Windows? Maybe certain drivers aren't being loaded properly, or the host's USB drivers are interfering.

3. **QEMU Configuration for Windows**: Since I'm using a precompiled version for Windows, perhaps some features aren't enabled or configured correctly in this build compared to the Linux versions.

4. **Kernel Parameters**: The kernel parameters might not be set up correctly. For example, if `dwc_otg.fiq_fsm_enable=0` is supposed to enable the USB controller, maybe it's conflicting with something else.

5. **Host System Conflicts**: Maybe other software or drivers on my Windows machine are causing the USB devices to not pass through properly.

6. **QEMU Version Limitations**: Although I'm using a newer version, perhaps there's a known issue in QEMU 6.2.0 related to USB emulation on Windows that hasn't been fixed yet.

To troubleshoot:

- **Check Logs**: Maybe QEMU is outputting some error messages when starting up regarding the USB devices. If I can capture those logs, it might give me more insight into what's going wrong.

- **Minimal Setup Test**: Try running QEMU with just the basic setup and add USB devices one by one to see if any of them cause issues.

- **Alternative Builds**: Maybe try a different version of QEMU for Windows or compile QEMU myself from source to see if it works with my current setup.

I also remember that sometimes, certain USB devices require specific configurations in the guest OS. For example, maybe I need to install additional drivers or configure permissions in Raspberry Pi's settings to allow access to the USB devices.

Another thought: perhaps the `-usb` option isn't sufficient on Windows and needs additional parameters. Maybe I should specify a host USB device using something like `-usbdevice keyboard` or similar?

Wait, looking back at my command line, I have `-usb`, which enables USB emulation, and then adds specific devices with `-device usb-kbd` and `-device usb-tablet`. So that seems correct.

But in some QEMU configurations, you need to use `-usbhost` or specify the device differently. Maybe I should look into how others have configured USB on Windows with QEMU for Raspberry Pi.

I also wonder if there's a way to test the USB support by using a different USB device, like a storage drive, to see if that mounts correctly in the guest OS. If that works, then maybe the issue is specific to keyboard and mouse.

Perhaps I can try connecting an external hard drive via USB and see if it appears in `/dev` inside the Raspberry Pi image. That might help isolate whether the USB subsystem is working at all.

Additionally, checking QEMU's documentation for Windows-specific issues with USB devices could provide clues. Maybe there are known workarounds or specific steps needed on Windows to enable USB device passthrough.

To resolve the issue of USB devices not working in your QEMU setup for Raspberry Pi on Windows 10, follow these troubleshooting steps:

### Step-by-Step Explanation and Solution

1. **Verify QEMU Command Line Options**:
   - Ensure that you're using the correct syntax for adding USB devices. The command includes `-usb`, which enables USB emulation, followed by specific device configurations with `-device`. Your current setup seems correct.

2. **Check QEMU Logs for Errors**:
   - Run QEMU from a command prompt to capture any error messages when starting up or during USB device interaction. Look for lines related to USB devices or drivers.

3. **Test with Minimal Setup**:
   - Start QEMU with the basic configuration and add one USB device at a time (e.g., keyboard first) to isolate if any specific device is causing the issue.

4. **Check Host System Conflicts**:
   - Ensure no other software is conflicting with USB device access. Antivirus or system monitoring tools might block USB device emulation.

5. **Update QEMU Version**:
   - Consider downloading a newer version of QEMU for Windows, as some issues might have been resolved in later releases. Alternatively, compile QEMU from source if needed.

6. **Test with Alternative USB Devices**:
   - Use an external storage device to check if it mounts correctly in the guest OS. This helps determine if the USB subsystem is functioning at all.

7. **Consult Documentation and Forums**:
   - Refer to QEMU's documentation for Windows-specific issues and forums where others might have encountered similar problems. Look for workarounds or known solutions.

8. **Enable USB Host Support**:
   - Some configurations require using `-usbhost` instead of `-usb`. Experiment with this option if your current setup isn't working.

9. **Guest OS Configuration**:
   - Ensure the guest OS (Raspberry Pi) has proper USB driver support and permissions to access the devices. Check for any needed updates or driver installations in the guest system.

10. **Alternative Builds**:
    - If using a precompiled version doesn't work, try compiling QEMU from source yourself to see if it resolves the issue on your setup.

By systematically testing each component and reviewing logs, you can identify where the USB devices are failing and apply the appropriate fix.
