Okay, so I'm trying to compile QEMU on my Arch Linux system using the ABS system. I followed some steps where I created a PKGBUILD file and included some configuration options. When I ran the configure script with those options, it gave me some errors related to Xen components.

Looking at the error messages, they mention issues with 'HVM_PARAM_IOREQ_PFN' and 'HVM_PARAM_BUFIOREQ_PFN' being undeclared. That makes me think that these symbols are part of the Xen hypervisor's API, which QEMU probably uses when compiling support for Xen.

I remember that in the configure script, there was an option to enable or disable Xen support. The user mentioned they added '--disable-xen' to their configuration line. So I'm guessing that without enabling Xen, those symbols aren't available, causing the build to fail because it's trying to include them anyway.

Wait, no—if Xen support is disabled, QEMU shouldn't be trying to compile against Xen libraries or headers. The errors are happening in files related to Xen, like xen_common.h and xen_disk.c. So maybe the issue isn't just about enabling or disabling Xen but also ensuring that the necessary Xen development packages are installed when Xen support is enabled.

But in this case, since the user doesn't use Xen, they decided to disable it. However, their configure command didn't include --disable-xen; instead, they saw the option in the help and added it to their PKGBUILD. After that, the compilation worked.

I think the main takeaway here is that if you don't need Xen support, disabling it can prevent these kinds of errors because QEMU won't attempt to link against or include Xen-related parts. So the user's approach makes sense—they removed the dependency by disabling Xen in the configure options.

If someone else runs into similar issues, they should check their configure command to ensure that optional components like Xen are only enabled if needed. Otherwise, disabling them can resolve build errors related to missing declarations or undefined symbols.

To compile QEMU without encountering Xen-related errors, you should disable Xen support using the `--disable-xen` option in your configure script. Here's how you can do it:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Download QEMU Source Code:**
   - Clone QEMU from its Git repository or download a stable release.

2. **Run the Configure Script:**
   - Navigate to the root directory of the QEMU source code.
   - Execute the configure script with the desired options, including `--disable-xen`.

3. **Example Configure Command:**
   ```bash
   ./configure --prefix=/usr \
              --sysconfdir=/etc \
              --audio-drv-list='pa alsa sdl' \
              --python=/usr/bin/python2 \
              --smbd=/usr/bin/smbd \
              --enable-docs \
              --libexecdir=/usr/lib/qemu \
              --disable-gtk \
              --enable-linux-aio \
              --enable-seccomp \
              --enable-spice \
              --localstatedir=/var \
              --enable-tpm \
              --enable-modules \
              --enable-{rbd,glusterfs,libiscsi,curl} \
              --disable-xen
   ```

4. **Compile QEMU:**
   - After running configure successfully, compile the source using `make`.

5. **Install QEMU (if necessary):**
   - Use `make install` to install QEMU after compilation.

**Answer:**

To compile QEMU without errors related to Xen, use this configure command:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr \
           --sysconfdir=/etc \
           --audio-drv-list='pa alsa sdl' \
           --python=/usr/bin/python2 \
           --smbd=/usr/bin/smbd \
           --enable-docs \
           --libexecdir=/usr/lib/qemu \
           --disable-gtk \
           --enable-linux-aio \
           --enable-seccomp \
           --enable-spice \
           --localstatedir=/var \
           --enable-tpm \
           --enable-modules \
           --enable-{rbd,glusterfs,libiscsi,curl} \
           --disable-xen
```

This command disables Xen support, preventing the build errors related to undeclared identifiers.
