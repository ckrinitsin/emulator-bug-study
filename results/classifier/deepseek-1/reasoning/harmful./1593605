Okay, let me try to break this down. So the user is talking about issues with running Windows 7 as a Hyper-V guest using QEMU and OVMF firmware. From what I gather, there were some problems related to memory allocation and UEFI compatibility.

He mentioned that the issue isn't with QEMU itself but more so with how Windows interacts with the UEFI setup in this environment. There was a reference to a patch that Parallels had used, which suggests that it's been an ongoing problem for a few years.

The main solution seems to be disabling HyperV enlightenments for these Windows 7 UEFI guests, something that virt-manager already does. So if someone is usingvirt-manager or similar tools, they should be fine because the management layer handles this configuration automatically.

I think he's also saying that trying to fix OVMF's VBE shim isn't a good idea since it's already a hack. Instead, relying on higher-level tools like libvirt and virt-manager is better for managing such configurations without running into these issues.

In summary, the key takeaway is that using proper management tools with libvirt and virt-manager will handle the necessary settings to avoid this problem, rather than trying to patch QEMU or OVMF directly. Also, the issue lies more within how Windows interacts with UEFI in this setup rather than any flaw in the hypervisor itself.

The issue described involves running Windows 7 as a Hyper-V guest using QEMU and OVMF firmware, where problems arise due to compatibility issues between the UEFI environment and Windows. The user emphasizes that the problem is not with QEMU but stems from how Windows interacts with UEFI.

**Key Points:**

1. **Problem Identification**: The issue relates to memory allocation in the UEFI setup for Windows 7 guests, specifically involving Hyper-V enlightenments.
   
2. **Solution**: Disabling HyperV enlightenments for these guests resolves the problem. Tools like virt-manager and virt-install automatically handle this configuration.

3. **Patch Information**: A patch exists but isn't widely implemented yet. It was noted that Parallels has used a similar workaround, indicating it's not a new issue.

4. **Recommendation**: Use management tools such as libvirt and its associated utilities (e.g., virt-manager) for setting up guests, as they manage configurations to prevent such issues.

5. **Avoiding Patching OVMF**: Modifying OVMF's VBE shim is discouraged due to the complexity and potential negative impacts on other UEFI-abiding OSes.

6. **Conclusion**: The problem lies in Windows' interaction with UEFI rather than QEMU or Hyper-V itself. Using higher-level management tools simplifies handling these configurations and avoids silent failures.

**Final Answer:**

To resolve the issue of running Windows 7 as a Hyper-V guest under QEMU with OVMF, it is recommended to disable HyperV enlightenments using management tools like libvirt and virt-manager. These tools automatically configure settings to prevent compatibility issues, making manual patching unnecessary and potentially harmful.
