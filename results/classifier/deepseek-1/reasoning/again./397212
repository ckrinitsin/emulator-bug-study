Okay, so I'm trying to understand what's going on here with this bug report about QEMU and VNC issues in Fedora 11. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the user is talking about a problem with QEMU's VNC implementation causing issues in their setup. They've been dealing with this for five months, which is frustrating because it makes using Windows harder, according to them. They mention that they've tried various fixes and workarounds but haven't found anything effective yet.

I see that Mark McLoughlin from the Fedora team has responded several times. Initially, he mentioned a fix in QEMU version 0.10.7, which would be included in an update. He suggests leaving it as is for now and trying to get it fixed properly. If no progress is made soon, he'll revert the change.

The user then asks if pushing a build of the 0.10.7 RC (release candidate) to updates-testing would be a good idea. Mark responds by saying that there are currently no plans to update QEMU in Fedora 11 to version 0.11 due to potential regressions and the complexity of backporting fixes, especially with the significant code changes in VNC-related areas.

The user expresses frustration again ("Bah...") and asks if there's a workaround for the bug or another way to connect to the output besides VNC, mentioning that they've been using virt-manager. Mark suggests running a VNC server inside the guest virtual machine and connecting to that instead of using QEMU's built-in VNC client. However, he notes that this might not be ideal.

Mark then discusses his approach: disabling the CopyRect extension in QEMU-0.10.6-9.fc11 as a workaround. He believes this should fix the issue because, from what he knows, CopyRect works fine in QEMU 0.11.0 for Fedora 12. He asks others to confirm if the update fixes their issues and mentions that they can increase karma on Bodhi (the Fedora update system) once installed.

Several users respond positively, saying the update fixed their problems, including one who tried commenting anonymously but is now seeking help on bumping karma in Bodhi. Mark also provides an update stating that QEMU 0.10.6-9.fc11 has been pushed to the stable repository, and if issues persist, they should note it here.

Now, I need to understand what exactly the problem was and how it was resolved. From the context, the issue seems related to the VNC implementation in QEMU causing problems, possibly with performance or connection issues, making Windows harder to use. The CopyRect extension is part of QEMU's VNC server, used for efficient image transfers. If it's broken, disabling it might revert to a different method that works better.

Mark's solution was to disable the CopyRect encoding in the QEMU build provided, which suggests that this encoding wasn't functioning correctly and caused issues when enabled. By removing it, they're forcing QEMU to use an alternative method for VNC communication, which doesn't have the same problems.

The user also asked about workarounds other than using VNC, like virt-manager. Virt-manager is a graphical tool for managing virtual machines, but if that's not working, maybe using another VNC client or a different approach (like SSH tunneling) could be an alternative. But Mark suggested running a VNC server inside the guest, which would be a workaround but might not always be feasible.

The main resolution here was to disable CopyRect in the QEMU build for Fedora 11. This indicates that the problem was traced back to an issue with how the CopyRect extension was implemented or handled in version 0.10.6 of QEMU, and disabling it resolved the user's issues without needing to update to a newer QEMU version.

In summary, the bug involved problems with QEMU's VNC server due to a faulty implementation of the CopyRect extension. The solution was to disable this extension in the specific QEMU package for Fedora 11, which fixed the issue for affected users.
</think>

The issue reported was related to problems with QEMU's VNC server in version 0.10.6, specifically due to a faulty implementation of the CopyRect extension. This caused difficulties when using Windows guests, making it harder to use them effectively.

**Solution:**
Mark McLoughlin resolved this by disabling the CopyRect encoding in QEMU-0.10.6-9.fc11 for Fedora 11. Disabling this extension reverted QEMU to an alternative VNC communication method that didn't have the same issues, thereby fixing the problem without needing to update to a newer QEMU version.

**Outcome:**
The fix was pushed to the stable repository, and users confirmed that it resolved their issues, making Windows guests more usable again.
