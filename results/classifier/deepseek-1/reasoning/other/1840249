Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through it carefully.

The user reported that cancelling 'make docker-test-build' with Ctrl+C doesn't stop the running containers. They ran the command and then pressed ^C, but when they checked with 'docker ps', all containers were still running.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue here is about how Make and Docker are interacting when interrupted. 'make docker-test-build' runs Docker containers as part of the build process. When Ctrl+C is pressed, it's supposed to stop execution, but apparently, it doesn't affect the running containers.

This isn't related to translation issues (mistranslation), assembly code, or any specific hardware component like network devices or graphics. It's also not about permissions or performance directly. The problem lies in how the Make process interacts with Docker and whether it properly signals Docker to stop the containers when interrupted.

Since none of the listed categories fit perfectly except possibly 'other', but let me think again. Maybe it relates more to how the build system handles Docker containers, which could fall under 'build' processes or perhaps 'debugging' if it's about how interrupts are handled. However, in the given list, 'boot' might be relevant because the issue is about starting (booting) containers that don't stop properly when interrupted.

Wait, noâ€”'boot' usually refers to system startup. Maybe 'kernel'? Or perhaps 'hypervisor' since Docker uses a hypervisor-like environment? Alternatively, maybe it's an issue with how the Make command handles cancellation, which could be under 'debug'.

But considering all options, none seem to fit perfectly except possibly 'other'. Because the main problem is that interrupting the build process doesn't stop the running containers. This seems more like a process management or signal handling issue in the build script.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to how Make sends signals; maybe it should send a SIGINT to all child processes, but it's not doing so correctly. However, since this isn't about any specific component listed, 'other' is the safest bet.

The bug report describes an issue where cancelling the 'make docker-test-build' command with ^C does not stop the running Docker containers. The problem lies in how the build process interacts with Docker when interrupted. Since the categories provided don't directly address this behavior, which seems related to process management or signal handling in the build script, the appropriate classification is:

**other**
