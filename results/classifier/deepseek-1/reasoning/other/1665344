Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The bug report mentions a documentation error where certain URLs are returning 404 not found. Specifically, the user is trying to access Q35.pdf and PCIvsPCIe.pdf from the QEMU wiki page, but these links are broken. They also mentioned that the links have been updated on the wiki.

Looking at the categories, I need to see which one fits best. The issue here isn't related to any specific component of QEMU like networking or graphics. It's about documentation, specifically URLs pointing to images that don't exist anymore. 

The category 'other' is meant for issues that don't fit into the other specific ones. Since this is a documentation problem and not related to the core functionalities like device emulation, network setup, or hypervisor features, it doesn't fall under any of those categories. Therefore, 'other' seems appropriate.
