Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report about QEMU. Let me go through it step by step.

The user reports that when building QEMU with parallel make and including --save-temps in the extra C flags, the build fails. They provided details about their setup: using Archlinux with a Linux kernel, compiling for RISC-V, and encountering errors related to trace functions not being declared correctly.

Looking at the error messages, it seems like there are issues with trace file generation when using --save-temps. The user found that removing --save-temps or replacing it with -save-temps=obj fixes the problem. 

The key point here is that --save-temps causes temporary files to be placed in a way that conflicts during parallel builds, leading to overwrites and build failures. This isn't related to any specific component like device drivers, graphics, or networking. Instead, it's about how the build process handles temporary files when compiling multiple sources concurrently.

So, considering the categories given: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, etc.â€”this issue doesn't fall under those. It's more about the build system and how temporary files are managed during compilation. Since there's no specific category that matches this exactly, "other" seems appropriate.

The bug report discusses issues with parallel builds failing when using `--save-temps` due to conflicting temporary files. This isn't related to any specific component but rather the build process.

**Answer: other**
