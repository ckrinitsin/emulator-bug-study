Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned that when using the new `-netdev` option in QEMU with `tap,id=ids_e0`, the tap interface created is named `tap0` instead of `ids_e0`. They compared it to an older syntax where `-net tap,ifname=ids_e0` worked correctly.

From their message, they're confused because they expected the `id` specified in `-netdev` to set the tap device's name. However, according to the response provided, the `id` is just an internal identifier within QEMU and doesn't affect the actual tap interface name on the host. They also mentioned that the correct usage requires specifying both `id` and `ifname`, which suggests that the current behavior is intended.

So, this isn't a bug because the issue arises from a misunderstanding of how `-netdev` works. The user expected `id=ids_e0` to set the tap name, but it's actually supposed to be used with `ifname`. Therefore, there's no error in QEMU; it's just documentation or user knowledge that might need clarification.

Since this isn't a bug related to any specific category like network device issues or incorrect mappings, the correct classification is "other."

The issue described does not qualify as a bug but rather a misunderstanding of how the `-netdev` option works. The `id` parameter sets an internal identifier within QEMU and doesn't affect the tap interface name on the host. Therefore, it's not classified under any specific category.
