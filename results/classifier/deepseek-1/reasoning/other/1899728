Alright, let's break down this bug report to classify it correctly.

The user built QEMU-5.1.0 from source on CentOS 8 using specific commands. After installation, they tried to access the man page for 'qemu-system-x86_64' but got a "No manual entry found" error. 

Initially, the issue was that the man pages weren't being built because Sphinx wasn't installed, which is required since QEMU 5.0. The user didn't have the necessary dependencies, so the docs weren't generated during build time.

The solution involved two steps: installing the required packages (like Sphinx) and reconfiguring the build with --enable-docs to ensure the man pages are built. Once done, running 'man qemu' worked because there's a shared man page for all QEMU system binaries.

So, this bug is related to missing dependencies during the build process, specifically around documentation generation. The main issue was that the user wasn't building the man pages correctly due to not having Sphinx installed. 

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, etc., none directly relate to documentation or build configuration issues. However, since the problem stems from the build process and missing dependencies needed for documentation, it doesn't fit into any of the specific technical categories like network or KVM. Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'other' because it's a build-time issue related to enabling documentation which isn't covered by other specific categories.

The bug report deals with the absence of man pages after building QEMU without the necessary documentation dependencies. It falls under a build-time configuration issue rather than any specific technical category provided, so the appropriate classification is:
