Okay, so I need to classify this bug report based on the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

Looking at the bug report, the user is pointing out that all QEMU target binaries share the same man page, which is primarily focused on x86. This means that for targets like ARM, PowerPC, or s390x, the information in the man pages is incorrect or irrelevant. They suggest having target-specific man pages with common options factored out so each target can have its own documentation.

The main issue here is about documentation being incorrect or outdated for non-x86 architectures. It's not a bug related to code translation (mistranslation) or assembly lowering. It also doesn't fall under any specific categories like device, graphic, network, etc., because it's more about the documentation structure and accuracy.

The problem isn't with how QEMU handles hardware devices, graphics, networking, or hypervisors, but rather that the user documentation is not tailored to different targets. Therefore, this bug report doesn't fit into any of the specific categories provided except for "other," which is meant for issues that don't fall into the predefined ones.

So, the category should be "other."

The bug report addresses incorrect or outdated documentation affecting multiple architectures beyond x86, making it not fit into the specific categories. 

**category:** other
