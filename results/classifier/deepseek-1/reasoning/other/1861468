Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report about QEMU failing to build statically on an Android platform using Ubuntu-devel 20.04 ARM64 with GCC 9.2.1. The user has tried building various QEMU versions from 2.11 to 4.2.0 without success.

Looking at the categories provided, I see options like mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user's issue is about static compilation. They attempted to build QEMU statically but encountered problems with libraries like SDL2 not being detected and linker errors when trying to link executables due to missing static libraries such as libgtk3, libdrm, and libsystemd.

From the context, this isn't related to assembly translation issues (mistranslation) or specific components like graphic drivers (graphic), network, or KVM. The problem seems more about the build process itselfâ€”specifically linking static libraries, which falls under build configuration rather than a particular component category.

Static building requires all dependencies to be available as static libraries. If any dependency isn't found in static form, the build fails. This is an issue related to how the project is being built, not a specific feature or subsystem of QEMU itself.

Since the user is encountering issues during the build process with linking, and it's not tied to a specific category like network or devices but rather the overall build configuration and dependencies, the appropriate category would be 'other'. This is because it doesn't neatly fit into the other provided categories and is more about build setup and static libraries.

The bug report discusses issues encountered while attempting to build QEMU statically. The main problems are missing static library versions for dependencies like SDL2, libgtk3, etc., which cause linking errors during the build process. Since this issue relates to the build configuration and static linking rather than a specific feature or component within QEMU, it doesn't fit into any of the more specific categories provided. Therefore, the appropriate category is:
