Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get my USB devices working in a QEMU/KVM virtual machine. From what I understand, there are different ways to handle USB in QEMU, especially when dealing with older and newer versions of the USB standards.

First, I remember that QEMU uses something called the "usb" and "usb2" options for emulating USB controllers. USB 1.1 devices might need a different setup than USB 2.0 or 3.0 devices. The user mentioned using "-usb" which creates a PIIX3 USB controller, but maybe that's not the right one for all cases.

I saw in the comments that someone suggested using "xhci" instead of "ehci". I think EHCI is for USB 2.0 and OHCI/PIIX3 is for USB 1.1. So if I'm using a device that requires USB 2.0 or 3.0, I might need to use the xhci controller.

Another point was about using a configuration file like "ich9-ehci-uhci.cfg". This file seems important because it tells QEMU how to configure the USB controllers properly. The user mentioned that this file is included in QEMU 2.0, but maybe not all users are aware of its existence or where to find it.

I also noticed that some users were using Virt Viewer and Spice for USB redirection, which worked for them. So perhaps setting up USB through the graphical interface might be easier than editing command-line arguments each time.

The user asked if this is more about configuration rather than a bug. It seems like once you know the right flags and configurations to use, it works fine. Maybe the issue was just about documentation or ease of setup.

In summary, I think the key steps are:
1. Determine which USB controller (EHCI for USB 2.0, XHCI for USB 3.0) your guest OS needs.
2. Use the appropriate QEMU flags when starting the VM.
3. Make sure to include any necessary configuration files if they're needed for proper device setup.
4. Consider using Virt Viewer's USB redirection feature if available.

I should probably test these steps myself to see which works best, but overall, it seems like a matter of correct configuration rather than a bug in QEMU itself.

The issue you're encountering with USB devices in your QEMU/KVM virtual machine is primarily related to proper configuration rather than a bug. Here's how to address it effectively:

1. **Identify the USB Controller**: 
   - Use `EHCI` for USB 2.0 devices.
   - Use `XHCI` for USB 3.0 devices.

2. **Use Appropriate QEMU Flags**:
   - For EHCI: Include `-device usb-ehci,id=usb,bus=pci.0,addr=0x4`.
   - For XHCI: Include `-device usb-xhci`.

3. **Configuration File**: 
   - Utilize the `ich9-ehci-uhci.cfg` configuration file if necessary for proper USB controller setup.

4. **USB Redirection**:
   - Use Virt Viewer's USB redirection feature for a user-friendly approach without command-line edits.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure your QEMU/KVM setup correctly, ensuring USB devices function as expected. This solution focuses on configuration rather than fixing a bug in QEMU itself.
