OpenJDK JVM segfaults on qemu-sh4 (regression)

Some of the recent changes introduced a regression which makes the OpenJDK JVM crash on qemu-sh4:

(sid-sh4-sbuild)root@nofan:/# java -version
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
Segmentation fault
(sid-sh4-sbuild)root@nofan:/#

An older version works fine:

(sid-sh4-sbuild)root@nofan:/# java -version
openjdk version "9.0.1"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 9.0.1+11-Debian-1)
OpenJDK Zero VM (build 9.0.1+11-Debian-1, interpreted mode)
(sid-sh4-sbuild)root@nofan:/#

Haven't had time for bisecting this yet.
