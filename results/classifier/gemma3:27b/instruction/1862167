Specification of ARMv8-A SVE extention allows various values ​​for the size of the SVE register. On the other hand, it seems that the current qemu-aarch64 supports only the maximum length of 2048 bits as the SVE register size. I am writing an assembler program for a CPU that is compliant with ARMv8-A + SVE and has a 512-bit SVE register, but when this is run with qemu-user-aarch64, a 2048-bit load / store instruction is executed This causes a segmentation fault. Shouldn't qeum-user-aarch64 have an option to specify the SVE register size?
