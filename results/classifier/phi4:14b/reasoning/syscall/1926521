syscall

The issue revolves around QEMU's handling (or lack thereof) of the `MADV_DONTNEED` advice in a system call (`madvise`). The behavior described suggests that QEMU does not implement this specific functionality correctly, leading to different behavior than expected on native Linux. Thus, it falls under the category of an error with a syscall.
