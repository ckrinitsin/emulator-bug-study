runtime

The issue arises due to a code path that should not be reached during execution, leading to QEMU crashing. This is characteristic of a runtime error where unexpected conditions or logic lead to failure after program start. The presence of specific commit changes also points towards modifications affecting how instructions are handled at runtime.
