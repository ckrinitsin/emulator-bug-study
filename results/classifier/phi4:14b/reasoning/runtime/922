runtime

The issue described involves random segmentation faults occurring during the execution of a program using QEMU to emulate ARM binaries on an x86_64 host. This behavior is consistent with runtime errors, as it happens while the program is running and does not directly involve specific instructions or syscalls themselves being faulty. Instead, it suggests an instability in the execution environment that occurs unpredictably during runtime.
