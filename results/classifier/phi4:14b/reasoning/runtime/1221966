runtime

The issue described involves a segmentation fault occurring during execution, specifically related to buffer handling (`static_code_gen_buffer`). This indicates an error happening at runtime rather than being tied to any specific instruction or syscall directly mentioned in the report. Segmentation faults are typically associated with accessing memory incorrectly and usually occur during program execution (i.e., runtime).
