runtime

The issue described involves the Go runtime functions and garbage collector activities (`gcBgMarkWorker`, `gcBgMarkStartWorkers`), as well as system calls like `mmap`. This indicates that the problem lies within the runtime environment rather than a specific instruction or isolated syscall failure. The detailed mention of goroutines related to garbage collection further supports classifying this bug under "runtime".
