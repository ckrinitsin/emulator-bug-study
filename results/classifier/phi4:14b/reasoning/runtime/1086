runtime

The bug report describes issues that arise during the execution of test suites for numpy and scipy when running on QEMU for ppc64le architecture. The problems include array comparisons failing with unexpected results such as garbage values, permutations, or fundamental differences in output. These types of errors typically occur at runtime rather than being caused by a specific faulty instruction or syscall issue. Therefore, the most appropriate classification is "runtime."
