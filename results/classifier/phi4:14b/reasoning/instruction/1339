instruction

The bug report describes an issue with the execution of specific RISC-V instructions (`vsetvli` and `vfncvt.rtz.x.f.w`) within QEMU, leading to a segmentation fault caused by an assertion failure in the code handling these instructions. This fits the "instruction" category as it involves a faulty or problematic instruction.
