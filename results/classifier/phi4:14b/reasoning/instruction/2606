instruction

The primary issue described involves incorrect assembler syntax and ABI adjustments needed for compiling on Darwin PPC, indicating problems at the instruction level rather than system calls or runtime execution per se. The patch addresses these compilation issues directly related to code instructions. While there are mentions of runtime crashes, they stem from potential ABI compliance errors tied back to assembly-level corrections. Therefore, the classification is "instruction."
