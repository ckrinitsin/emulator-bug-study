Instruction

The issue described in the bug report pertains to incorrect behavior of specific instructions (SDOT and UDOT) within the context of ARM SVE on QEMU. The report specifically addresses how these instructions operate when used with certain vector lengths, which indicates an instruction-level fault rather than a syscall or runtime error.

The focus is on the assembly implementation (`sdot z0.d, z1.h, z2.h[0]`) and its alignment with expected intrinsic behaviors, highlighting it as a problem at the instruction execution level. Therefore, the most appropriate category for this bug report is "instruction."
