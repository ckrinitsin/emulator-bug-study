instruction

The bug report describes an issue related to how the `CVTSD2SS` instruction handles memory access across page boundaries, leading to crashes when emulated by QEMU. The problem is specifically associated with the behavior of this x86 floating-point conversion instruction rather than a syscall or general runtime error outside the context of executing this particular instruction.
