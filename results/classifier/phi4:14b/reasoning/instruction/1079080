instruction

The issue pertains specifically to the behavior of an ARM instruction ("srs") within QEMU's simulation environment, not to syscalls or general runtime issues. The bug report describes how this particular instruction does not perform as documented in the ARM Architecture Reference Manual by storing CPSR instead of SPSR. Therefore, it is categorized under "instruction."
