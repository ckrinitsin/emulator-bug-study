syscall

The issue described in the bug report involves an error occurring with the `setsockopt` function call using `SOL_IP` and `IP_OPTIONS`. This indicates a problem related to system calls, specifically within the QEMU implementation. The discrepancy between behavior on x64 Linux and RISC-V QEMU further points to this being a syscall-related issue, as it involves handling of options that are not implemented in the QEMU path for the given architecture.
