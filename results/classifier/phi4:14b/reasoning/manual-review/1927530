runtime

The issue involves HWAddressSanitizer (HWSan) detecting a segmentation fault rather than the expected tag mismatch while running a test case, indicating a problem occurring during execution related to memory tagging and access checking by HWSan. This falls under runtime errors as it concerns behavior observed while the program is executing with HWSan instrumentation, not due to specific instructions or syscalls themselves.
