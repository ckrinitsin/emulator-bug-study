instruction

The bug report describes an issue with the FMOPA/FMOPS instruction related to handling NaN values incorrectly due to improper usage of float_status pointers in its implementation. This is clearly tied to a specific instruction's behavior and not a system call or runtime error unrelated to instructions. Therefore, it falls under the "instruction" category.
