runtime

The issue arises during the execution phase when QEMU is unable to find a suitable guest address mapping base for the binary being run on an ARM architecture host using a QEMU version 8.x or higher. This problem does not relate directly to specific instructions or syscalls but rather occurs due to changes in how address mappings are handled at runtime by newer versions of QEMU.
