instruction

The bug report describes an issue occurring when executing NEON code generated by QEMU user emulation (`qemu-user-static`), specifically during operations involving ARM SIMD instructions (NEON). The presence of assembly-level code and the context in which a segmentation fault occurs strongly indicate that the problem is related to instruction handling, particularly with respect to memory invalidation or address calculation. This categorization fits well under "instruction" since it involves issues arising from the execution of specific low-level machine operations rather than system calls or general runtime errors.
