runtime

The issue described pertains to how signals are handled at runtime during application-level emulation by QEMU, specifically regarding thread cancellation and signal handling conflicts between the emulated environment and the host system's implementation libraries. This affects the execution flow rather than being an error with a specific instruction or syscall directly.
