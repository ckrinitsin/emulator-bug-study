syscall

The issue involves incorrect handling of command-line arguments (`argc` and `argv`), which are typically passed via syscalls to the program when it starts. In this context, user-space semihosting in QEMU is emulating these system calls on an ARM environment, suggesting that the problem lies with how these syscalls are implemented or executed.
