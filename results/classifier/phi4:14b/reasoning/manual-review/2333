syscall

The issue involves a segmentation fault occurring when using `__clock_gettime64()`, which is related to a VDSO (Virtual Dynamically-linked Shared Object) implementation problem on big-endian architecture (`armeab`). The error disappears when disabling VDSO, indicating the bug is associated with syscall handling via VDSO.
