runtime

The issue described involves handling an interrupt during program execution using vm86(), which causes a segmentation fault due to a write attempt on a non-writable page when cs:ip and ss:sp are in the same memory page. This behavior occurs during runtime rather than being directly related to specific instructions or syscalls, thus classifying it as a "runtime" error.
