runtime

The issue involves segmentation faults occurring during specific operations (like `dh_fixperms` and `debootstrap --second-stage`) that are not directly related to faulty instructions or syscalls but occur at runtime due to conditions within the software's execution environment. The sigprocmask wrapper patches imply a runtime configuration issue.
