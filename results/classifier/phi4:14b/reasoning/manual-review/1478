runtime

The issue seems to occur during runtime due to general protection faults and segmentation faults involving the `init` process and system libraries like `libc.so.6`. This indicates a problem that arises when executing specific instructions or calls rather than a fault in any single instruction or syscall itself. The errors are happening during the execution of normal operations post-boot, leading to a kernel panic, which classifies this as a runtime error.
