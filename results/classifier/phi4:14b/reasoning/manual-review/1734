runtime

The issue described involves changes in behavior between versions of QEMU when using `mmap` to map files over 1GB into memory, suggesting it is an issue related to how the program runs rather than a specific instruction or syscall error. The problem appears to be influenced by where the original ELF binary is loaded, affecting runtime execution and memory mapping capabilities.
