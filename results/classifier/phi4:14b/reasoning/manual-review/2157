runtime

The issue arises from alignment requirements due to page size differences on the host system and is related to how QEMU handles loading and executing 32-bit binaries on architectures with larger page sizes than expected for x86 (e.g., ppc64, LoongArch, arm64). This falls under runtime behavior rather than a specific faulty instruction or syscall error.
