runtime

This issue pertains to debugging PIE binaries using QEMU and GDB, where there are difficulties related to memory access during breakpoint setting. The problem is not about specific instructions or system calls, but rather an issue that arises when running or debugging programs in a certain environment (using QEMU with the `-pie` flag), which is more aligned with runtime issues.
