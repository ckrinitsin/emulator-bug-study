runtime

The issue involves segmentation faults during execution of older programs under QEMU's ARM64 emulation, which suggests it is an error occurring at runtime rather than due to a specific instruction or syscall. The problem appears related to CPU features and compatibility with older userspace environments when running in QEMU.
