runtime

The issue seems related to runtime execution rather than a specific instruction or syscall fault, as indicated by the segmentation fault and high CPU usage when using "git clone -s" under qemu-arm-static. Segmentation faults are typically associated with issues occurring during program execution, such as accessing invalid memory addresses, which fall under runtime errors.
