syscall

The issue described involves a "Function not implemented" error when using specific system calls related to `libaio` through QEMU emulation, indicating that it falls under syscall-related problems. The problem arises because certain operations or functions are not supported or implemented in the emulated environment provided by QEMU for foreign architectures like `aarch64`.
