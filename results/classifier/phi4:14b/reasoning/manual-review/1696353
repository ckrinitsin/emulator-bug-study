runtime

The issue described involves the Go language runtime and its handling of system resources, specifically related to thread creation flags when running under `linux-user`. The error is not due to an individual instruction or a specific syscall failure, but rather how the Go runtime manages system-level operations within the context of QEMU's user-mode emulation.
