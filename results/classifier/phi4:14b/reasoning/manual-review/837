instruction

The issue pertains to how `icebp` (`int3` opcode) raises different signals on QEMU compared to bare-metal hardware due to differences in handling specific CPU instructions. This falls under the "instruction" category because it is related to the execution and interpretation of an assembly instruction by different environments.
