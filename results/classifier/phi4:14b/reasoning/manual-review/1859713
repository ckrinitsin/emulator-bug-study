Instruction

The bug report describes an issue specifically related to how the `pauth` instructions are being handled within QEMU's emulation of ARM v8.3a architecture. It focuses on a problem with the implementation and behavior of the `paciasp` and `autiasp` instructions, which is why it falls under the "instruction" category.
