instruction

The issue pertains to incorrect behavior associated with the `ldff1(b|h|w|d)` instruction when using first-faulting gather loads. The problem specifically revolves around how this instruction operates under certain conditions (`<Zt> == <Zm>`), rather than involving system calls or general runtime errors, making "instruction" the appropriate category.
