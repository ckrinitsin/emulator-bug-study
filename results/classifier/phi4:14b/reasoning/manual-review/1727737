instruction

The issue seems to be related to a specific instruction (`e08f4004 add r4, pc, r4`) where QEMU appears to stall, suggesting an issue with how that instruction is handled or emulated in newer versions of QEMU. This aligns with the "instruction" category, as it involves a problem with a particular machine code instruction execution under emulation.
