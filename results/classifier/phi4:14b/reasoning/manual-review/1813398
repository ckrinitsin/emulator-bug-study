runtime

The issue involves undefined behavior occurring due to improper use of `malloc` after `fork` in a multi-threaded environment on a musl-based system, specifically related to how QEMU manages threads and memory allocation in such scenarios. This falls under runtime errors because it manifests during the execution of the program rather than from a single instruction or syscall fault.
