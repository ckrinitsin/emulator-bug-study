instruction

The issue pertains to how the rounding mode (`rm`) is handled within the instruction logic when `rm` equals 7 and should dynamically reflect changes from the `frm` field, according to the RISC-V specification. The implementation does not update the rounding mode as expected for dynamic changes in this specific case.
