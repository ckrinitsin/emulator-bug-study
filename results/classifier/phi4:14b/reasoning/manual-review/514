instruction

The bug report describes an issue related to how an instruction involving the stack pointer (SP) is handled, specifically when using the Memory Tagging Extension (MTE). The problem is with generating exceptions during execution of certain instructions in QEMU due to misinterpretation of tagged access rules as per ARM specifications. This falls under the "instruction" category because it deals directly with how an instruction behaves and its interaction with MTE.
