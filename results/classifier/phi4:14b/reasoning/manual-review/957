runtime

The issue involves "futex" system calls failing during runtime, specifically returning an unexpected error code and resulting in crashes while rebuilding Python. This aligns with runtime-related errors rather than specific instructions or syscall issues alone. The mention of "futex facility returned an unexpected error code" highlights the runtime nature of the problem.
