instruction

The issue revolves around an unexpected change in behavior due to the execution of instructions (`movq` vs `movl`) that are not what was anticipated based on the code being executed, indicating a fault related to instruction handling. This is further evidenced by the incorrect code address and differing instruction length (`movq` is 64-bit while `movl` is 32-bit), causing a misalignment in the expected register values.
