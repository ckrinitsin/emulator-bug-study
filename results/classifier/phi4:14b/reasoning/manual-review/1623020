runtime

The issue described involves a Go runtime panic due to an incompatible architecture emulation environment rather than a specific faulty instruction or syscall within QEMU itself. The error messages like "panic before malloc heap initialized" indicate problems during the program's runtime execution when emulating an AMD64 binary on ARM7, which is typical of runtime issues.
