runtime

The issue arises during the execution of `dpkg-deb` in a chroot environment, which is more about the operation's context and execution rather than specific instructions or system calls. The crashes described are due to signals like "Aborted" and "Segmentation fault," indicative of runtime issues often related to memory access violations or similar errors that occur during program execution.
