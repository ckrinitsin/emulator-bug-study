syscall

The issue arises because the Chrome-based app uses `/proc/self/exe` to fork processes, and QEMU does not handle this symbolic link correctly when executing with specific options like `--type=renderer`. This is related to how the application interacts with system calls for process execution. The workaround involves altering how paths are resolved, which also pertains to syscall handling.
