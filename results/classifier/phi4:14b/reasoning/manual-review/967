runtime

The provided information includes memory mapping details and system environment specifics (such as qemu installation via apt and versions of g++, libc, etc.) but does not mention any faulty instruction or syscall error directly. The context suggests this is more about runtime behavior in the presence of these libraries and tools, particularly how they interact within a QEMU environment. Therefore, it falls under "runtime" issues.
