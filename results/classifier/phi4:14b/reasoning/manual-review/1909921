runtime

The error message indicates that `qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context` suggests an issue occurring during the execution phase (runtime) rather than involving a specific instruction or syscall fault. The nature of the problem relates to signal handling and CPU state management within the virtualization environment, which are runtime concerns.
