runtime

The segmentation fault during the execution of `debootstrap` indicates a runtime error rather than an issue with individual instructions or system calls specifically. The fault occurs when attempting to execute commands within a chroot environment, suggesting that there is a problem with the setup or configuration at runtime, such as missing files (`/usr/share/debootstrap/functions`) which leads to the segmentation fault during execution of `debootstrap --second-stage`.
