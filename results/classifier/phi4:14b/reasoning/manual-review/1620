Instruction

The issue revolves around the SME FMOPA outer product instruction giving incorrect results when using tile 1 (za1.s). The expected behavior of producing a matrix filled with 1.0 is not achieved, indicating a problem with how the instruction handles elements in that specific tile configuration.

This classification is based on the bug report's focus on a specific SIMD instruction (`fmopa`) and its interaction with SME tiles, rather than issues related to system calls or general runtime errors outside of this context.
