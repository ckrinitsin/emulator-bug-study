instruction

The issue involves an incorrect implementation of the VMOVDQU instruction for YMM registers within QEMU. The problem lies in how memory operations are handled for 32-byte (YMM) registers versus 16-byte (XMM) registers. This is directly related to the handling and functionality of a specific assembly instruction, fitting it into the "instruction" category.
