runtime

The bug report describes a segmentation fault occurring at runtime when executing `rjsupplicant` using QEMU on x86_64 architecture. This is indicative of a runtime error rather than an issue with specific instructions or syscalls. The core dump and stack trace suggest that the problem arises during the execution of code within the emulated environment, which is managed by QEMU's runtime processes.
