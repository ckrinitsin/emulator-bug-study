syscall

The issue involves `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`, which is related to system call behavior, particularly when run under QEMU. The problem arises because the `unshare` syscall might not be fully supported or behave differently in a virtualized environment provided by QEMU compared to running natively on the host OS. This falls under the "syscall" category as it directly involves the behavior of a system call (`unshare`) within a virtual machine context.
