runtime

The issue involves an assertion failure during execution, which falls under runtime errors. The problem occurs when running the cross-compiled application using QEMU on POWER9 hardware, indicating it is not related to faulty instructions or syscalls specifically but rather a runtime error within the QEMU environment.
