instruction

The bug report describes an issue related to the handling of the `vmv.v.x` instruction for RISC-V RVV on a 32-bit guest (RV32) when using e64 vectors and maximum vector length (`vl == vl_max`). The problem arises from the assertion failure within the implementation, specifically in how it handles copying data into vector registers. This makes it an issue with a specific instruction's behavior rather than a syscall or general runtime error.
