runtime

The issue described pertains to the support for `mttcg` (multi-threaded thread context generation) on different architectures within QEMU, specifically focusing on whether certain PowerPC architectures support it or not. This is an architectural/runtime configuration concern rather than a problem with specific instructions or syscalls.
