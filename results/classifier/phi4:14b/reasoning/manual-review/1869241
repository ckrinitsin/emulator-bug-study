runtime

This issue seems to be related to handling large data types within the emulation environment provided by `qemu-arm-static`, rather than being directly tied to an instruction or syscall error itself. The "Value too large for defined data type" message suggests a problem with how certain operations are handled under ARM architecture constraints in QEMU's runtime environment.
