runtime

The issue appears to be related to handling specific hardware or software features not implemented on the ARM architecture running under QEMU's x86_64 emulation layer. The error "setup_rt_frame: not implemented" suggests that some runtime functionality required by the binary is missing in this setup, leading to a segmentation fault. This falls under runtime issues rather than instruction-level errors or syscall problems.
