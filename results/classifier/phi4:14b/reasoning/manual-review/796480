runtime

This bug relates to how addresses and memory references are handled during execution under user mode emulation, specifically due to limitations in address translation on a 32-bit host running a 64-bit guest binary using QEMU. This is not an issue with a specific instruction or syscall but rather with the runtime behavior of the emulated environment.
