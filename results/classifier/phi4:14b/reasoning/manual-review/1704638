runtime

The issue involves QEMU hanging due to weak symbol access and locking mechanisms when executing code for MIPS architectures in user mode. This behavior is related to how the program operates at runtime rather than being tied to specific instructions or syscall errors. The bug report describes a situation that arises during execution, involving synchronization issues (mutex locks) within QEMU's translation functions, leading to a hang that requires an external kill command to resolve. These aspects are characteristic of a runtime error.
