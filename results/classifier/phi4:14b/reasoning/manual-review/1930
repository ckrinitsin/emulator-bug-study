runtime

The issue described relates to an error occurring during the execution (runtime) of the binary using QEMU on an architecture that is different from where it was compiled (QNX SDP for AArch64 running on x86_64). The segmentation fault suggests a problem encountered when the program tries to access memory, which happens at runtime rather than with specific instructions or syscalls directly described in the report.
