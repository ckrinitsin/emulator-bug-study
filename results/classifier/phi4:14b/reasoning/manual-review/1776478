runtime

The issue described involves an assertion failure and signal 6 (Aborted), typically related to runtime conditions rather than specific instructions or syscalls. The error occurs during cross-compilation using QEMU and is associated with pthread mutex operations in a concurrent execution context, which indicates a runtime environment-related problem.
