instruction

The issue revolves around an invalid assertion related to handling ARM instructions, specifically in thumb2 mode within QEMU's execution flow. The bug report describes a scenario where the assertion `info->endian == BFD_ENDIAN_LITTLE` fails because the code encounters a big-endian instruction (`INSN_ARM_BE32`) while processing Thumb-2 instructions, leading to an incorrect handling by `arm_read_memory_func`. This is directly related to how ARM instructions are interpreted and processed during runtime, hence it falls under the "instruction" category.
