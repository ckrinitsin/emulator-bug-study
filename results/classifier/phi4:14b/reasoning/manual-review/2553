syscall

The issue revolves around how the `setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP)` call fails due to incorrect marshalling of the `imr_ifindex` field when using QEMU user-mode emulation for 64-bit platforms. The problem is related to differences in data structure definitions between the emulator and actual Linux kernel, specifically affecting syscalls.
