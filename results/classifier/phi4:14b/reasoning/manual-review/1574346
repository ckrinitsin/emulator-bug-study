instruction

The issue involves how an instruction (specifically `mov` to a segment register) is emulated differently between Intel and AMD CPUs. The problem lies in how this particular instruction's behavior should be accurately simulated for AMD CPUs, pointing directly at the emulation of an assembly instruction rather than a syscall or runtime error.
