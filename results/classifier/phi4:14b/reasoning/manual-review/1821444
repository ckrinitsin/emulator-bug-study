instruction

This classification is based on the fact that the discrepancy occurs due to how floating-point arithmetic operations are handled by QEMU-PPC (the PowerPC emulator) compared to an actual PPC environment. The error appears when translating `uint32_t` to `float32`, indicating a potential issue in the emulation of FPU instructions rather than with a syscall or runtime behavior outside of instruction execution.
