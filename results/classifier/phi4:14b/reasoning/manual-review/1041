runtime

The issue revolves around an inconsistency in how QEMU reports the platform type via auxiliary vectors during execution, not due to any specific instruction or syscall fault. This categorizes it under "runtime" errors as it involves behavior observed when running a program with QEMU rather than issues occurring at compile time or directly within the source code's logic.
