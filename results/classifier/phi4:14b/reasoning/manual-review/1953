runtime

The segmentation fault occurs during runtime when compiling an Elixir app on QEMU's emulated AArch64 environment running on an x86_64 host. It is related to issues that might arise from JIT compilation or other runtime conditions rather than a specific instruction or syscall error, suggesting the category "runtime" as appropriate.
