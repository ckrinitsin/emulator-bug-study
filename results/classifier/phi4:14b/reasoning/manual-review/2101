runtime

The issue arises from running an x86_64 binary on an aarch64 platform using QEMU, which involves emulation of different architectures rather than any specific instruction or syscall error within the application's logic itself. This falls under runtime issues as it relates to the execution environment and cross-architecture compatibility.
