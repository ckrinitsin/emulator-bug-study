syscall

The issue appears related to an unexpected signal during a `Syscall6` call within QEMU's emulation environment when running multi-threaded Go code. This suggests it is more aligned with a syscall problem rather than a runtime or instruction fault directly within Go itself. The behavior is influenced by the emulation layer provided by QEMU, affecting how syscalls are handled across different architectures (ppc64le and arm64).
