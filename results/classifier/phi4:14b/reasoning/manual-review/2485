syscall

The issue described involves the `getifaddrs` function hanging when linked against musl libc on big-endian targets within QEMU, indicating an error related to system call handling. The behavior changes between running in QEMU and actual hardware, suggesting that the syscall interaction with the environment is problematic under these specific conditions.
