instruction

The issue arises from how QEMU handles a specific far call/jmp instruction (`call fword ptr[esp]`) that works differently across environments (real CPU, VMware, and QEMU), suggesting an incorrect implementation or handling of this instruction in QEMU. This falls under the category of a faulty instruction as described in the bug report.
