runtime

The issue involves a segmentation fault occurring during the execution of `ldconfig.real` when using `qemu-aarch64-static`, indicating an error happening at runtime rather than being related to a specific instruction or syscall error. The problem is further described as a known regression in QEMU, suggesting it's tied to how the software operates under certain conditions after a version update.
