instruction

The issue described involves an incorrect implementation of the ARM64 SME ST1Q instruction within QEMU, which results in faulty behavior during its execution. This clearly points to an error related to how a specific instruction is handled rather than issues with system calls or runtime environment errors not directly connected to instruction execution. Therefore, it falls under the "instruction" category.
