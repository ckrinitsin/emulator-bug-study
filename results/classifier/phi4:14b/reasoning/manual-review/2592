runtime

The issue arises when attempting to use specific Python functions related to time within an emulated environment (qemu-aarch64), resulting in an `OSError`. This suggests that it is a problem occurring during runtime, rather than with a faulty instruction or syscall error directly, as the code runs successfully on native hardware. The issue seems linked to how qemu handles certain system calls or interactions related to time functions within the Python environment.
