Instruction

This classification is based on the mention of a specific RISC-V instruction `vsra.vx` that caused a segmentation fault during simulation. The problem appears to be directly related to handling this particular instruction within QEMU's simulation environment. Hence, it falls under the "instruction" category, as it involves issues arising from simulating an instruction rather than runtime behavior or syscall errors.
