runtime

This issue involves GDB's interaction with shared libraries during runtime within a QEMU environment, rather than being specific to an instruction or system call. The problem described is about dynamically linked shared library symbols not being recognized by GDB while debugging in qemu-x86_64. This categorization fits under "runtime" as it pertains to the execution and debugging of programs at run time.
