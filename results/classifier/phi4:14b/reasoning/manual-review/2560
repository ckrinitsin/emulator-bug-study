runtime

The issue described involves the Go garbage collector crashing when using `qemu-x86_64` on an AARCH64 host system. The problem is associated with the handling of memory and stack operations within the runtime environment, specifically during garbage collection activities. This makes it a runtime error rather than one related to specific instructions or syscalls directly.
