runtime

The issue described involves memory leaks occurring during execution on QEMU PPC, not due to any specific instruction or system call but rather because of behavior observed at runtime when using threads. This fits into the "runtime" category as it concerns how the program behaves in a simulated environment and interacts with thread management under those conditions.
