runtime

The issue arises during runtime when attempting to execute `ldd` on an ARM64 binary using QEMU on an x86_64 host. The error code 139 typically indicates a segmentation fault or access violation occurring in the emulated environment, which aligns with runtime errors rather than specific faulty instructions or syscall issues.
