runtime

The issue described relates to the execution (or lack thereof) of a plugin's exit callback during QEMU runtime operations. This is not about an individual instruction or syscall error but rather how the callback mechanism behaves when the program ends normally. The fact that it works as expected with an abrupt termination (like using CTRL-C) further suggests this is related to runtime behavior and possibly resource management or cleanup processes in a graceful shutdown scenario.
