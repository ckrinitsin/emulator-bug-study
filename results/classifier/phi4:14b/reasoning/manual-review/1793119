instruction

The bug report describes an issue specifically related to how the floating-point division operation (`fdiv`) is emulated when the Floating-Point Control Register (FPCR) is set to zero on AArch64 in QEMU. This discrepancy between the emulation and real hardware behavior points to a problem with the instruction itself in the emulator, rather than a runtime error or syscall issue.
