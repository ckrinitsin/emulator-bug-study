runtime

This issue relates to how memory protection flags (like PROT_EXEC) are handled during execution, rather than an individual instruction or a system call error. It's about verifying access permissions at runtime and ensuring that executable pages are correctly validated beyond just readability. Therefore, it falls under the "runtime" category.
