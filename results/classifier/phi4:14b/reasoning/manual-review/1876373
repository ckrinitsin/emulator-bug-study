syscall

The issue revolves around the `mremap` system call causing a segmentation fault when executed under QEMU for certain architectures (i386 and ARM), while it works correctly on native x86_64 execution. The problem is specifically related to how the syscall behaves in the emulated environment, indicating that it falls under the category of a syscall-related issue.
