instruction

This classification is based on the fact that the issue revolves around the "mffsl" instruction and its emulation (or lack thereof) on POWER8 systems within QEMU, leading to SIGILL errors when executed in an emulated environment. The core problem described is related to how a specific instruction behaves or fails to behave as expected during execution.
