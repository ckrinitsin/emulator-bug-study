runtime

The issue arises during the execution of a program under QEMU user-mode emulation for 32-bit ARM architecture and involves mismatches between memory mappings expected by the guest process and those on the host system. This leads to an "Input/output error" when accessing `/proc/self/mem`. The problem is not with a specific instruction or syscall but rather occurs during runtime due to differences in how addresses are mapped, making it a runtime issue.
