syscall

The issue revolves around how `qemu8-user` handles the return value from the `brk(NULL)` system call on Linux, leading to a segmentation fault when attempting to access or modify non-existent pages in memory. This directly relates to an error with handling syscalls within the runtime environment of QEMU.
