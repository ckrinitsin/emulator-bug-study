runtime

The issue involves signal handling and thread synchronization during program termination, which are runtime concerns rather than specific instructions or syscalls. The bug affects how signals are routed and handled when using `qemu-arm-static`, impacting applications like Mono and Java in a chroot environment. This is a runtime behavior issue related to how qemu handles threading and signals under these conditions.
