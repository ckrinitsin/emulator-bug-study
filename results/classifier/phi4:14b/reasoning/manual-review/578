syscall

The issue described involves the `getdomainname()` function, which is related to system calls and how they are implemented or not implemented in QEMU user mode on Linux/sparc64 architecture. The error "Function not implemented" typically indicates that the underlying syscall required by `getdomainname()` is not supported in this environment.
