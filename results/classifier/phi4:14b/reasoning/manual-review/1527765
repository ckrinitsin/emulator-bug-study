runtime

The issue involves random segmentation faults during compilation with GHC on QEMU-sh4-static, indicating it's related to runtime behavior rather than specific instructions or syscalls. The problem arises from unpredictable crashes that can sometimes be bypassed by retrying, suggesting a runtime error within the execution environment.
