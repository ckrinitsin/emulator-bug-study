runtime

The issue involves misaligned stack alignment during signal handling in QEMU's x86_64 userspace environment, leading to incorrect behavior at runtime. The problem arises from how the stack is managed when control is transferred to the signal handler, rather than being directly related to an individual instruction or a syscall error.
