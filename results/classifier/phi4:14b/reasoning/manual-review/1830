runtime

This issue is related to the environment and behavior during execution, specifically involving QEMU's handling of architecture emulation, rather than an instruction or syscall error per se. The problem arises from running an ARM64 CentOS container on an AMD64 Ubuntu host using QEMU for emulation, which leads to resource consumption issues that don't occur in a native ARM64 environment or with different host configurations.
