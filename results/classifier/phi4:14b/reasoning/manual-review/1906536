instruction

The bug report describes an issue related to setting the SVE vector length using an instruction that affects how QEMU simulates this behavior. The problem arises from a change in handling the `sve-max-vq` option and its impact on testing software compiled with specific SVE vector lengths, which is more about instruction simulation rather than a runtime error or syscall issue.
