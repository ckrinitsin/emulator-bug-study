instruction

The bug report describes an issue related to the `tlbivax` instruction not functioning correctly for addresses above 4G due to a truncation problem within QEMU's implementation. The solution involves modifying how an address is handled in the code, which directly relates to the behavior of this specific instruction. Therefore, it falls under the "instruction" category.
