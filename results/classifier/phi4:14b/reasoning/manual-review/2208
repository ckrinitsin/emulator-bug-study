runtime

The issue involves the behavior of the QEMU plugin system at runtime, specifically how register values are updated and reported during execution. It does not describe an error directly related to a specific instruction or syscall but rather concerns the interaction between QEMU's dynamic translation capabilities and the plugin system's ability to track changes in the `pc` (program counter) register accurately under different execution modes (`-one-insn-per-tb` option). This falls under runtime behavior because it involves how the software executes code and handles plugins during its operation.
