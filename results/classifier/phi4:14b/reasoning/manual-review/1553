Instruction

This classification is based on the nature of the build error involving an implicit declaration and nested extern declaration of the function `qemu_close_to_socket`. These issues typically arise from missing or incorrect code definitions rather than runtime errors or syscall problems. The problem occurs during compilation, indicating it's related to how instructions (or function declarations) are handled in the source code.
