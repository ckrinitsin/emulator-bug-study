runtime

The issue appears to be related to an illegal instruction during the execution at runtime rather than a specific faulty instruction or syscall error described. The crash occurs when certain operations are performed (like running `ls` or entering an invalid command), suggesting it happens dynamically during the program's operation. Additionally, the presence of "Aborted" and "Illegal instruction" indicates that something unexpected is happening in the runtime environment managed by QEMU.
