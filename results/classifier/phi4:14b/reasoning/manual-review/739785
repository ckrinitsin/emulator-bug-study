syscall

The issue "bash: fork: Invalid argument" indicates that there's an error related to executing or handling system calls within QEMU's user-mode emulation environment on ARM architecture. Specifically, it points to a problem when trying to use the `fork` syscall in this context. The additional failure with `qemu-linux-user-test-0.3`, which mentions an assertion failure within the dynamic linker (`ld.so`), suggests problems interacting with system-level functionality that QEMU is emulating, further supporting the classification as related to syscalls.
