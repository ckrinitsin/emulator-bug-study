syscall

The issue pertains to the handling and translation of system call arguments or return values (specifically related to control messages like `IP_RECVERR` and `IPV6_RECVERR`). The problem is that error numbers (`errno`) are not being translated correctly between host and target environments, which falls under syscall behavior.
