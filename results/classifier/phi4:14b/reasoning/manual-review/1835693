runtime

The issue arises during the execution of the compiled binary under QEMU for the s390x architecture, indicating it's a runtime problem rather than an error related to instructions or syscalls specifically. The segmentation fault suggests that there might be issues with how the environment is set up (e.g., libraries, system emulation) when running on non-native hardware through QEMU, which falls under runtime errors.
