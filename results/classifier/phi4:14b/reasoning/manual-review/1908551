runtime

The issue described involves a discrepancy in behavior when using different configurations of QEMU to emulate AArch64 SVE, affecting the output of `strnlen` and `strrchr`. This falls under runtime errors as it pertains to how software behaves during execution rather than issues with specific instructions or system calls.
