instruction

The issue described pertains specifically to the incorrect behavior of the `SLL` instruction within the RISCV architecture when executed by QEMU. This aligns with the "instruction" category since it directly involves how an individual assembly instruction is interpreted or executed, rather than a syscall error or a runtime issue unrelated to specific instructions.
