instruction

The bug report describes an issue related to how certain instructions (IRET, LRET, and RET) handle non-canonical IP addresses, specifically within the context of QEMU emulation versus native CPU behavior. This fits the "instruction" category as it deals with how a specific instruction behaves under different conditions.
