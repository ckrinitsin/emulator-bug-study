instruction

The bug report involves handling an illegal instruction (`SIGILL`), as indicated by signals related to specific memory addresses where these instructions are executed. The core issue arises from how QEMU processes or emulates this particular binary's signal handling for `SIGILL`, leading to a crash when executing the illegal instruction at 0x10A68, unlike its behavior in an older version. This categorizes it under "instruction" since the problem is related to how a specific instruction (illegal) is managed by QEMU across different versions.
