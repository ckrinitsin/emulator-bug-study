syscall

The issue involves incorrect behavior related to memory mapping (`mmap`) when handling large files, which is a system call operation. The problem arises from how `qemu-user` handles offsets greater than 4 GiB for 32-bit executables on a 64-bit host, indicating an error with the syscall implementation in this context.
