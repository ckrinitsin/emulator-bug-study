syscall

The issue involves an unsupported system call (`sys_getrandom`) within QEMU's chroot environment for ARM architecture on an x86_64 host. The error messages indicate that this particular syscall is not implemented and suggests falling back to a different method, which aligns with the `syscall` category.
