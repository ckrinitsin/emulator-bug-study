syscall

The bug involves a crash related to `pthread_getattr_np()` leading to internal QEMU operations that attempt to handle system calls like accessing `/proc/self/maps`. The issue arises during the handling of these syscalls in user emulation, indicating a problem with syscall implementation rather than an instruction or other runtime error.
