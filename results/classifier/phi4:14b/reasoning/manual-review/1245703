`runtime`

The issue involves QEMU consuming excessive resources during its operation due to handling symbolic links in directories such as `proc`, leading to an endless loop. This type of behavior is categorized under runtime errors because it occurs when the program is running and not necessarily linked to a specific instruction or syscall error, although syscalls are involved in the tracing output.
