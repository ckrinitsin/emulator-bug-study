syscall

The issue described involves an unexpected return value from the `lseek()` system call when executed under QEMU's RISC-V 32-bit emulation environment. The error specifically pertains to how this syscall behaves and returns incorrect values, which is indicative of a problem with syscall handling rather than instruction-level execution or other runtime errors unrelated to syscalls.
