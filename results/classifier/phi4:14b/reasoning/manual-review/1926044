runtime

The issue involves how QEMU-user reports the hardware capabilities at runtime rather than being related to an instruction or system call failure directly. The discrepancy between expected and actual behavior when checking `HWCAP2_MTE` indicates it's a runtime error in how QEMU-user handles this specific feature for ARMv8 architectures with Memory Tagging Extension (MTE).
