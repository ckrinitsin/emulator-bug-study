configuration

The issue described involves incorrect setup and configuration related to toolchain paths and environment variables within a CI job, specifically affecting how the compiler is resolved and used during the build process for QEMU targeting Hexagon architecture. This does not pertain directly to instructions or syscalls but rather how runtime configurations are handled at build time.
