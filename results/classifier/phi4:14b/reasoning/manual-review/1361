runtime

The issue described involves an erroneous `SIGSEGV` occurring during execution, which suggests that it is related to runtime behavior rather than a specific instruction or syscall error. The report indicates a segmentation fault happening while running under emulation, pointing towards a runtime-related problem within the QEMU environment.
