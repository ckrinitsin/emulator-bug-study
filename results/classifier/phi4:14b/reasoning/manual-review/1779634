runtime

The issue described involves a "Synchronous External Abort" occurring during the execution of x86_64 utilities on an aarch64 platform using QEMU. This type of error is related to runtime behavior rather than specific instructions or syscalls. It indicates a problem that arises during the execution phase, likely due to emulation challenges between different architectures.
