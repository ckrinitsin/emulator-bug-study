syscall

The segmentation fault occurs when attempting to execute the `openat` system call (as seen in lines #4 and #5 in the GDB backtrace), indicating an error related to syscall handling within QEMU's environment. The issue is specifically tied to accessing `/proc/self/maps`, suggesting that it arises from the way syscalls are being processed or emulated for this particular case, rather than a faulty instruction or a runtime error unrelated to system calls.
