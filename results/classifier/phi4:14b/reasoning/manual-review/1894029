runtime

The issue described involves incorrect memory allocation behavior during program execution, rather than a specific faulty instruction or syscall error. It is related to how memory addresses are being calculated and returned during runtime, likely due to the environment in which `qemu-i386-static` runs on a 64-bit machine.
