runtime

The issue described involves running an x86_64 binary on a LoongArch machine using `chroot`, leading to errors when executing commands like `ls`. This indicates a runtime environment mismatch rather than a specific instruction or syscall error. The problem arises from trying to execute an architecture-specific binary in an incompatible runtime environment, which falls under "runtime" issues.
