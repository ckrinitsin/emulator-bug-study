runtime

The issue pertains to SSL connections being broken due to an unspecified change that affects how QEMU emulates x86_64 architecture when using curl over HTTPS. This type of problem is generally classified under "runtime" because it occurs during execution and involves interactions between QEMU's emulation layer, the system call interface, or network communication rather than a specific instruction or syscall issue directly.
