runtime

The issue arises from coroutine management during asynchronous I/O operations, specifically when `bdrv_co_io_em_complete` may be called before `qemu_coroutine_yield`, leading to recursive re-entry and failure. This is related to runtime execution rather than a specific faulty instruction or syscall error.
