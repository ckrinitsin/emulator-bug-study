instruction

This bug report describes an issue related to how specific PowerPC instructions (`sraw` and `sraw.`) are handled by QEMU, specifically regarding setting the `ca` and `ca32` flags as described in the PowerISA specification. This fits under the "instruction" category because it involves a discrepancy between expected instruction behavior (as per documentation) and actual implementation within the software.
