instruction

This classification is based on the fact that the issue arises specifically when emulating the `fmadds` instruction on PowerPC64LE architecture using QEMU, as indicated by the difference between results on real hardware and in emulation. The problem seems related to how this specific floating-point multiply-add operation is implemented or handled in the QEMU emulator rather than being about a system call or runtime error in general execution.

The fact that the issue does not occur on actual POWER8E hardware but appears during emulation suggests an instruction-level discrepancy in QEMU's handling of `fmadds`. Furthermore, since it specifically affects the result of this operation and not other parts of the program or broader aspects such as system calls, classifying it under "instruction" is appropriate.
