instruction

This classification is due to the problem involving how subnormal values are handled by the AltiVec vector instructions on PowerPC architecture, specifically related to the behavior described for source and result vectors being flushed to zero. The issue appears to be with how these operations are implemented or specified for this particular hardware feature rather than a syscall or runtime error in the broader sense.
