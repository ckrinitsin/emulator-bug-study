runtime

The issue appears to involve multiple threads experiencing failures during execution, including signals and potential race conditions or synchronization issues. There are references to GDB and core dumps indicating problems that occur at runtime rather than being tied directly to incorrect instructions or syscall errors. The context suggests a complex runtime interaction problem.
