instruction

The issue appears to be related to the behavior of specific instructions (`cmp`, `cset`, and others) as implemented by QEMU for the AArch64 architecture between versions 8.1.5 and 8.2.1. The discrepancy in execution results suggests a possible change or bug in how these instructions are emulated.
