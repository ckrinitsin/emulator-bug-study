Instruction

The issue pertains to the logic used for checking file paths (specifically path traversal checks) in the code, rather than an error during execution or misuse of system calls. The code does not properly account for backslashes as separators on Windows systems, leading to a potential security vulnerability. This makes it an issue with the instructions provided by the software implementation.
