runtime

The issue described involves a segmentation fault occurring due to qemu-user's handling of stack size limitations, rather than being caused by an individual instruction or system call error. This indicates it is related to runtime behavior, specifically how resource constraints (like RLIMIT_STACK) are handled in the emulation environment compared to real hardware.
