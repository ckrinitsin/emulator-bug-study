Runtime

The issue described involves signal handling and ABI incompatibility between the Linux Kernel and QEMU, affecting program execution at runtime. The core dump and segmentation fault occur due to discrepancies in structure sizes, which is related to how signals are handled during program execution, rather than a specific instruction or syscall error.
