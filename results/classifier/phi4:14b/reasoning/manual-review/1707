syscall

The issue involves `brk()` not functioning as expected within the QEMU environment when executing an x86_64 binary on non-x86 architectures like AArch64 or LoongArch. This indicates a problem related to system calls, specifically with memory management, rather than instruction-level faults or other runtime errors.
