syscall

The issue arises from how `recvmsg` interacts with memory when executed in QEMU-aarch64 user mode compared to native aarch64 hardware, suggesting it's related to the system call behavior in this environment. The discrepancy indicates that the problem is not with the instruction itself but with how the syscall is handled differently by QEMU, particularly regarding buffer boundaries and stack space allocation. Therefore, categorizing it under "syscall" reflects the root cause of the bug as described.
