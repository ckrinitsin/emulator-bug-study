runtime

The issue described involves performance degradation when running commands within a chroot environment using `qemu-user` and `proot`, which affects the execution time but not due to specific faulty instructions or syscall errors. The problem is more related to how these components interact at runtime on different versions of Ubuntu, leading to slower performance.
