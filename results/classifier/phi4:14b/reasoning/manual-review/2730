instruction

The issue arises from attempting to perform an illegal memory access due to using an immediate offset that results in accessing beyond the address space defined by the `lui` instruction's base value (`0x80000`). This is related to how the RISC-V architecture interprets addresses, especially when dealing with sign extension and effective addressing.
