instruction

The bug report describes an issue related to how a specific SSE comparison operation handles an oversized 8-bit immediate value, resulting in a "sigill" (illegal instruction signal). The problem lies in the instruction's handling within QEMU, not with a syscall or any other runtime behavior. Thus, it falls under the "instruction" category.
