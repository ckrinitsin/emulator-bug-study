runtime

The issue stems from QEMU's incorrect handling of floating-point conversion at runtime rather than being related to a specific instruction or system call. The behavior described involves how QEMU translates or emulates the floating-point operations in this specific architecture (PPC), resulting in unexpected values during execution, which is typical of a runtime error.
