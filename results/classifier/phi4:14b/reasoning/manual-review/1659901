runtime

The issue seems to be related to running Java within a chroot environment using qemu-user-static and experiencing a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), which is indicative of a runtime error rather than a specific faulty instruction or syscall error. The randomness of the crash location further suggests it is a runtime issue, potentially involving interactions between the Java runtime and the emulation layer provided by qemu.
