LD_PREFIX option reads directories recursively in an endless loop

If I run qemu user emulation with -L /path/to/my/sysroot/ in which also the proc and dev filesystem is mounted QEMU eats my memory until it gets killed by the kernel.

According to the strace output it follows the symbolic links in the proc filesystem running forever in a recursive loop.

The easiest solution would be to add in the function "add_dir_maybe" in the file util/path.c an additional check for symbolic links that it don't follow them. 

Also I don't really understand the need of doing this. A lot of ressources are wasted everytime QEMU-user is started just by having the directory structure in memory. In my case this are more than 20000 entries which QEMU is loading every time.
