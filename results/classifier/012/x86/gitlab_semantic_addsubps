x86 SSE/SSE2/SSE3 instruction semantic bugs with NaN

Description of problem
The result of SSE/SSE2/SSE3 instructions with NaN is different from the CPU. From Intel manual Volume 1 Appendix D.4.2.2, they defined the behavior of such instructions with NaN. But I think QEMU did not implement this semantic exactly because the byte result is different.

Steps to reproduce

Compile this code

void main() {
    asm("mov rax, 0x000000007fffffff; push rax; mov rax, 0x00000000ffffffff; push rax; movdqu XMM1, [rsp];");
    asm("mov rax, 0x2e711de7aa46af1a; push rax; mov rax, 0x7fffffff7fffffff; push rax; movdqu XMM2, [rsp];");
    asm("addsubps xmm1, xmm2");
}

Execute and compare the result with the CPU. This problem happens with other SSE/SSE2/SSE3 instructions specified in the manual, Volume 1 Appendix D.4.2.2.

CPU xmm1[3] = 0xffffffff

QEMU xmm1[3] = 0x7fffffff

Additional information
This bug is discovered by research conducted by KAIST SoftSec.
