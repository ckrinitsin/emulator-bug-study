[BUG FIX][PATCH v3 0/3] vhost-user-blk: fix bug on device disconnection during initialization

This is a series fixing a bug in
          host-user-blk.
Is there any chance for it to be considered for the next rc?
Thanks!

When the vhost-user-blk device lose the connection to the daemon during
the initialization phase it kills qemu because of the assert in the code.
The series fixes the bug.

0001 is preparation for the fix
0002 fixes the bug, patch description has the full motivation for the series
0003 (added in v3) fix bug on vm shutdown

  vhost-user-blk: use different event handlers on initialization
  vhost-user-blk: perform immediate cleanup if disconnect on
    initialization
  vhost-user-blk: add immediate cleanup on shutdown

More specifically, it's not just a bug but crasher.
