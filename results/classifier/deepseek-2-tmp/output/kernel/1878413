/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/ empty even though binfmt_misc is loaded

_apksigner_ uses binfmt to execute via _jarwrapper_, since it is a JAR.  We have a test suite that relies on _apksigner_ working.  It was running fine in Ubuntu/bionic.  Since it was pegged to LTS, it got upgraded to Ubuntu/focal and it stopped working.  This is likely because /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/ is totally empty.  The "binfmt_misc" kernel module shows as loaded:

$ grep binfmt /proc/modules
binfmt_misc 20480 1 - Live 0xffffffffc0452000

This relies on binfmt support in gitlab.com's CI runner setup, based on Docker.  binfmt works in containers there, for example on Ubuntu/bionic:

Something in Ubuntu/focal broke this when running focal in the container on the same Docker host runners:

Debian's ci.debian.net lxc runners also have a similar problem, it might be related:
