qemu-system-x86_64 behaving as 32 bits
Description of problem:
Qemu is throwing the error ```file '/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found.``` and going into rescue mode while booting my pendrive with a dual boot installation from scratch from [link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Multiboot_USB_drive).
The files like normal.mod aren't in the i386-pc folder because it's a x86 architecture install. The path it was supposed to see it is ```/grub/x86_64-efi/normal.mod```
