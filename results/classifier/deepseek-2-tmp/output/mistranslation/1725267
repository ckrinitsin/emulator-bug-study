armeb regression since qemu version 2.8

Hi,

I have noticed a regression when I upgraded from qemu-armeb 2.7 to 2.8, and the problem is still present with version 2.10.1.

I am using qemu for GCC validation, noticed problems with testcases involving atomics, I'm attaching here atomic-exchange-4.exe.

# with 2.7:
$ qemu-armeb -cpu any -R 0 -L $PWD -E LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib $PWD/atomic-exchange-4.exe
$ echo $?
0
# with 2.8, 2.10.1:
$ qemu-armeb -cpu any -R 0 -L $PWD -E LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib $PWD/atomic-exchange-4.exe
qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped
Aborted (core dumped)
$ echo $?
134

The source code is gcc/testsuite/gcc.dg/atomic-exchange-4.c

Running with -d in_asm shows a difference early in the startup code:
IN: _dl_sysdep_start
[...]
0x40a17790:  908ff103      addls	pc, pc, r3, lsl #2

and then the next address is not the same with qemu 2.7 and 2.10.1

I hope you have enough data/information to reproduce and confirm/fix the problem.

Thanks
