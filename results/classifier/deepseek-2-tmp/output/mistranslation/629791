sysret sets invalid ss

I'm developing an OS. I use only sysret to enter user space. When an interrupt occurred, it would GPF on iretq'ing from it. On investigating, the cs on the stack is 0x2b (valid and correct). The ss on the stack is 0x20, which has a rpl of 0 which is incorrect. iretq checks that and gpf's. Making the irq handler manually modify it to 0x23 fixes it locally.

This happens on the non-kvm'ed qemu. I haven't tried the kvm'ed one. Qemu version 0.12.5. I haven't tried with the current development version either.
