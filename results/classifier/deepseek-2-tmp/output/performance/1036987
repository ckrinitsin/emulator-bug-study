compilation error due to bug in savevm.c

Since 

302dfbeb21fc5154c24ca50d296e865a3778c7da

Add xbzrle_encode_buffer and xbzrle_decode_buffer functions
    
    For performance we are encoding long word at a time.
    For nzrun we use long-word-at-a-time NULL-detection tricks from strcmp():
    using ((lword - 0x0101010101010101) & (~lword) & 0x8080808080808080) test
    to find out if any byte in the long word is zero.
