fstrim not working with image mounted to path?


guest os: windows server standard 2016
qemu agent version 100.0.0

os supports trimming
path mounted image does not support trimming

C:\Users\Administrator>fsutil behavior query disabledeletenotify
NTFS DisableDeleteNotify = 0
ReFS DisableDeleteNotify = 1


[@ ~]# virsh qemu-agent-command vps-xxx '{"execute":"guest-fstrim"}'
{"return":{"paths":[{"path":"C:\\"},{"path":"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Mailbox\\xxxx\\","error":"The given volume path is invalid. (0x89000001)"}]}}


Looks like the fstrim does not like/check images mounted on a path? Nor detects if image trimming is supported. xxxx is a ReFS mounted image without trimming support. 

If I enable trimming on the ReFS image, and configure it win2016, the result is still the same.


C:\Users\Administrator>fsutil behavior query disabledeletenotify
NTFS DisableDeleteNotify = 0
ReFS DisableDeleteNotify = 0

[root@c03 ~]# virsh qemu-agent-command vps-xxx '{"execute":"guest-fstrim"}'
{"return":{"paths":[{"path":"C:\\"},{"path":"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Mailbox\\xxxx\\","error":"The given volume path is invalid. (0x89000001)"}]}}

PS. tried this on a win 2016 std server with just one fs, no problems then.
