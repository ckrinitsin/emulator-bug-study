[feature request] awareness of instructions that are well emulated

While qemu's scalar emulation tends to be excellent, qemu's SIMD emulation tends to be incorrect (except for arm64 from x86_64). Until these code paths are audited, which is probably a large job, it would be nice if qemu knew its emulation of this class of instructions was not very good, and thus it would give up on finding these instructions if a "careful" operation is passed.
