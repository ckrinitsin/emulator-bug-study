User-emu documentation mentions inexistent "runtime" downloads

The official documentation for the user-space emulator[1] contains many references to binary blobs no longer provided by  QEMU.org for download. The parts mentioning them should be rephrased to avoid confusion and instructions for building these components should be provided (maybe as a reference to the LFS book with some scripts). The specific parts are:

* qemu-XXX-i386-wine.tar.gz, a wine build under the prefix /wine.
* qemu-runtime-i386-XXX-.tar.gz, a glibc build.

In addition, the documentation contains many other instances of inexistent "tar.gz" files, such as in "Network emulation". Most of these are inherited from the days of texi documentation more than 10 years ago, and they are so old that GitHub's blame have become unreliable. Someone really should run `fgrep -r 'tar.gz' doc' on the QEMU source tree. 

The issue was previously reported as [2], but nobody bother enough to google the filename to find out where the confused user got the idea from.
