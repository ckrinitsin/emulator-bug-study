qemu 5.1.0: Add UNIX socket support for netdev socket

qemu has a way to connect instances using a socket:

-netdev socket,id=str[,fd=h][,listen=[host]:port][,connect=host:port]

This can also be used to connect a qemu instance to something else using a socket connection, however there is no authentication or security to the connection, so rather than using a port which can be accessed by any user on the machine, having the ability to use or connect to UNIX sockets would be helpful, and adding this option should be fairly trivial.

UNIX sockets can be found in various parts of qemu (monitor, etc) so I believe having this on network would make sense.
