QEMU aarch64 can't run Windows ARM64 iso's

Hi,
recently Windows ARM64 ISOs have been posted on the internet..
just checked with latest QEMU 2.10 release from 
https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/qemu-w64-setup-20170830.exe 
"h:\qemu\qemu-system-aarch64.exe" -boot d -cdrom h:\iso\16353.1000.170825-1423.RS_PRERELEASE_CLIENTPRO_OEMRET_ARM64FRE_ES-ES.ISO -m 2048 -cpu cortex-a57 -smp 1 -machine virt
seems no video output..
checked various machine options for example versatilepb (says guest has not initialized the guest)..

so don't know if it's a QEMU bug or lacking feature but can support running Windows ARM64 builds (would be nice if you can add a Snapdragon835 machine type which is which first machines will be running..)


note running a Windows x64 ISO with similar parameters works (removing -cpu and -machine as not needed)

thanks..
