jammy qemu x86 int3: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI 

jammy:linux-lowlatency-hwe-6.8 6.8.0-44.44.1~22.04.1 qemu-x86 QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)


Recently (2024.08.05), I have been seeing this issue with ADT:systemd:upstream-1/2 test in which kernel panics/prints a stack. I have seen this with jammy:linux-lowlatency-hwe-6.8 and jammy:linux-ibm-6.8. Stack trace is different everytime because kernel receives an interrupt, drop what it is doing, and crash when handling the interrupt.

I think this is an issue with qemu and not kernel. For jammy, we are using qemu 6.2 and there are some fixes related to x86 interrupt handling in 8.x (https://<email address hidden>/T/). I propose we create a launchpad bug and trace the issue. If I am correct, we shouldn't see this in noble. And we should occasionally see this in 5.15 jammy kernels (and more frequently with lowlantecy kernels).


Meanwhile see comments below for some stack traces;
