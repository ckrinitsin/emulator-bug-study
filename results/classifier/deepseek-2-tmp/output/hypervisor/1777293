[REQUEST] SHARING MEMORY WITH HOST

Instead of a preallocated memory heap I would like for QEMU to share memory using shm. 

Example: Instead of using 16gb out of 32gb of ram to run Windows 10, there would be no option to allocate it, but to share the hosts resources; ie giving the host full access to the entire ram stack


I'm not a great programmer but I'm pretty sure QEMU's team could find this useful
