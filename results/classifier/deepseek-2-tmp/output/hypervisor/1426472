Recent regression: segfault on startup with -snapshot

As of git revision 041ccc922ee474693a2869d4e3b59e920c739bc0, qemu segfaults on startup when I try to boot a hard disk image with the -snapshot option.

To reproduce:

  wget http://wiki.qemu.org/download/linux-0.2.img.bz2
  bunzip2 linux-0.2.img.bz2 
  qemu-system-i386 -hda linux-0.2.img -snapshot

When I run this, qemu-system-i386 crashes with a segmentation fault. This is on a Debian 7 amd64 host.

git bisect implicates the following commit:

    rcu: run RCU callbacks under the BQL

    This needs to go away sooner or later, but one complication is the
    complex VFIO data structures that are modified in instance_finalize.
    Take a shortcut for now.
