no sound in spice when VNC enabled

Running Fedora32 with virt-manager → libvirt → qemu  I noticed that I got no sound in my spice client. The VM is configured with a SPICE-server and a QXL display, and in addition a VNC display.

Apparently when I remove the VNC display, then the sound is routed just fine to the spice client: I can hear it, and `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all remote-viewer --spice-debug  spice://localhost:5900` mentions SpicePlaybackChannel and SpiceRecordChannel. With the VNC server configured, such messages are missing, and I cannot hear the sound (which is sent by the guest OS to the virtual hardware).
