Mouse way too fast when Qemu is on a Windows VM with a OS 9 Guest

On a server, I have a Windows 10 VM with Qemu 4.1.0 (latest) from https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/ installed.
There I have a Mac OS 9.2.2 machine.
Now if I connect to the Windows VM with VNC or RDP or even VMWare console, the Mouse in the Mac OS Guest inside Qemu is waaaay to fast. Even when lowering the mouse speed in the Mac OS mouse setting, one pixel in the Host (Windows 10 VM) still moves the mouse by 10 pixels inside the Qemu machine.
I tried different resolutions but that does not help.
Is there any way to fix this or any way how I can provide more information?
Thanks
