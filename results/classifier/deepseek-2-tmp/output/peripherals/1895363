borland IDEs double up cursor key presses (need timing on PS2 port input)

Most DOS-era IDEs from Borland (I have tried Borland C++ 2.0, Borland C++ 3.1 and Turbo Pascal 7.1) exhibit strange responses to the keyboard.  Cursor keys are registered twice, so each press of a cursor key causes the cursor to move twice. Also the other keys occasionally are missed or duplicated.

From an internet search, the problem appears to be this.  These programs read the PS2 input register multiple times per incoming byte, on the assumption that the byte will remain there for at least a few hundred microseconds, before the next byte (if any) appears there.  qemu treats a read of the register by the guest as an acknowledgement of the incoming byte and puts the next byte into the register immediately, thus breaking the programs that expect each successive byte to stay in place for a while.

The obvious solution is to use a timer to advance through the queued bytes.
