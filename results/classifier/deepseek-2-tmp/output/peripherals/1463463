    Xen: Use the ioreq-server API when available
...

Added calls to xen_map_pcidev()  when available.  However these call are only done at startup, not when the guest configures the PCI to PCI bridge.  So Xen 4.5.0 (which has these) using a QEMU 2.3.0 or later can no longer access PCI devices that are not on a root bridge.
