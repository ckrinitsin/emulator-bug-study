Mouse stops working when connected usb-storage-device

I'm running a guest that has Windows 8 Pro (x64) installed. Every time I pass through a usb storage device from the host to the guest, the mouse stops working in the vnc client. When I remove the usb-device the mouse works again.

The mouse only stops working when I pass through a usb storage device and then make the vlc viewer (client) inactief by clicking on another program on the local computer (where I'm running the vnc viewer (client)). As long as I keep the vnc viewer active, the mouse works without any problems. But as soon as I make the vnc viewer inactief and then active again, the mouse will no longer work. I have to reboot the guest or remove the usb storage device.

I can't find any related problems on the internet, so it may be just me?

I hope someone can help me with this.
