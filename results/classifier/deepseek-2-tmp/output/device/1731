i440fx ide cdrom pathological slow on early win10 install  screen
Description of problem:
if you choose i440fx virtual hardware (default in proxmox) for windows 10 instead of q35 , from power on to the windows boot logo is 10 times slower.  you need to wait more then 1m45s on my hardware until the blinking cursor in the upper left goes away and the blue windows bootlogo appears. that leads to false assumption, that your setup hangs. 

what's causing this slownewss?

is implementation really that bad?

i did compare read performance of ide, sata and scsi cdrom in linux vm and cannot observe such a big difference.
