qemu-img should be able to create scsi based vmdk images

qemu-img can create vmdk disk images. These are always created as "ide" disks; that is, the paramter ddb.adapterType is set to "ide" in the .vmdk file.

I needed to create a scsi style vmdk image, in which ddb.adapterType is set to "lsilogic".

The attached patch (against qemu-0.12.3) allows me to convert a raw image into a scsi vmdk image:

 qemu-img convert -O vmdk -o scsi rootfs.raw rootfs.vmdk

The "scsi" option works also for the "create" command.

I hope very much that this change can be rolled into qemu.

best,
