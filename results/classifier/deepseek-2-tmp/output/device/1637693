QEMU not able to create vm with pflash and UEFI bios

Running Fedora 24 with the virt-preview repo on QEMU Version 2.7.0 and libvirt version 2.2.0. Tried to install a windows 10 vm with the OVMF bios and this error happens every time, it didnt happen when using the stable version of qemu for fedora 24.

libvirtError: internal error: qemu unexpectedly closed the monitor: 2016-10-29T04:07:29.678518Z qemu-system-x86_64: -drive file=/usr/share/edk2/aarch64/QEMU_EFI-pflash.raw,if=pflash,format=raw,unit=0,readonly=on: oversized backing file, pflash segments cannot be mapped under 00000000ff800000

Any ideas?
