Integrator/CP regression after QOM'ification of integratorcp.c

The following command line no longer works (i.e. the guest does not boot) with QEMU 2.7.0:

    qemu-system-arm -M integratorcp -m 128M -kernel HelenOS-0.6.0-arm32-integratorcp.boot

The HelenOS image can be downloaded here:

I did git bisect and came to this revision:

a1f42e0c9abc1028a8bb8686dbb3749fcd2d18e8 is the first bad commit

    hw/arm: QOM'ify integratorcp.c
    
    * Drop the use of old SysBus init function and use instance_init
    * Remove the empty 'icp_pic_class_init' from Typeinfo

Upon closer inspection, I discovered that for some reason s->memsz in integratorcm_init() is zero. In the last good revision, this value was 128. As a temporary workaround, hardcoding it to this expected value fixes the problem.
