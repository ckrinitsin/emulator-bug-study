Zynq7000 UART clock reset initialization

Hello,

we have come across a strange behavior in the Zynq7000 model of Qemu that seems to have been  introduced between 5.0.0 and 5.1.0.


The reset values of the SLCR register, in particular those for UART_CLK_CTRL, are such that
the UARTs should find functional clocks. Up to 5.0.0 this was also the behavior that was
implemented in QEMU.

Starting in 5.1.0, we found that - despite correct reset values [1] - the UARTs are non-functional
upon reset. Some investigation revealed that the cause for that is that the corresponding
clocks are not properly initialized.

Between 5.0.0 and 5.1.0, there are three commits  that touch the Zynq UART clocks [2]. The last of them [3] triggers the faulty behavior.

Attached is a patch that applies 5.2.0-rc2 and yields a functional UART. We surmise that the
underlying device release issue runs much deeper, so it is only meant to identify the issue.
