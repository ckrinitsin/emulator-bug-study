Xen 4.4 with qemu 1.6.2 VGA passthru NVIDIA

Hi!

Please, give me an advice.

I try use VGA passthough NVidia k40 on SuperMicro Server, but server is having error.
My Xen is using qemu (a9e8aeb3755bccb7b51174adcf4a3fc427e0d147)2.0.0

My VirtualMachine is have config:
device_model_version = "qemu-xen"
device_model_override = "/opt/sources/qemu-a9e8aeb/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64"

When I start VM:
dmesg
[    0.906181] pci 0000:00:05.0: BAR 1: can't assign mem pref (size 0x100000000)
[    0.906187] pci 0000:00:05.0: BAR 1: trying firmware assignment [mem 0x100000000-0x1ffffffff 64bit pref]
[    0.906193] pci 0000:00:05.0: BAR 1: assigned [mem 0x100000000-0x1ffffffff 64bit pref]
and lspci -s 00:05.0 -vvv
        Region 0: Memory at 85000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]
        Region 1: Memory at 100000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=4G]
        Region 3: Memory at 82000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=32M]

Why?

This is message in DOM0:
lspci -s 03:00.0 -vvv
....
Region 0: Memory at de000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]

Region 3: Memory at 5c00000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=32M]


Why Qemu don`t mapping BAR1?
Thanks!
