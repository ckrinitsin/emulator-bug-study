I've had bunches of these errors on 9 different boots, between 2019-08-21 and now, with Arch host and guest, from linux 5.1.16 to 5.2.14 on host and guest, with QEMU 4.0.0 and 4.1.0.  spice 0.14.2, spice-gtk 0.37, spice-protocol 0.14.0, virt-viewer 8.0.

I've been fighting with some other issues related to a 5.2 btrfs regression, a QEMU qxl regression (see bug 1843151) which I ran into when trying to temporarily abandon virtio-vga, and I haven't paid enough attention to what impact it has on the system when these occur.  In journalctl, I can see I often rebooted minutes after they occurred, but sometimes much later.  That must mean whenever I saw it happen that I rebooted the VM, or potentially it impacted functionality of the system.

Please let me know if and how I can get more information for you if needed.

I've replicated this on both a system with integrated ASPEED video, and on an AMD Vega 64 running amdgpu.

As an example, I have one boot which reported at 122 seconds, 245, 368, 491, 614, 737, 860, 983, 1105, 1228, then I rebooted.

I have another that reported 122/245/368/491/614/737, went away for 10 minutes, then started reporting again 122/245/368/491, and went away.  Then, I rebooted about 20 hours later.

Host system has no graphical impact when this happens, and logs nothing in its journalctl.
