efifb on Linux guest fails to load when using VGA passthrough

The EFI framebuffer fails to load when booting a Gentoo guest using ovmf + vga_passthrough.  I retested using they system rescue CD and saw the same issue, but also noticed that when a second framebuffer loads, nouveaufb in my case, the terminal appears.  I have also verified that the Gentoo min CD is not hanging at boot as I can type 'poweroff' after waiting a few minutes and the system responds by powering off.  I am unable to reproduce with seabios as I have been unable to get vga passthrough to work with that BIOS.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Install qemu and ovmf
    2. Download systemrescuecd-x86-5.3.1.iso
    3. Run qemu using one of the configurations below
    4. Select first boot option in GRUB menu
    5. Wait 30 seconds
    6. Press enter # System rescue is prompting for the keymap between steps 5 and 6
    7. Wait 2 minutes
    8. Observe fb console
    9. Note lack of output until very late in boot process
   10. Check dmesg
   11. Note efifb failed to load (invalid address)
   12. Note nouveaufb started late in boot process 

Expected Results:
   The EFI FB to load and display output to monitor.  This is the behavior I see when booting the host system via UEFI.

Actual Results:
   The EFI FB fails to load and display output.  System fails to display any output until nouveaufb loads.  When booting using the Gentoo minCD, this makes the system largely unusable.

Additional information:

Tested using Gentoo's app-emulation/qemu-3.0.0 version.  Bug report: https://bugs.gentoo.org/669880

I also tested qemu at git commit 179f9ac887973c818b2578bd79fa3ed2522657d4.  Configuration log for the build will be attached.
