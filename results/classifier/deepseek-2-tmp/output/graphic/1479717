Auto resize VM doesn't work with windows 10 guest

I,m using a Ubuntu 15.04 host and a windows 10 guest (both 64 bit) on a intel i7 proc. My ubuntu system is up-to-date and I'm using QEMU emulator version 2.2.0. I use virt-manager 1.0.1 and SPICE guest tools 0.100 are installed on the guest. 

With the exactly same setup and a windows 7 guest I can set "Auto resize VM with window" and it perfectly works. After installing SPICE in windows 10 I can still select this box, but it doesn't work any longer.
