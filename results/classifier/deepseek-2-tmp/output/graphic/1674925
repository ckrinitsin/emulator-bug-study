Qemu PPC64 kvm no display if  --device virtio-gpu-pci is selected

Hi,
i did many tests on qemu 2.8 on my BE machines and i found an issue that i think was need to be reported

Test Machines BE 970MP 

if i setup qemu with

qemu-system-ppc64 -M 1024 --display sdl(or gtk),gl=on --device virtio-gpu-pci,virgl --enable-kvm and so and so

result is doubled window one is vga other is virtio-gpu-pci without any start of the VM . pratically i dont have any output of openbios and on the virtual serial output

the same issue i found is if i select:
qemu-system-ppc64 -M 1024 --display gtk(or sdl) --device virtio-gpu-pci --enable-kvm and so and so


i had been try to change all the -M types of all kind of pseries without any positive result.

Ciao 
Luigi
