monitor command mouse_button 1 moves mouse

via the qemu -monitor interface, it is possible to move and click the mouse using
mouse_move 20000 10000
mouse_button 1
but the mouse_button command always moves the mouse to (0,0) making it rather unusable to (auto-)trigger any widgets in the VM from the outside.

Would be nice to have this available for my qemu/kvm based os-autoinst testing framework.
