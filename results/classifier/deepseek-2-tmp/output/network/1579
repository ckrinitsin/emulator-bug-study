Cache vdpa initialization & startup slow ioctls
Additional information:
* vring groups are cached in this patch, still not upstream [this example patch](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2023-03/msg05961.html).
* hw/virtio/vhost-vdpa.c and net/vhost-vdpa.c are both files that worth exploring.
