About wireless network card bridging

As a rookie, I don’t know if I should ask this question here. If it’s not right, I hope people who see it can help submit it to the right place. Qemu-kvm can add wireless network card bridging, after all, now you see that vbox and vmware can directly choose wireless network card bridging, and even hyper-v can be easily set up, arp proxy is too difficult for us rookies . I hope that qemu or other links can add a function to bridge the wireless network card, which can be directly set in virt-manager (for so many years, it seems that I can only use bridge-utils to bridge the Ethernet)
