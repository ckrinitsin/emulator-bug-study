"segmentaion" error when DMAing

When working with QEMU's PCI network card E1000 emulator, I accidentally put virtual addresses into the memory mapped registers when I should have put physical addresses. Short story is, the address was too large for the physical address space so when the network card tried to DMA the location it tossed a "segmentaion" error out to the console. That's right--not a "segmentation" error, but a "segmentaion" error. I just thought I'd let ya'll know about that little typo. 

My "qemu -version" gives "QEMU emulator version 0.15.0, Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard" on linux version 2.6.32. I guess it might be an older version, dunno if the typo's still there.
