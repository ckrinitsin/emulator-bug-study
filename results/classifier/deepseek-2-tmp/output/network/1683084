DNS server not working in QEMU usermode networking

Nslookup is returning "unknown host".
I try to ping 10.0.2.3 and it fails. Pinging 10.0.2.2 and 10.0.2.15 works correctly.
Downloading files via wget using a static IP works well.

Results of qemu monitor command "info network" included as an attachment.
