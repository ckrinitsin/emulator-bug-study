9p virtfs device reports error when opening certain files

Reading certain files on a 9p mounted FS produces this error message:

qemu-system-x86_64: VirtFS reply type 117 needs 12 bytes, buffer has 12, less than minimum

After this error message is generated, further accesses to the 9p FS hangs whatever tries to access it. The Arch Linux guest system is otherwise usable. This happens with QEMU 5.0.0 and guest kernel version 5.6.11, hosted on an Arch Linux distro. I use the following command to launch QEMU:

exec qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -display gtk -vga virtio -cpu host -m 4G -netdev tap,ifname=vmtap0,id=vn0,script=no,downscript=no -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=vn0 -kernel kernel.img -drive file=file.img,format=raw,if=virtio -virtfs local,path=mnt,mount_tag=host0,security_model=passthrough,id=host0 -append "console=ttyS0 root=/dev/vda rw"

There's nothing relevant in the guest kernel logs as far as I'm aware of with loglevel set to 7.
