[Feature request] Oracle Solaris 11.4 VM image

We already have handy VMs to build QEMU within:

$ git grep -l basevm.BaseVM
tests/vm/centos
tests/vm/fedora
tests/vm/freebsd
tests/vm/netbsd
tests/vm/openbsd
tests/vm/ubuntu.i386

Some people have interest in building QEMU on Solaris:

To help them it would be useful to have a Solaris VM.
