Curses Keyboard Broken On OS X

Whenever I run ``qemu-system-i386 -curses ...'' (with or without a ``-k en-gb'') on OS X 10.9, the keyboard does not work properly. For example, when attempting to switch to the QEMU console with Alt+2, I get:

``Warning: no scancode found for keysym 226
Warning: no scancode found for keysym 130
Warning: no scancode found for keysym 172''

I have checked and these scancodes are not mentioned in ``share/qemu/keymaps/''.
