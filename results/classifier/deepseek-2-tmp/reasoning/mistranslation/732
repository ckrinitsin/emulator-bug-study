Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report: "Can not use --enable-fuzzing on Ubuntu 20.04 Aarch64". The user mentioned the possible categories like mistranslation, assembly, device, etc.

First, I need to understand what the issue is. "--enable-fuzzing" is a QEMU option that enables fuzzing support. So the problem here is that this option isn't working on Ubuntu 20.04 with Aarch64 architecture.

Looking at the possible categories, "mistranslation" refers to issues in mapping source to target architecture, often in user-mode. Since the issue is about a feature not working correctly on a specific OS and architecture, it might relate to how QEMU handles different environments or targets.

Other options like device, graphic, network, etc., don't seem directly related to enabling a feature that's supposed to work across architectures. "Kernel" could be relevant if it's an issue with the host OS integration, but I'm not sure yet.

I think the problem is more about QEMU's ability to correctly enable fuzzing support on Aarch64 when running on Ubuntu 20.04. Maybe there's a translation or handling issue in the code that prevents this option from working as expected. This sounds like it could fall under "mistranslation" because it involves how features are mapped across different architectures and environments.

The issue relates to enabling a feature (--enable-fuzzing) not working on a specific architecture (Aarch64). This is likely due to incorrect handling in the translation layer. 

**Answer: mistranslation**
