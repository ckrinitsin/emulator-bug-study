Alright, let's tackle this bug report classification. The user is encountering an issue with QEMU where there's an invalid assertion in `arm_read_memory_func`. Specifically, the line `assert(info->endian == BFD_ENDIAN_LITTLE)` is causing problems.

First, I need to understand the context. They're using QEMU in user mode for a target called `armebe-linux`, which suggests they're dealing with an ARM system that's big-endian. The flags involved are `INSN_ARM_BE32`, indicating 32-bit big-endian instructions. 

The bug occurs when `_dl_new_object` calls `strlen`, which is implemented in Thumb-2 mode (armv6t2). This leads to `print_insn_arm()` calling `arm_read_memory_func()` with a length of 2 and the flags set for big-endian. The assertion fails because it expects little-endian, but they're actually using big-endian.

The user suggests removing the assert to continue execution without issues, which makes sense if the code can handle both endians correctly. If the assert is indeed incorrect, removing it could fix the problem without causing other issues.

Looking at the possible categories: `mistranslation` relates to incorrect semantic mapping from source to target architecture. Since this involves an assertion about endianness during assembly lowering (which is part of translation), it fits under `mistranslation`. The bug isn't related to device, graphics, sockets, or network issues but rather a fundamental assumption about the data format.

Therefore, the category should be `mistranslation`.

The bug report involves an incorrect assertion about endianness in ARM code within QEMU's user mode. This relates to how instructions are translated from the source architecture to the target, specifically in assembly lowering. The issue is with assuming little-endian when big-endian is actually used.
