Alright, I need to classify this bug report. The user is experiencing a memory leak when running a C++ program with QEMU-PPC. They mentioned that the issue only occurs under QEMU and not on real PowerPC hardware or when compiling for Intel. 

The problem involves creating threads using std::thread in C++. When they run this program, the memory usage keeps increasing each time Fun100() is called, which creates 100 threads. They also provided that the compiler used is powerpc-linux-gnu-g++ from Debian.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is related to memory management when using threads under QEMU. Since it's a PPC translation issue and not an obvious system call or hardware interaction, I'm leaning towards 'mistranslation'. This would mean the C++ runtime or threading library isn't being handled correctly in the PowerPC translation by QEMU.

Alternatively, since it's about memory management specific to the translated environment, maybe it's a bug in how QEMU handles certain system calls or resources when emulating PPC. But among the given categories, 'mistranslation' seems closest as it relates to incorrect semantic mapping from source (PPC) to target (x86 perhaps), causing resource leaks.

The issue is related to memory management under QEMU-PPC when using C++ threads, pointing towards a problem in how the translation layer handles the threading model.
