Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user is encountering an issue where Go binaries panic with "mmap errno 9" when running under QEMU-user. They provided details about their test setup: using a hello.go file compiled with gccgo-7, and it works fine on real hardware but fails in QEMU.

First, I'll try to understand what the error means. mmap stands for memory-mapped files, which is a way of mapping a file into process memory. The error "errno 9" corresponds to ENOSYS, which typically indicates that the requested function isn't implemented by the OS. In this context, since it's running under QEMU-user, maybe some syscall isn't being handled correctly.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. Hmm, I'm trying to see which one fits best.

The problem seems related to how QEMU's user-mode emulation handles system calls, specifically mmap. Since it's a Go binary panicking with an mmap error, perhaps the issue lies in the translation of syscalls from the host architecture (x86_64, since they're running on Debian) to the target (armel). If QEMU isn't correctly translating the mmap syscall for armel in user-mode, it might result in this error.

So "mistranslation" refers to incorrect semantic mapping from source to IR/target. Since the Go binary is using a system call that's not being properly handled or translated by QEMU-user for the target architecture (armel), this seems like a mistranslation issue. The other categories don't fit as well because it's not about assembly lowering directly, nor is it related to device, graphic, network, etc., unless there's an underlying system call that's part of those, but the primary issue is the syscall handling.
