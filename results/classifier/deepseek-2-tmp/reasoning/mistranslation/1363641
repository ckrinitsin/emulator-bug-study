Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned that when building QEMU version v2.1.0 on an ARMv7L system, the build fails with several undeclared errors related to '__NR_select', '__NR_mmap', etc. These seem to be syscalls because they start with __NR_, which is common in kernel headers for syscall numbers.

Looking at the error messages, it's clear that these symbols aren't being declared anywhere in the code where they're used. This suggests a problem with how the build environment or configuration is handling system calls. The fact that this happens after cleaning and checking out v2.1.0 implies it's not just a local issue but something inherent to the version.

The user also mentioned that `configure` should not have succeeded if the build fails, so perhaps there's an issue with the configuration step not properly detecting or including necessary headers or definitions for these syscalls on ARMv7L systems.

Now, considering the possible categories: mistranslation relates to incorrect mapping from source to target architecture. Since this is about missing declarations during compilation, it might be a problem in how system calls are handled across architectures. Assembly lowering (assembly) could also be a factor if the code relies on specific assembly for syscalls, but the error seems more related to missing symbols rather than assembly issues.

Other categories like device, graphic, socket, network, etc., don't seem directly relevant here. The issue is occurring during compilation in the build process, so it's likely related to how QEMU handles system calls across different architectures, possibly a problem with the translation or inclusion of syscall numbers for ARMv7L.

So, I think this bug falls under 'mistranslation' because it's an issue with handling (or not handling) certain syscalls correctly when compiling for ARMv7L.

The error occurs due to missing declarations of system call numbers (__NR_select, __NR_mmap, etc.) during compilation on ARMv7L. This suggests that the build process is failing because these symbols are not being properly defined or included from the target architecture's headers. Since this relates to handling system calls correctly across architectures, it falls under 'mistranslation'.
