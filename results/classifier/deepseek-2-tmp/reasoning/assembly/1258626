Okay, I need to classify this bug report. The user is experiencing issues with the keyboard using QEMU's curses interface on OS X. They mention specific warnings about missing scancodes for certain keysym values when trying to switch consoles. Since it's related to how the keyboard input is handled in the QEMU environment, especially under the curses interface, it points to a problem in translating key presses into the correct scancodes. This seems like an issue with the assembly lowering or how the keyboard events are being processed, which falls under the 'assembly' category.

The bug report mentions issues with the keyboard not working properly when using QEMU's curses interface on OS X. Specifically, it refers to missing scancode mappings for certain keysym values. This indicates a problem in how the keyboard input is handled during the assembly lowering phase of the QEMU process.
