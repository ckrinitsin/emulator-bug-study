Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the predefined categories. Let's look through the details provided.

The user upgraded libvirt packages from 3.6 to 4.0 and noticed that virtio-balloon is broken during live migration. The logs show issues with loading the virtio-balloon device and an "Operation not permitted" error, which suggests a problem related to permissions or access rights.

Looking at the categories: 'permissions' seems relevant because the issue arises after an upgrade, possibly due to changes in how certain files are accessed or handled by QEMU. The error message also mentions "Operation not permitted," pointing towards a permission-related problem.

Other possible categories like 'device' could be considered since virtio-balloon is a device, but the specific error points more towards permissions rather than a general device issue.
