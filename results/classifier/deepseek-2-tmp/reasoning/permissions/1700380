Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned they're using QEMU version 2.9.0 and encountered a "Permission denied" error when trying to commit changes to the snapshot image. They used the -snapshot parameter, made some changes, and then tried to commit via telnet.

First, I know that in QEMU, snapshots are read-only by default for certain devices unless explicitly allowed. The 'commit' command is used to save changes made to a snapshot. If it's denied, it likely relates to permissions on the device or how the image is being handled.

Looking at the possible categories: "permissions" seems relevant here because the error message directly mentions "Permission denied." Other options like "device" or "graphic" don't fit as well. The user isn't having issues with assembly or performance, and it's not related to networking or VNC in this case.

So, the issue is about the permissions when committing changes, which falls under the "permissions" category.
