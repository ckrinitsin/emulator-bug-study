Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the provided categories. Let me read through the report carefully to understand what's being discussed.

The user mentions a "nested 9p filesystem" using "security_model=mapped-xattr". They're observing that extended attributes starting with "user.virtfs" from the guest are being ignored. They suggest an escaping mechanism, like mapping "user.virtfs.x" on the guest to "user.virtfs.virtfs.x" on the host.

So, this seems related to how file permissions and attributes are handled in QEMU's 9p filesystem when using nested virtual machines. The issue is about security model handling and attribute mapping, which affects how files are accessed and managed between the guest and host systems.

Looking at the categories: "permissions" relates to access rights and attribute handling, which fits here because the bug is about attributes not being correctly passed or mapped. Other relevant categories might be "file" or "security", but those aren't listed. Since permissions directly deal with attribute access and user rights, that's the best fit.
