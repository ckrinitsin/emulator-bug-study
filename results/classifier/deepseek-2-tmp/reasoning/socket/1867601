Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the provided categories. The bug is about a test named 'test-char' not being concurrent with Unix sockets, causing 'make check-unit' to fail when running multiple tests in parallel. It happened on OSX CI, and the issue seems to be that the same Unix path is used for the socket.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. The bug involves a Unix socket, which falls under the 'socket' category. So, I think the correct classification is 'socket'.

The bug report involves an issue with Unix sockets being used in concurrent tests, leading to failures when running multiple tests simultaneously. Since the problem relates directly to how Unix sockets are handled during testing, the appropriate category is **socket**.
