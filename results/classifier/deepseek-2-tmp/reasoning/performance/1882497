Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user mentions that they're cross-compiling QEMU for Windows using a minimal Fedora container. They noticed that their build was taking way too long—over an hour—and started timing out on CI. The issue seems to be related to the 'cmp' utility from diffutils being missing during the build process. Without it, configure or make runs many times more than necessary.

So, the problem is about a missing tool causing the build process to slow down significantly. The user suggests adding a warning or error if 'cmp' is missing. 

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Hmm, this doesn't seem to be related to translation issues or assembly lowering. It's more about build tools and process efficiency. The missing 'cmp' affects the build time, which is a performance issue. But does it fall under 'performance'? Or maybe 'files' since it's related to file comparison during compilation.

Wait, but 'cmp' is part of diffutils, used for comparing files. If it's missing, the build might be recompiling everything because it can't verify if certain steps are necessary. So the issue impacts the build process's performance by causing redundant runs. 

I think the most fitting category here would be 'performance' since it directly affects how long the build takes. Alternatively, maybe 'files', but I'm more inclined towards 'performance' as it's about the time taken during the build.
