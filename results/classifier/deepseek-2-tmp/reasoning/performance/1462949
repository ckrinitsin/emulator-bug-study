Alright, let's try to classify this bug report. The user is having issues with qemu-img consuming a lot of time and memory when processing vmdk files. They ran some commands and saw high CPU usage and large memory usage.

First, I look at the command they used: "qemu-img info". This is part of QEMU's image handling tools. The error messages mention "Can't get size of device 'image': File too large" and then later it successfully gets information about a vmdk file.

The problem seems to be related to how qemu processes these images, specifically vmdk files which are VMware's virtual disk format. Since the bug is causing high CPU and memory usage, I need to determine which category this falls under.

Looking at the possible categories: performance stands out because the issue is about excessive time and memory consumption, which directly affects performance. Other categories like 'network' or 'graphic' don't seem relevant here since it's a disk-related issue.

So, the bug report is related to the performance of qemu-img when handling vmdk files.
