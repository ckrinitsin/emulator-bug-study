Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user provided a list of possible categories, and I should choose only one word as the category name.

The bug is about performance degradation in QEMU after a specific commit. The user mentioned that booting Windows XP takes much longer (2 minutes) compared to version 4.2, which took around 25 seconds. They traced it back to commit b55f54bc and linked it to an older fixed bug related to performance issues during VM initialization.

Looking at the possible categories, I see options like 'performance', 'boot', and others. The issue is directly about boot time slowness, which falls under both 'performance' and 'boot'. However, since the primary symptom is the degradation in speed, 'performance' seems more fitting as it captures the essence of the problem.
