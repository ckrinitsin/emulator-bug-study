Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem again.

The user is experiencing high CPU usage on their host machine even when the guest (Windows XP) is idle. The command they're using shows that the host's CPU is pegged at around 100%, which shouldn't happen if the guest isn't doing much. They tried different configurations, including specific CPUs like Penryn and pentium2, but the issue persists.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. I need to figure out which one fits best.

High CPU usage usually points towards a performance issue. The problem is about resource utilization, specifically CPU, so "performance" seems like the right category. It's not related to translation issues or assembly lowering because it's more about how QEMU is managing resources rather than incorrect code generation. Other categories like network or device might be relevant if it was a specific component causing high usage, but since it's across different devices and CPU configurations, performance is broader.

I think the best fit here is "performance".
