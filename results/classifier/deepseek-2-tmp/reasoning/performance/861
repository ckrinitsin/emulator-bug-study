Alright, so I need to classify this bug report: "Using qemu+kvm is slower than using qemu in rv6(xv6 rust porting)". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and other. 

First, the user is comparing QEMU with KVM versus just QEMU. They mention that using KVM makes it slower in rv6, which is a Rust port of xv6. The key here is "slower," so I should think about what category relates to performance issues.

The categories related to performance are 'performance' itself and perhaps others indirectly, like 'kernel' or 'hypervisor'. But the main issue seems to be about speed, not about how virtualization works (which would be hypervisor) or kernel functions. 

KVM stands for Kernel-based Virtual Machine, which is a hypervisor that allows QEMU to run as a user-space application with better performance by offloading some tasks to the host's kernel. So if using KVM slows things down in this context, it's likely about how the hypervisor interacts or perhaps the setup causing overhead. But the primary concern is performance.

So, I think the category should be 'performance' because the bug report is specifically about the speed difference when using KVM with QEMU.

The bug report focuses on the performance issue of using QEMU+KVM being slower than just QEMU in rv6. The main concern is about speed, so the appropriate category is:

**performance**
