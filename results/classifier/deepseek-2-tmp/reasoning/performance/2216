Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report says "Increased artifacts generation speed with paralleled process" and mentions that `parallel-jobs` was referenced in `main`. 

First, the main point is about increasing the speed of artifact generation using parallel processes. Artifacts here likely refer to something generated within QEMU, possibly during emulation or compilation tasks.

Looking at the categories, performance seems relevant because it's about improving the speed of a process. Other options like network or socket don't seem related since the issue isn't about communication between nodes but rather processing efficiency.

Performance issues often relate to how resources are utilized, and parallel jobs would affect that. So this bug is likely categorized under performance.
