Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user's bug report is "Provide short option for UEFI firmware." So they're asking about a feature related to UEFI. UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is part of the firmware used during the boot process. In QEMU, this would typically be handled by the firmware-specific components or emulators.

Looking at the categories: 'boot' seems relevant because UEFI relates to the boot process. Other options like 'hypervisor' might not fit since UEFI is more about the firmware than the hypervisor layer. 'Kernel' isn't exactly right either, as this is pre-kernel during boot. So the best category here would be 'boot'.
