Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user is having trouble starting Windows 7 x86 on QEMU version 1.7.50 built from Git. They followed the installation steps correctly and everything seems set up properly.

They mention that when they start the VM, it hangs at "Starting windows" with 100% CPU load after rebooting to install. Other Windows versions like XP work fine, so the issue might be specific to Windows 7 x86. 

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and other.

The problem occurs after rebooting into installation mode, which is part of the boot process. The VM hangs during this phase. Since it's related to the boot process, I think the category should be "boot". Alternatively, it might relate to how QEMU handles KVM or hypervisor functions, but the main issue here seems to be with the boot process itself.

The bug report describes an issue where Windows 7 x86 hangs during the boot process after installation. Since the problem occurs specifically during the boot phase of the virtual machine, the appropriate category is:

**boot**
