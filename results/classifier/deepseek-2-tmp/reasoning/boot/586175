Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The user mentioned that Windows XP/2003 isn't booting with their QEMU setup. They tried using the install CD first, and it boots automatically after a countdown, which they find odd. 

They're using libvirt but also tested without it via the command line: qemu-kvm -drive ... etc., but still no luck. The system hangs at "Booting from Hard Disk...". Their setup includes SeaBIOS 0.5.1 on Gentoo with AMD64, and they mention VNC as the primary graphics output.

Looking at the categories provided: graphic is one of them. Since the issue is related to booting and display, and considering that the user mentioned using VNC but it's not working correctly, this might fall under the 'graphic' category. Alternatively, it could be a device or kernel issue, but since the primary problem seems to occur during the boot process with the graphics output, I think 'graphic' is the most fitting.
