Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user provided a hello.c program that they compiled for ARM using arm-linux-gnu-gcc. They tried linking without using the standard libraries and got a warning about not finding the entry symbol _start. When running under qemu-arm, it dumped a core due to an illegal instruction.

But when they included crt1.o, crti.o, and crtn.o in their linker command, QEMU ran successfully without issues. So the problem seems related to the presence or absence of these start files.

Looking at the categories given: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue here is about the entry symbol. The user didn't have _start in their linked binary when they first tried. The linker defaulted to 0x101fc, but QEMU threw an illegal instruction error. Adding the crt files fixed it because those files likely provide the proper startup code, including the _start symbol.

This seems related to how the binary is set up for execution on ARM. Since the user was using -nostdlib and didn't include the start files, the generated binary might not have the necessary entry point or setup functions that QEMU expects. The problem isn't with the translation of code from one architecture to another but rather with the presence of required runtime startup code.

Looking at the categories again, 'boot' seems appropriate because it's about how the program starts and initializes, especially in an environment like QEMU which emulates a target system. Without the proper entry point setup, the emulation can't proceed correctly.

The bug report is related to the lack of necessary startup code (crt files) leading to an illegal instruction error. This affects the program's ability to boot properly on the target system.
