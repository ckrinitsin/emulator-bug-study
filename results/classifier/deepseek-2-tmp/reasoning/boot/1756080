Okay, I need to classify this bug report regarding QEMU's missing ATAGS support on ARM targets for non-Linux kernels. 

First, the issue is about providing an ATAGS structure, which is used during the boot process. Since it's related to how the kernel starts and receives information, it falls under the boot category. The other categories like device or network don't fit here because it's specifically about boot parameters.

The bug report concerns the lack of ATAGS support during the boot process on ARM targets for non-Linux kernels in QEMU. This directly relates to how the kernel is booted and receives information, so the appropriate category is **boot**.

**Answer:** boot
