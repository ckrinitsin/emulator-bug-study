Okay, I need to classify this bug report about adding multiboot2 support in QEMU. Let me read the categories again: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user is asking for multiboot2 support to run OS using the '-kernel' option. Multiboot2 is a specification related to how the bootloader interacts with the kernel and QEMU as the hypervisor or emulator. Since this involves booting an operating system, it's probably under 'boot'. I don't think it's 'hypervisor' because that refers more to the management of virtual machines rather than boot processes. So the category is 'boot'.

The bug report discusses adding support for multiboot2, which is related to how QEMU handles kernel loading and booting operating systems. This falls under the 'boot' category.

**Answer:**
boot
