Alright, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user is having trouble booting a customized kernel when emulating Broadwell or Skylake CPUs in QEMU. They provided details about their hardware setup, including using an Intel Core i7-6500U (Skylake) processor and running QEMU version 2.5.0 on Linux Mint.

Looking at the reproduction steps, they tried two different CPU configurations: Broadwell and host (which is Skylake). Both resulted in a kernel panic or inability to log in. The workaround was using Haswell instead, which worked fine. So the issue seems specific to these CPU emulations.

The possible categories include 'boot', 'hypervisor', 'kernel', etc. Since the problem occurs during boot with a customized kernel and is tied to the CPU type being emulated, it likely relates to how QEMU handles the hardware emulation for those CPUs. This could be an issue in the hypervisor or perhaps the way the kernel interacts with the emulated hardware.

I'm leaning towards 'hypervisor' because the problem occurs when using KVM (since '-enable-kvm' is used) and the CPU type might not be properly handled, causing boot issues.
