Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "Not Installing Properly" in the context of QEMU. Let's see... The possible categories are things like mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Hmm, "Not Installing Properly" sounds like it might be related to installation issues. But wait, QEMU isn't an installer itself; it's a machine emulator and virtualizer. Maybe the bug is about how QEMU handles installation images or maybe something related to the target machine not booting correctly.

Looking at the categories: 'boot' seems relevant because if it's not installing properly, perhaps the issue occurs during the boot process of the virtual machine. Alternatively, 'files' could be a possibility if it's an issue with how files are being handled during installation.

Wait, but "Not Installing Properly" might refer to the way QEMU handles the installation media or the target system's setup. It could also relate to permissions if there's an issue with access rights when installing something within the VM.

But considering the most likely category, 'boot' seems more fitting because installation typically involves booting into a new OS. If QEMU isn't handling the boot process correctly for the installation media, that would fall under the 'boot' category.
