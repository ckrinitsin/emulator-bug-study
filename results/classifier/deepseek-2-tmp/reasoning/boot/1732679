Alright, let's figure out the category for this bug report. The user is encountering a crash during boot with Cisco NX-OSv 9k using QEMU 2.10.1 and OVMF. They mention that it worked fine with QEMU 2.8.x, so something changed between these versions.

Looking at the provided configuration, they're using `-nographic -enable-kvm -cpu host -machine q35 -smp cpus=2 -bios /usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd`. The OVMF file seems okay based on its checksum and permissions. 

They tried other Cisco images with QEMU 2.10.1, like IOSv and CSR, which worked fine. The issue is specific to NX-OSv 9k, so maybe it's related to how the BIOS interacts with that particular OS image.

The logs aren't provided here, but based on their description, they're getting a crash during boot when using OVMF with QEMU 2.10.1. Since they've confirmed that GNS3 isn't the issue and the problem arises with a newer QEMU version, it's likely a change in how QEMU handles certain parameters or BIOS settings.

The key point is the use of `-bios` parameter pointing to OVMF.fd. In older versions, this might have worked differently. Maybe there was a change in how QEMU 2.10.1 initializes or loads the BIOS compared to 2.8.x. Alternatively, perhaps the way certain machine types (like q35) interact with the BIOS has changed.

The user is pointing out that NX-OSv might be more sensitive to these changes than other Cisco images. So it's possible that there's an issue in how QEMU's newer version is handling the BIOS or the machine setup, leading to a crash during boot.

Given all this, the category should be 'boot' because the issue occurs during the boot process of the virtual machine.
