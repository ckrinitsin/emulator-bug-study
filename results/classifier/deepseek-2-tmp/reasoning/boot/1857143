Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user reported that VMs won't boot from external snapshots after upgrading to QEMU 4.2. They mentioned that downgrading back to 4.1 fixed the issue, so it's definitely a regression introduced in 4.2. The problem occurs when using an external snapshot as the disk for the VM.

Looking at the categories, I should focus on what aspect of QEMU is failing. Since the VM isn't booting correctly, that points to issues during the boot process. They tried different guest OS and settings, but it consistently fails with 4.2. The problem seems related to how the disk image is being handled, particularly external snapshots.

The categories relevant here could be 'boot' since the issue is about VMs failing to boot correctly. Alternatively, it might relate to disk handling or snapshots, which could fall under 'files' if it's a file-related issue or 'kernel' if it's a lower-level problem. But given that the primary symptom is the failure during the boot process, I think 'boot' is the most appropriate category.

I don't see any mention of translation issues (like 'mistranslation'), assembly problems ('assembly'), or graphical issues ('graphic'). It doesn't seem to be related to networking ('network') or KVM hypervisor directly. The issue is more about the boot process itself, so I'll classify it under 'boot'.

The bug report indicates an issue with VMs failing to boot from external snapshots after upgrading to QEMU 4.2. This points to a problem during the boot process, making 'boot' the appropriate category.
