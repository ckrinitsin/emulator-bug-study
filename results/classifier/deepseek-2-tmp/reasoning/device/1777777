Alright, let's try to classify this bug report. The user mentioned they're using the versatilepb board with QEMU 2.12 and encountered an issue with the SP804 timer. Specifically, the pending bit isn't being set when the timer decrements to zero. They tested it on version 2.5, which works fine.

Looking at the categories provided: device seems relevant because it's related to hardware peripherals like timers. The problem is about how QEMU handles the SP804 timer's interrupt and status registers, which are part of the device emulation.

The issue relates to the SP804 timer not setting the pending bit correctly in QEMU 2.12. Since this involves a hardware peripheral (the timer) not functioning as expected in the virtualized environment, it falls under the 'device' category.
