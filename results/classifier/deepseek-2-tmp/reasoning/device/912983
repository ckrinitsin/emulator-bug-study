Okay, let me try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user mentioned that they're having trouble installing OS/2 Warp v3 past disk 2 in QEMU. They noticed that this issue started after some changes in how removable media are handled, specifically around the migration before QEMU 0.9.0.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, and others like device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. The problem seems related to how disks or floppy drives are being handled during installation. Since it's about diskette handling and specifically removable media (floppies), this points towards issues with device emulation.

The user tried using different QEMU versions and found that older versions worked but newer ones didn't. They also had trouble saving VM snapshots in newer versions, which might be a separate issue, but the main problem is with installation diskettes not being recognized after certain updates.

So, considering that the bug is related to how removable media (like floppy drives) are handled during installation, it likely falls under the "device" category. The changes introduced affected device handling, leading to the failure in recognizing subsequent disks.

The issue relates to how removable media devices, specifically floppy drives, are handled during the OS/2 installation process in QEMU. This points to a problem with device emulation.
