Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the bug report about CMOS RTC alarms not waking the system from suspend in QEMU. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user mentioned that after upgrading to QEMU version 2.0.0 on Ubuntu 14.04, their test application no longer works as expected. The issue is specifically with CMOS RTC alarms not triggering a wake-up from suspend. Previously, this worked in version 1.5.

I know that the Real-Time Clock (RTC) in QEMU emulates hardware for the guest OS. When an RTC alarm is set, it should generate an interrupt to wake up the system from suspend. The fact that this isn't happening suggests a problem with how QEMU handles these alarms.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue seems related to hardware emulation, specifically the RTC and its interaction with system suspend/resume. Since the problem is about an external interrupt (RTC alarm) not being handled correctly during suspend, it falls under how QEMU emulates devices. The RTC is a hardware device, so this points towards 'device' as the category.

I don't see any issues related to graphics, networking, or other categories mentioned in the bug report. It's more about the behavior of a specific hardware component within the emulator.

The issue relates to the proper functioning of the Real-Time Clock (RTC) device and its ability to wake up the system from suspend, which is an emulation problem. Therefore, the category is:

device
