Alright, I'm trying to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user is experiencing IO delays during live migration when the destination uses an LVM thin pool. They mentioned that during migration, the disk is initialized, which fully allocates the thin volume before any data is copied. This causes high disk IO usage, affecting other VMs on the same host.

The key points here are about the behavior of QEMU during live migration, specifically how it handles storage allocation and initialization. The user refers to a Proxmox forum where they were told that this is QEMU's behavior when discard is enabled. They want to know if there's a way to limit or avoid this initialization step.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue seems related to how QEMU handles storage devices during migration. The problem is that QEMU is initializing the disk (pre-allocating space) which isn't necessary for LVM thin pools since they handle allocation dynamically. This pre-allocation causes high IO and impacts other VMs, so it's a performance issue but also specific to device handling.

"device" seems appropriate because it's about storage devices and how QEMU interacts with them during migration. While the symptoms involve performance (high IO leading to delays), the root cause is in how QEMU manages block devices or storage resources, which falls under "device".

So, I think the category should be "device".
