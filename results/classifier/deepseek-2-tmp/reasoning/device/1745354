Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem again.

The user is experiencing an issue with QEMU where their CDOS guest isn't responding after focusing in the viewer. They suspect it's related to PS/2 mouse emulation because when they add "-usb -device usb-mouse", the problem goes away, even though CDOS doesn't support USB. They also mention that older versions of QEMU (0.11) using Bochs BIOS don't have this issue.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals.

The problem seems to be with the PS/2 mouse, which is a type of hardware emulation. Since the issue arises when using the default PS/2 setup and goes away with USB, it's likely a device-related problem, specifically with the mouse as a peripheral. The fact that older versions work suggests a regression in how QEMU handles PS/2 devices now.

So, the category should be 'peripherals' because it's related to the emulation of hardware devices like the mouse.
