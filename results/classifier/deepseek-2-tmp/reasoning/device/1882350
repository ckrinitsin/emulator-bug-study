Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is having an issue where they configure IDE disks with 'hdx' names in their VM setup, but when the VM starts, the disks are named 'sdx' instead.

Looking at the provided XML configuration for the disks, both have target dev attributes set to 'hdc' and 'hdb'. However, when the VM runs, the devices appear as 'sda' and 'sdb'. The user also shared lines from the vm.log showing device configurations with ide-hd devices but ending up as sdX.

I remember that in QEMU/KVM, IDE disks are typically represented under /dev/sd (like sda, sdb) when using certain drivers or setups. However, sometimes there's a misconfiguration or a bug where the intended 'hdx' names aren't respected.

The possible categories include things like mistranslation, device issues, hypervisor problems, etc. Since the issue is about how devices are named and presented to the VM, it might be related to how QEMU translates the target dev names into actual device nodes.

Mistranslation could mean that the intended 'hdx' isn't being correctly mapped, leading to 'sdx' instead. Alternatively, it might fall under a device-related issue because it's about hardware devices in the VM.

Considering the categories, 'device' seems appropriate here because it's directly related to how storage devices are handled and named within the virtual machine.

The bug report involves incorrect device naming when configuring IDE disks with target names starting with 'hd', but they appear as 'sd' in the VM. This relates to the handling of hardware devices, specifically storage devices.
