Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about 'change' and 'eject' commands not working on an overlay in QEMU. The user provided details that when they try to eject the CD from the monitor, it says the device isn't found. They tried different names but faced the same problem. 

Looking at the categories, I think this has to do with how devices are handled. Since 'eject' and 'change' commands aren't working as expected for a specific device (the CD overlay), it's likely related to device management within QEMU.

So, the category should be 'device'.
