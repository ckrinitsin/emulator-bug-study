Alright, let's break down this bug report to classify it correctly. The user is experiencing issues with QEMU on a PPC64 machine when using either GTK or SDL with OpenGL enabled. Specifically, they're having problems with the pointer and keyboard not working at all. 

When GL isn't used in KVM mode, the input works initially but eventually stops due to a USB unplugged message. On Debian Jessie with KVM, there's no input at all. The machine is a G5 quad running Fedora 25 PPC64.

Looking at the possible categories: the main issue seems to be related to input devices not functioning correctly in QEMU. This points towards problems with how QEMU handles USB or other peripherals. Since the user mentioned KVM and the USB messages, it's likely tied to device emulation or handling under the hypervisor. 

The failure is in device-related functionality, so "device" seems like the appropriate category.
