Alright, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user reports that when they try to reboot a VM with NVIDIA GPU passthrough using QEMU on Arch Linux, the host hangs. They mention it happens with both Windows 7 and 10, so it's not OS-specific. The issue occurs during guest reboot via the guest interface or libvirt's tool. After stopping the VM forcefully, it boots fine, suggesting a clean shutdown but failed reboot.

Looking at the possible categories:

- **device**: This seems related to hardware devices, specifically GPU passthrough which is a device-related feature.
- **peripherals**: GPU is a peripheral device.
- **hypervisor**: QEMU itself acts as a hypervisor when using KVM. However, the issue is more about device (GPU) handling during reboot.

The problem occurs during VM shutdown and reboot, which might be related to how devices are handled in the hypervisor or during state management. Since it's specifically about GPU passthrough causing the hang, **device** seems appropriate as it directly relates to hardware device interaction.
