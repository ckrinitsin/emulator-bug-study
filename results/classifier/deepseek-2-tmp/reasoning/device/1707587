Okay, I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user reported that a USB key is recognized in the VM but fails to read the certificate. The app stalls until the USB key is detached. They mention that the USB key uses interrupt transfers and points out that functions like usbredir_stop_interrupt_receiving and usbredir_stop_ep are clearing buffered packets incorrectly, leaving some data behind.

Looking at the categories, "peripherals" seems appropriate because it's related to USB devices and their interaction within the VM. The issue is with how QEMU handles USB redirection, which falls under device drivers or peripheral management.
