Alright, let's tackle this bug report classification step by step. The user is reporting an issue with USB passthrough in QEMU not working for their new smartphone. They found that a SET CONFIGURATION request was NACKed by the device, possibly because another host had already sent it.

They mention they wrote a program to fake a successful libusb_set_configuration call and used LD_PRELOAD, which worked. So, the problem lies in how QEMU handles failed libusb_set_configuration calls.

Looking at the provided code in host-libusb.c, QEMU doesn't attempt to claim the interface if libusb_set_configuration fails. The user suggests that QEMU should try claiming the device even on failure.

The possible categories include 'device', which seems relevant here because it's about USB devices and their interaction with QEMU. Other options like 'network' or 'graphic' don't fit as this is specifically about USB functionality.

Therefore, the most appropriate category for this bug report is 'device'.
