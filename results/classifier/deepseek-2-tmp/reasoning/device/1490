Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The issue is about F13-F24 keystrokes not being forwarded by an evdev input device in QEMU.

Looking at the steps provided, the user is using QEMU with KVM acceleration and has configured some input devices. Specifically, they're using 'input-linux' objects for a mouse and keyboard. The problem occurs when pressing F13 to F24 keys aren't forwarded to the guest VM.

The possible categories include things like mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, etc. Since this is related to input handling (keyboards), it's likely under 'device'. Alternatively, it could be a bug in how QEMU handles certain key codes or events, which might relate to 'input' but that's not one of the categories here.

The user provided detailed command lines showing they're using evdev input devices, so the problem is within QEMU's handling of these devices. Therefore, the category should be 'device'.

The issue pertains to key events (F13-F24) not being forwarded correctly through an evdev input device, which falls under input device handling.

**Answer:** device
