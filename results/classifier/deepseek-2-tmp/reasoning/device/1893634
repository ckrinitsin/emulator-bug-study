Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user provided a query where they want the category of the bug to be one word from a list.

Looking at the bug description: It mentions that blk_get_max_transfer() only works with the sg driver and returns MAX_INT when using the sd driver. This function is used in scsi-generic.c and scsi-disk.c, which are part of QEMU's SCSI handling code.

The possible categories include things like 'device', 'peripherals', etc. Since this issue pertains to SCSI devices and their transfer limits, it seems related to device-specific behavior or peripherals.

I think the most fitting category here is 'device' because it's dealing with how QEMU interacts with SCSI devices through different drivers (sg vs sd). It's not a translation error, performance issue, or something graphical; it's specifically about the SCSI device handling.
