Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report from QEMU. The user mentioned they're having trouble attaching an SD card to a specific SD-Bus on Sabrelite (ARM). They tried various command-line arguments but couldn't get the SD-card to appear on the fourth bus. They even had to patch QEMU to make it work, which implies that the current version doesn't support this functionality without modifications.

Looking at the possible categories: device seems relevant because they're dealing with hardware devices (specifically SD cards and buses). Other options like 'graphic' or 'network' don't fit here. The user is interacting with a specific bus in the QEMU machine, which relates to how devices are connected or configured.

The patch provided by the user modifies the sdhci.c file to allow specifying a particular bus for the SD card. This indicates an issue with device configuration, where QEMU doesn't currently support assigning devices to specific buses without changes. So, the problem is about how devices (like the SD-card) are being handled or connected in the system.

Therefore, the bug report falls under 'device' category because it's related to attaching a hardware device to a specific bus, which is a configuration issue with QEMU's handling of devices.
