Okay, I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user is experiencing VFIO_MAP_DMA errors when assigning an NVMe disk to a domain. They provided the command line and the error messages.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. The issue seems hardware-related because it's about mapping DMA for the NVMe device using VFIO. VFIO is part of KVM for managing devices directly. Since the problem occurs when using virtio-blk-pci with an NVMe disk and not when using vfio-pci traditionally, it's likely a device assignment issue.

The errors are about invalid arguments, memory allocation, and no space left on deviceâ€”all related to how the host handles DMA mappings for the virtual device. This falls under device management in QEMU, specifically dealing with hardware devices and their interaction with the hypervisor (KVM). So, categorizing it as 'device' makes sense.

The issue is related to device assignment and handling of DMA mappings using VFIO within QEMU, which falls under the 'device' category.

**Answer:** device
