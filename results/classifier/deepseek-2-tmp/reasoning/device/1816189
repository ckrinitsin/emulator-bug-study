Alright, let me try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is having trouble with snapshots in QEMU after an update to version 3.1.x. They can't revert snapshots using virt-manager or virsh, and the issue only happens with new machines created after the update.

Looking at the error message, it says that the device 'drive-virtio-disk0' doesn't have the requested snapshot 'FreshInstall'. This suggests something is wrong when trying to access or manage the disk snapshots. 

I know that QEMU uses a lot of different components, including storage devices and hypervisor interactions. The error mentions a virtio-disk, which relates to how virtual disks are handled in the VM. Since the problem occurs during snapshot operations, it's likely related to how QEMU manages these snapshots.

The possible categories include 'device', 'graphic', 'socket', 'network', 'KVM', etc. Given that this is about disk snapshots and device handling, 'device' seems like a fitting category. Alternatively, since KVM is involved in virtualization, but the error message points more towards the storage device.

So, considering all this, I think the bug is related to the 'device' category because it's about how the virtual devices (specifically the disk) are being handled during snapshot operations.

The bug report describes an issue where snapshots cannot be created or reverted after updating QEMU. The error message indicates that the device 'drive-virtio-disk0' does not have the requested snapshot, which points to a problem with how virtual devices (specifically the disk) are being handled during snapshot operations.
