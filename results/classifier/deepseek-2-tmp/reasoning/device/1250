Okay, so I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. The possible categories are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report is titled "[RFE] on windows, attach any storport disk directly, not just physicaldrives". RFE usually stands for "Request For Enhancement", so it's more about a feature request than a bug per se. The user wants to be able to attach any StorPort disk directly in QEMU on Windows, not limited to physical drives.

Looking at the categories, I need to see which one fits best. Mistranslation is about incorrect mapping from source architecture to target, which doesn't seem relevant here. Assembly lowering is about converting code to assembly, also not applicable. Other is a catch-all, but maybe too broad.

Device seems more specific. Since this is about attaching disks (storage devices) in QEMU, and the user wants support for any StorPort disk, it's related to device handling. So I think 'device' would be the appropriate category here.
