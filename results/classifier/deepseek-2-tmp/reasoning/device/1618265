Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report about QEMU. The user mentioned that currently, virtio-input devices can't be used before the kernel loads, and they're asking if it's possible to load the drivers earlier for preboot menus like GRUB.

First, I need to understand what the issue is. Virtio-input devices are part of the VirtIO family, which provides a virtualized hardware environment. These devices allow guest operating systems to access host peripherals, like keyboards and mice, in a way that's efficient and compatible with paravirtualization.

The user is pointing out that right now, these drivers aren't available before the kernel boots. That means during the preboot phase, such as when using GRUB or other boot menus, you can't interact with the keyboard or mouse because the drivers haven't been loaded yet.

Looking at the possible categories: there's 'device', which seems relevant since it's about device drivers. Other options like 'network' or 'graphic' don't fit here; this is specifically about input devices.

I should also consider if any other category might be more precise, but 'device' seems to cover the issue of driver availability and hardware interaction. It's not a performance issue, nor does it relate directly to the hypervisor or kernel in terms of their core functions, but rather the timing of when device drivers are loaded.

So, putting it together, the bug is about the ability to use virtio-input devices before the kernel loads, which ties into device driver functionality. Therefore, the category should be 'device'.
