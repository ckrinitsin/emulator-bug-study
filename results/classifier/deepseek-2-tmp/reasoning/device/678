Alright, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user is having trouble with the 'eject' command in QEMU's monitor not working for their CD-ROM device. They've tried different commands like eject cdrom1, cdrom1-format, and cdrom1-storage, but each time they get an error that the device isn't found.

Looking at the steps to reproduce, when using the blockdev option, the eject command fails. However, when they switch to using -drive instead of -blockdev, it works fine. This suggests there might be a difference in how QEMU handles devices configured with these options, leading to the eject issue.

The user also mentioned a similar bug on Launchpad (bug #1799766), which probably points to a known issue related to block device handling or configuration differences between -blockdev and -drive. 

Now, considering the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem revolves around a monitor command not functioning correctly when using blockdev. This seems to be an issue with how QEMU handles the device configuration or the way commands are interpreted for such devices. It doesn't fall under user-mode translation issues (mistranslation) since it's about the monitor's functionality. It's also not directly related to assembly lowering (assembly). 

The most fitting category here is 'device' because the issue pertains to a specific device command failing, likely due to how QEMU manages block devices or interprets the eject command under certain configurations.
