Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report from QEMU. Let's see what the problem is.

The user reports that using "-set device" with a device specified in JSON doesn't work. The error message says there's no such device "ua-igd". But when they use the legacy format, it works fine. So the issue arises specifically when using JSON device specifications.

Looking at the categories provided: assembly, device, graphic, network, etc. I'm thinking about which category fits best.

The problem is related to how devices are specified and managed in QEMU, especially when using JSON versus legacy formats. The "-set" command isn't working as expected with JSON. So it's likely a device-related issue because the problem occurs when setting device options via JSON.

Other categories like 'assembly' or 'network' don't seem relevant here. It's specifically about device management and how commands are interpreted, so 'device' is probably the right category.
