Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user provided some details about their problem with ivshmem and MSI-X interrupts not working on an Arm64 guest.

First, let me break down what's happening here. They're using QEMU-KVM on an NVIDIA Xavier board, which is Arm64-based. They've set up ivshmem-server and ivshmem-client on the host, and their guests can see the PCIe device. The driver they wrote initializes correctly, and when they manually trigger the interrupt using devmem, it works. However, when using the ivshmem-client's "int" command to ring the guest, nothing happens.

The user suspects that the issue lies within QEMU's ivshmem-doorbell mechanism not properly notifying the MSI-X interrupts on the Arm64 guest. They've tested their driver successfully on X86, which works, so it's more likely an issue with how QEMU handles this on Arm64.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. The problem is related to PCIe devices and interrupt handling within QEMU for KVM guests on Arm64.

The ivshmem-doorbell is part of the I/O device setup in QEMU. Since it's about a device (PCIe) not functioning correctly regarding interrupts, the category should be 'device'.
