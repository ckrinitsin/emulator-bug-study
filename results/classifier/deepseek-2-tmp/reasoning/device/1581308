Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. The issue is about the OHCI not checking the 'num-ports' property leading to an out-of-bounds write and crashing QEMU.

Looking at the possible categories: assembly, device, graphic, etc. Since it's related to USB ports in OHCI, which is a type of hardware device emulation, the category should be 'device'.

I don't see anything about translation or assembly lowering here; it's more about handling device properties incorrectly.

The bug relates to the OHCI device not properly validating the 'num-ports' property. Since this is an issue with device-specific behavior and configuration, the appropriate category is:

**device**
