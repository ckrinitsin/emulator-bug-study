Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user mentioned two main issues related to the `usb-host` device.

First, when they use `hostaddr=010`, QEMU parses it as an octal number (which is 8 in decimal), but they expected it to be treated as a hexadecimal address. This seems like a parsing issue where the code incorrectly interprets the number's base.

Second, adding a non-existent USB device with a bogus `hostaddr` doesn't report an error correctly. Instead of failing properly, it creates a generic host device. The problem lies in how QEMU handles errors during device initializationâ€”specifically, `usb_claim_port` is called but if there's no valid device, it doesn't handle the error as expected.

Looking at the possible categories: device makes sense here because the issue revolves around USB devices and their configuration within QEMU.

The bug report discusses issues with USB host devices in QEMU. The first issue is about incorrect parsing of `hostaddr` values, where an octal number was treated differently than intended (likely as hexadecimal). The second issue relates to error handling when a non-existent USB device is added, leading to improper creation of a generic device without proper error reporting.

These issues are related to how QEMU handles USB devices and their configuration. Therefore, the appropriate category for this bug report is **device**.
