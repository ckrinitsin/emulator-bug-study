Okay, so I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The issue is about a tablet-like mouse behavior in an Arch Linux guest even when no usb-tablet device is specified. Let me go through the details step by step.

First, the user describes that their Arch Linux guest has absolute mouse tracking without any -device usb-tablet being added. They also mention using `-nodefaults`, which should disable default devices, so I'm thinking that maybe QEMU is automatically adding some device or there's a configuration issue.

The expected behavior is to have a separate mouse pointer, similar to Windows guests, where the mouse isn't captured immediately. Instead, it behaves more like a standard input device, requiring a click or key press to take over, which is typical for relative pointing devices.

Looking at the steps to reproduce: they installed Arch Linux, gnome metapackage with GDM, rebooted, and upon login, the mouse tracking was absolute without needing to click on the window. So this seems related to how QEMU handles input devices, particularly mice.

The possible categories given include 'input' which I don't see in the list but wait, let me check again: the options are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals. Hmm, so no direct 'input' category. Wait, perhaps it's related to a device being added automatically, which falls under 'device'.

Alternatively, since the mouse behavior is about how QEMU handles input devices, maybe it's more of an input issue, but since that's not listed, I have to choose from the given options.

The bug report doesn't mention issues with VNC or KVM hypervisor directly. It's about the mouse device being treated as a tablet when it shouldn't be. So perhaps QEMU is incorrectly assigning thetablet type without explicit configuration. This could be related to how devices are added, so 'device' might be the category.

Another angle: absolute mouse tracking often relates to how the guest OS interprets the input events. But since the issue is present even with -nodefaults, it suggests that QEMU might still be adding some default device or not properly respecting the configuration. So again, pointing towards a 'device' issue.

I think 'device' is the most appropriate category here because it's about how QEMU handles mouse devices and whether it's correctly adhering to the specified configurations or defaults.

The bug report discusses an issue where a guest OS under QEMU exhibits absolute mouse tracking without the explicit addition of a usb-tablet device. The problem arises even when using `-nodefaults`, which should disable default devices, indicating that QEMU might be automatically enabling a tablet-like mouse behavior. This is unwanted as the expected behavior is a separate mouse pointer, similar to other guests like Windows.

The issue likely stems from how QEMU configures input devices, particularly mice. Since the problem occurs without an explicit device being added and despite using `-nodefaults`, it suggests that QEMU might be adding a default tablet device or mishandling the configuration of the mouse. This points towards a problem with how devices are handled in QEMU.
