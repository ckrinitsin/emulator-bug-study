Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned that when they hotplug several VirtIO SCSI disks consecutively, sometimes the guest OS doesn't see all of them. However, after rebooting, the missing disks appear again.

Looking at the details, the setup uses CentOS 7.3 as both host and guest with VirtIO-SCSI controllers configured using an IO thread. The issue seems to be related to how these controllers are set up with or without the IOthread. Without IOthread, all disks are visible, but with it, some disks go missing temporarily.

The user thinks that the difference is in how notifications are sent: with IOthread, virtio_notify_irqfd is used, while without, it's virtio_notify. They're wondering if there's a race condition causing interrupts to be lost when using the IRQFD method.

Now, looking at the possible categories: hypervisor, device, etc. The issue involves VirtIO SCSI controllers and disk hotplugging, which relates to hardware devices being managed by QEMU/KVM. Since it's about device configuration and notification mechanisms affecting device visibility in the guest, this falls under the 'device' category.

I don't see elements related to translation issues (mistranslation), assembly lowering (assembly), or performance/permissions/kernel directly. It's more about how devices are handled during hotplugging.
