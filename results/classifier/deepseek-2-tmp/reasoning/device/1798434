Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user submitted a feature request about automatic device configuration discovery for QEMU. They want a script that enumerates the host's device tree and generates corresponding QEMU commands.

First, looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The feature request is about creating a script to map host devices into an emulated environment. This seems related to how devices are handled in QEMU. Since it's about device configuration and emulation, the most fitting category would be 'device'. It doesn't fall under assembly or translation issues, nor does it relate directly to networking or graphics without more specifics.

So, I think the correct classification is 'device'.
