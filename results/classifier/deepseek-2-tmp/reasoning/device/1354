Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report: "-device usb-tablet not working on android guest." The user is asking me to respond with just one word from a given list of categories.

First, I'll break down the problem. The issue is that a USB tablet isn't functioning when used as a device in an Android guest operating system within QEMU. Since this involves a USB device and it's related to how devices are handled in the virtual machine setup, I should look for the most relevant category.

Looking at the possible categories: device seems like the obvious fit here because it directly relates to hardware devices not working as expected. The other options don't quite match; for example, 'graphic' would be more about display issues, and 'network' is unrelated to USB functionality.

I think "device" is the right category because it's specifically about a device (USB tablet) not functioning in the guest environment.
