Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user mentioned that their USB Digital Oscilloscope works fine on a physical Windows machine but doesn't work when running Windows in a virtualized environment using QEMU. They tried two different methods for passing the USB device through: using -usbdevice and specifying the vendor and product IDs, but neither worked.

The error message they received is "This device cannot start" with code 10 from Device Manager. That usually indicates that the driver couldn't start the device properly. The user suspects it's an issue with how QEMU handles non-standard USB devices.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Since the problem is about a USB device not being correctly passed through to the guest OS, this falls under how QEMU handles hardware devices. So the category would likely be related to device handling. The term "peripherals" seems appropriate here because it's about connecting external devices to the virtual machine.
