Okay, so I have to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The user is experiencing two main issues with their QEMU setup: 

1. When starting Slackware in QEMU using 'Zoom To Fit', they see two mouse pointers and when scrolling fast, it moves them to another virtual desktop.
2. This issue doesn't occur if they start in full-screen mode or switch to it afterward.

They also mention that the problem is resolved without '-usbdevice tablet' but they prefer having seamless mouse movement with this option enabled.

Looking at the categories provided: 

- The mouse issues seem related to how QEMU handles input devices, especially the USB device configuration.
- The presence of two pointers and incorrect pointer behavior suggests an issue with the USB device handling or the way QEMU interfaces with the host's input drivers.

Considering the possible categories:

- **device** likely refers to hardware devices in the virtual machine, which includes USB devices. Since the user is specifically using '-usbdevice tablet', this points to a problem related to the USB device configuration.
  
Other categories like **graphic**, **network**, or **socket** don't seem to fit as well because the issues are about mouse pointers and behavior, not graphics rendering or network-related bugs.

So, I think the category is **device** since it's about how QEMU handles USB devices for input, leading to incorrect pointer behavior.

The issue revolves around the handling of the USB tablet device in QEMU, causing incorrect mouse pointer behavior. This falls under the **device** category as it pertains to hardware device management.
