Alright, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU. The title says "Make ivshmem more generic not only a PCI device." So, the issue is about the ivshmem component being tied too closely to the PCI device model.

Looking at the possible categories: device makes sense because it's related to hardware devices in QEMU. Other options like network or graphic don't fit here since the problem isn't about networking or graphics. The report suggests making ivshmem more generic, which implies expanding beyond justPCI, so 'device' seems appropriate.

The bug report is about making ivshmem more generic and portable, moving away from being solely a PCI device. This relates to how devices are handled in QEMU.

**Answer:**
device
