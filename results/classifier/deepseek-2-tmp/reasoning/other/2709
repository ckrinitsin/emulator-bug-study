Alright, I need to classify the bug report "Contributing to docs is very confusing" into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, let me analyze what the bug report is about. The user is expressing frustration with the process of contributing to the documentation, finding it confusing. Now, I need to see which category this falls under.

Looking at the possible categories, none seem directly related to documentation or the process of contributing. Categories like 'other' are a catch-all for issues that don't fit into more specific ones. Since the issue isn't about translation errors, assembly problems, devices, graphics, sockets, network issues, KVM, booting, VNC, debugging, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, or hypervisors, it doesn't fit into any of those.

Therefore, the most appropriate category for this bug report is 'other' because it's a general issue not covered by the other specific categories.

The bug report pertains to the documentation process and does not fall under any of the specified technical categories. Therefore, the correct classification is:

**other**
