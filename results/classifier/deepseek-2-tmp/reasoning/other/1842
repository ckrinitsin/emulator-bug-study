Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. Let me read it carefully.

The user mentioned a regression in version 8.1.0 related to keyutils and meson during the build. The issue is that keyutils isn't found by meson anymore. They provided a commit link where `config-host.h` has `#undef CONFIG_KEYUTILS`, which seems suspicious because if it's undefined, maybe the code doesn't recognize the feature.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

This bug is about build configurationâ€”meson not finding a dependency (keyutils). The problem lies in how the build system includes or excludes certain features. Since keyutils isn't being linked, it's related to the build process rather than runtime issues.

None of the categories directly relate to build configurations. Mistranslation and assembly lowering are more about code generation. Other seems too broad, but maybe applicable here because it's not fitting into specific technical areas like network or kernel.

So, the best fit is probably 'other' since it doesn't fall under the listed specific categories.
