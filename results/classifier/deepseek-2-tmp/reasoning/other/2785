Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me look at the problem description carefully.

The user says they can't build QEMU after adding the latest NBD docs. The error message mentions a duplicate label 'nbd' in two different files: qemu-block-drivers.rst.inc and images.rst. This is causing the build to fail because of a warning that's treated as an error.

Looking at the categories provided, I see options like mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, etc. The issue here isn't related to translation or assembly; it's more about documentation duplication causing build failure.

The problem arises during the build process when generating the manual with Sphinx. The duplicate label is a documentation issue that's being flagged by the build system. Since excluding NBD from the targets fixes the build, it points towards a documentation-related problem rather than a functional one.

So, considering all categories, 'other' seems appropriate because it's not fitting into any specific category like device or network but is a build-time error due to duplicate labels in the docs.
