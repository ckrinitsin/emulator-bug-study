Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "Issue template broken". The categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the issue is about the "template" being broken. Since it's an issue template, it likely refers to a form or structure used when reporting bugs, not related to the actual code functionality like translation or assembly errors. 

Looking at the categories, most don't fit here. It doesn't relate to hardware components like devices, graphics, sockets, or network issues. KVM is about virtualization, which isn't mentioned. Boot, VNC, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, and hypervisor also don't seem relevant.

The only category left that could encompass a problem with reporting mechanisms is "other", as it's not tied to any specific feature or component but rather the process of reporting issues itself.
