Okay, so I have this bug report that says "scripts/archive-source.sh is not documented." I need to classify it into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Let me think about what each category means. The script in question is archive-source.sh, and it's part of QEMU. It sounds like a shell script used for some automated process within the project, perhaps related to source code management or build processes. 

The issue here isn't about how something is translated between architectures (so not mistranslation). It doesn't relate directly to assembly code or any specific device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, VNC, debug features, performance issues, kernel modules, peripherals, or hypervisor functions.

The problem is that the script isn't documented. Documentation typically falls under the category of 'other' because it's more about process and user experience rather than a specific technical component. It doesn't fit into any of the other predefined categories like files (which would relate to file handling issues), permissions (access control), etc.

So, considering all these factors, the most appropriate category is 'other'.
