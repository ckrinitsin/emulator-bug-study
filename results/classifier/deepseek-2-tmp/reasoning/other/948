Alright, I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

Looking at the error message, it's during the build process where 'config-poison.h' is missing. The compilation fails because this header isn't found. The user mentioned that 6.2.0 works but 7.0-rc0, rc1, and rc2 have the issue.

I know that QEMU relies on certain headers generated during configuration. If 'config-poison.h' isn't being generated, it's likely a problem with how the build system is handling dependencies or configurations.

This doesn't seem to be related to translation (mistranslation), assembly lowering (assembly), or any specific hardware components like devices, graphics, sockets, etc. It also doesn't point to network, KVM, VNC issues, or hypervisor-related problems directly.

The problem arises during compilation, indicating a build configuration issue rather than runtime errors. The missing header suggests that the configure script isn't generating all necessary files correctly. This could be an oversight in the Makefile or build dependencies not being properly handled.

Since it's related to build configuration and file generation, but doesn't fit into any of the specific categories like network or KVM, the most appropriate category is likely 'other'.

The issue revolves around a missing header file during compilation, pointing to a configuration problem in the build process rather than specific hardware or software features.
