Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The problem is about incorrect SPDX license expressions in the source code.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is related to licensing syntax. It's about using the wrong terms in license expressions. Since it's not about code translation or any of the listed specific components like devices or networking, it falls under something that doesn't fit into those categories. The issue is with documentation and licensing compliance rather than functionality.

Therefore, the appropriate category is 'other'.
