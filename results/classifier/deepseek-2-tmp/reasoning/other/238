Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "capstone link failure building linux-user static". The user has given possible categories like mistranslation, assembly lowering, etc., and wants just the single word category.

First, let's break down the bug report. It mentions "capstone link failure" which likely refers to a linking issue during the build process of QEMU, specifically for the Linux user-mode part. The term "linking" here is related to the build process, not necessarily the runtime.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation relates to semantic mapping issues, which doesn't fit here. Assembly lowering is about converting code from higher-level to assembly, which might be part of compilation but not directly linking. Other categories like device, graphic, network, etc., don't seem relevant either.

The issue is during the build process, so it's not related to runtime problems with KVM, VNC, or peripherals. It's more about the build tools or libraries. Capstone is a disassembly framework used in QEMU for translation. If there's a link failure when building, it might be due to issues with how Capstone is integrated into the build process.

Since this isn't directly related to user-mode assembly or translation but rather a build-time linking issue involving Capstone, the best fit from the categories given would be "other". It doesn't neatly fall into mistranslation or assembly lowering. Alternatively, if there were a category for build system issues, that might be more precise, but since it's not listed, "other" seems appropriate.
