Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is reporting that certain Kconfig-related options aren't showing up when they run `./configure --help`. Specifically, the options `--with-default-devices` and `--without-default-devices` are missing from the help output.

First, I'll recall the possible categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue here is about configuration options not being documented. The `./configure --help` command typically lists all the available options for the build configuration. If some options aren't appearing there, it suggests a problem with how these options are handled in the configure script or Kconfig files.

Looking at the categories, I need to determine which one fits best. "Other" is a general category for things that don't fit into other specific areas. Since this issue isn't directly related to any of the more specific categories like device, network, or kernel, it's likely classified under "other." 

I should consider if there's a better fit. For instance, could this be a problem with how options are translated (mistranslation)? But mistranslation usually refers to incorrect mapping in code translation, not missing documentation. So, no, that doesn't seem right.

Therefore, the most appropriate category for this bug report is "other."
