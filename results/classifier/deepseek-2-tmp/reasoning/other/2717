Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report about QEMU. Let's read through the details provided.

The issue is that when someone follows a link in the documentation for QEMU's RISC-V semihosting, they end up with a 404 error. The steps to reproduce involve opening a specific page in the docs, going to the Supported Targets section, clicking on the RISC-V link, and then getting a 404. 

The user provided the old URL which is no longer working and mentioned that the new correct URL should be used instead. They included both URLs: the old one pointing to a QEMU GitLab page and the new one pointing to a GitHub repository.

Looking at the possible categories, I need to determine which one fits best. The options are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and so on.

This bug is related to documentation linking. The problem isn't with the code's translation or assembly; it's about an incorrect link in the documentation. Since the category 'other' is available for issues that don't fit into other specific categories, this seems appropriate.

Alternatively, I might consider if there's a more precise category like 'documentation', but since that's not listed, 'other' is the best fit.

The issue is about an incorrect link in the documentation. The correct category is:

**other**
