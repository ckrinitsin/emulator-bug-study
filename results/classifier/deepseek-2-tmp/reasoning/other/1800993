Okay, I need to classify this bug report into the given categories. The user is asking about migrating a VM built from QEMU source code on Ubuntu 16.04 using VNC. They mentioned following the wiki guide and successfully installed QEMU with a VM created via VNC server.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user isn't reporting a bug per se but seeking guidance on VM migration. Since it's about VM migration and not a specific error or feature, the closest category would be 'other' because their question doesn't fit into any of the listed technical categories like network or vnc. They might need help with moving the VM's files or configuration between hosts, which could fall under 'files' but since that's not explicitly mentioned, 'other' is safer.
