Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The user is suggesting a feature request related to prebuilt testing Docker images for QEMU. They want that instead of building the images locally, we should pull them from CI platforms like Travis, Shippable, or GitLab by default. Only when manually requested should we build it ourselves.

Now, looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

I need to figure out which category this fits into. The main point here is about Docker images and how they're built or sourced. Docker relates to containerization, but in the context of QEMU, it's part of the testing environment setup.

Looking at the categories, none directly mention Docker or containers. But since this is a feature request regarding prebuilt images for testing, which doesn't fall under any specific bug category like network, kernel, etc., it's more about how the project handles its build and test procedures. Therefore, the closest category would be 'other' because it's not fitting into the provided technical categories but is still an important aspect of the project setup.
