Alright, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user is talking about the alphabetical order of monitor options in QEMU. They noticed that the 'c|cont' option wasn't in the right place alphabetically, which made them overlook it initially. They provided a list of commands and showed that when sorted, 'c|cont' comes before others like 'change', 'commit', etc.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

This bug is about the ordering of monitor commands in QEMU's interface. It doesn't relate to any specific component like networking or devices but rather how options are presented. The issue is with usability and presentation, not a functional bug. Therefore, it falls under 'other' because none of the other categories fit this non-functional issue.
