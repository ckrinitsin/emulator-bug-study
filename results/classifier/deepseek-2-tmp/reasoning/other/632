Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. The user provided possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, and others like device, graphic, socket, etc.

The bug report says, "We should document 'make install DESTDIR=wherever'". Hmm, that sounds like a documentation issue rather than a technical bug in QEMU itself. The person is pointing out something missing in the documentation about using DESTDIR with make install.

Looking at the categories, none of them directly relate to documentation or user instructions. Categories like network, device, or hypervisor don't fit here. So, I think this falls under 'other' because it's not a bug related to any specific component but rather an omission in the documentation.

The issue is about missing documentation, which doesn't fall into any technical category provided. 

category: other
