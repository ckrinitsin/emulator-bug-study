Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned a problem during the build process of Yocto/Bitbake related tools, specifically with QEMU 2.2.0. They encountered an issue in the "SDL probe" configuration step where the test linking failed because it couldn't find libncursesw.

Hmm, so the bug is about a missing library causing a compile error during the build process. The user had to manually install libncursesw5-dev to fix it. They also provided a quick hack by modifying the configure script's sdl_libs variable. 

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

This issue is related to missing dependencies during configuration and build time, specifically with SDL development libraries. Since it's a build configuration problem involving external libraries (libncursesw) and not directly tied to any of the listed specific categories like network or graphics, it doesn't fit into those. It's more about the setup and dependencies rather than an issue within QEMU itself. 

So, the most appropriate category is likely "other" because it doesn't fall under the provided specialized categories but relates to build configuration issues.
