Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through the information carefully.

The issue is with QEMU version 1:6.0+dfsg-2expubuntu2 failing to build against OpenSSL 3.0. The error message points to a deprecated function in create-container.c, specifically EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY being deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0. The build log shows this as an error because warnings are treated as errors.

So, the problem is related to QEMU's build process when using a newer version of OpenSSL. Since OpenSSL 3.0 has deprecated some functions that QEMU (or its components like skiboot) still uses, it's causing a build failure.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and others.

This isn't directly related to device drivers, graphics, sockets, or networking. It also doesn't seem like a KVM issue or anything related to virtualization beyond the build process. The problem is more about compatibility with OpenSSL 3.0 in the build environment rather than QEMU's runtime features.

The error occurs during compilation, so it's not a runtime bug but a build-time issue. Since it's related to deprecated functions and build configurations (since they mention adding -Wno-deprecated-declarations), I'm thinking it might fall under 'other' because it doesn't fit into the specific categories like performance or kernel.

Wait, let me check if there's another category that could better describe this. It involves libraries and compatibility, which is a general issue rather than a specific component of QEMU. So yes, 'other' seems appropriate.

The bug report relates to build issues due to deprecated function usage when compiling against OpenSSL 3.0. This doesn't fit into the specified categories like performance or kernel but is a general build problem.
