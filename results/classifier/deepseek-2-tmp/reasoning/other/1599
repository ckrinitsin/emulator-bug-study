Okay, so I need to classify this bug report based on the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user mentioned "Windows installer" and is asking to release one for version 7.2.1. They provided a link to the download page. The steps to reproduce aren't detailed since it's more of a feature request than an actual bug.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

This isn't about any specific component like networking or graphics. It's not a translation issue or related to assembly. The request is about the installer, which is part of the distribution package, not the core functionality. Installer-related issues don't fit into most of the listed categories since they're more about packaging and release management.

So the best category here would be "other" because it doesn't fall under any specific technical component but is a general request regarding the availability of an installer.
