Okay, let's see what this bug report is about. The user is talking about running 'make docker-test-build' and then trying to cancel it with Ctrl+C. But when they do that, the Docker containers keep running instead of stopping. 

Hmm, so the issue is related to how QEMU handles Docker builds. When you press ^C, you're sending a SIGINT signal to the process, which should ideally terminate it. But in this case, the build isn't being canceled; the containers are still up.

I need to categorize this bug. Looking at the possible categories: hypervisor, kernel, user-mode assembly, etc. This seems more about how QEMU interacts with Docker and manages its processes when interrupted. 

Wait, 'make docker-test-build' probably starts some build process using Docker. When you cancel it, maybe the make command stops, but any backgrounded Docker containers keep running because they're separate processes.

So this isn't a translation issue or an assembly problem. It's more about how QEMU handles its own processes when interrupted. Since Docker is involved and the containers aren't being killed, it might be related to process management within the build script.

The categories don't include 'process management' per se, but looking at the options, 'hypervisor' or maybe 'other' could fit. But since it's about how QEMU manages its own test builds with Docker, perhaps it's best categorized under 'other' as it doesn't neatly fit into any of the specific categories listed.

Wait, noâ€”maybe 'build' is an option? Let me check again. The possible categories are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

No 'build' category, so the closest would be 'other'. Alternatively, if it's about how QEMU handles processes when interrupted, perhaps it's related to the build process but not directly any of the listed categories. So I think 'other' is the right choice.

The bug report describes an issue where interrupting a QEMU build process with `^C` does not stop running Docker containers. The problem lies in how the build script interacts with Docker, specifically failing to terminate child processes when interrupted. Since this doesn't fit into any of the specific categories like mistranslation or assembly issues, it falls under the 'other' category.
