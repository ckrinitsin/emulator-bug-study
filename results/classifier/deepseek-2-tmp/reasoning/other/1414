Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is with the configure script using "pkg-config" directly instead of "$pkg_config". This affects cross-compilation because it pulls GLIB_VERSION from the host system's glib instead of the cross-compiled one. The fix involves modifying line 2420 to use $pkg_config as correctly done elsewhere (line 1476).

Looking at the categories, "mistranslation" refers to incorrect mapping in source to target. However, this isn't a translation issue but rather a script configuration problem. It's not related to assembly lowering either.

The bug is about using the wrong variable in a script during cross-compilation, which affects how GLIB_VERSION is determined. Since it's an issue with the build configuration and toolchain usage, the most appropriate category might be "other" because it doesn't fit into the specific hardware-related or performance categories.
