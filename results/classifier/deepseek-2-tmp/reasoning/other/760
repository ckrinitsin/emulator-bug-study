Alright, I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user provided a list of categories and wants me to choose just one based on their description.

The bug report says: "Feature request: QEMU can report its building options." It's not exactly a bug but a feature request. So, looking at the possible categories, I need to see which fits best.

The options are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Since it's a feature request about reporting build options, it doesn't fit into any specific category like network or graphics. It also isn't related to debugging or performance. The closest might be 'other' because it's not a traditional bug but rather a new feature request that doesn't fall under the listed categories.

I think the best category here is 'other'. It covers anything that doesn't fit into the more specific ones.

The bug report is about requesting a feature, specifically for QEMU to report its build options. This doesn't fit into any of the provided categories like network or hypervisor but falls under general features.
