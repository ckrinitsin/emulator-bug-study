Okay, so I need to classify the bug report about accessing raw partitions from Windows using QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the possible categories again: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user is talking about using a Windows tablet that makes USB booting impossible. They want to access raw partitions via QEMU to run Linux installers. They mention successfully installing boot loaders with UEFI, so they think this feature would be helpful.

Hmm. The main issue here isn't directly about any of the technical categories like assembly or network. It's more about being able to use QEMU to access and interact with raw disk partitions for installation purposes. Since the user is using a tablet that can't boot via USB, they're looking for an alternative way through QEMU.

Looking at the categories, 'files' could be related since it involves accessing files on a partition. But another possibility is 'boot' because they want to install Linux and set up boot loaders. However, the primary request isn't about the booting process itself but about gaining access to raw partitions in QEMU to facilitate that.

I think 'device' might not fit here because it's more about disk partitions rather than hardware devices themselves. The user is talking about accessing the partition as a virtual device within QEMU, so maybe 'files' or 'peripherals' could be relevant. However, 'other' is also an option if none of the specific categories quite match.

Wait, perhaps 'hypervisor' since QEMU acts as a hypervisor when using KVM for full virtualization. The user wants to run Linux installers within QEMU, which relates to the hypervisor's capabilities. But I'm not entirely sure because the request is more about partition access than the hypervisor functionality itself.

Alternatively, considering that this feature would allow accessing raw disks for installation, it might fall under 'files' if it's about file system handling or 'peripherals' since it involves disk devices. However, none of these perfectly capture the user's need for a new feature to access raw partitions.

I'm leaning towards 'other' because the specific category that would fit isn't listed. The user is suggesting an enhancement rather than reporting a bug per se, but within the given options, 'other' seems appropriate as it doesn't neatly fall into any other predefined category.
