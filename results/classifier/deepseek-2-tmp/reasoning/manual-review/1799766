Alright, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user is having trouble ejecting a floppy device in QEMU's monitor mode. They tried using the 'eject fda' command but got an error saying the device isn't found. The same issue happens with the 'change' command.

Looking at their setup, they're using various blockdev and global options to configure the floppy drive. When they use '-drive' instead of '-device', it works because the eject command finds 'floppy0'. But when they use '-blockdev' and set 'isa-fdc.driveA=fda', the device isn't found.

The problem seems related to how devices are registered in QEMU's internal structures. When using '-drive', the device is properly named and recognized, but with '-blockdev' and global settings, it might not be correctly linked or named as expected by the monitor commands.

This likely points to an issue in how device nodes are created or referenced when configuring drives via blockdev and global options versus the more straightforward '-drive' command. The user correctly notes that using '-device' is recommended, suggesting that their approach with blockdev might not be fully compatible or properly set up for certain operations like eject.

The key here is that the issue arises from device configuration methods rather than any hardware emulation flaw. It's about how devices are named and registered in the QEMU runtime environment. Therefore, this would fall under a problem related to device management or node registration.

The bug report pertains to an issue with device naming and registration when configuring floppy drives using blockdev and global options instead of the '-drive' command. This causes commands like 'eject' and 'change' to fail because the device isn't recognized properly.

**Classification: Device Management / Node Registration Issue**

This is categorized under "Device Management" as it relates to how devices are named and registered within QEMU, affecting their recognition by management commands.
