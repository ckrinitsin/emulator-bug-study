Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the provided categories for QEMU. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The issue is with mice using relative movement when using SDL display under Linux guests. It specifically mentions `-device virtio-mouse` and `-device usb-mouse`, which are causing jittery motion only when using `-display sdl`. This doesn't happen with other display configurations like GTK or Spice-Viewer, and interestingly, it's not an issue in Windows guests with the same setup.

The user also notes that running `evtest` on the problematic mouse shows less apparent issues. So, it seems like the problem is related to how the mouse events are handled under SDL in QEMU when running a Linux guest.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem involves mouse input and display configuration. Since it's specific to SDL and devices like virtio-mouse or usb-mouse, I'm leaning towards 'peripherals' as the category because it deals with device input handling. Alternatively, it could be 'graphic' if it relates to how the display is rendering, but since the issue is more about mouse events not being processed correctly, peripherals seems more accurate.

Wait, but peripherals might include all kinds of devices, whereas this is specifically a mouse which is an input device. However, in QEMU's context, devices are often categorized under 'peripherals' when dealing with hardware emulation. So yes, I think 'peripherals' fits here.

The bug report involves incorrect handling of relative mouse movements under the SDL display configuration in Linux guests. This affects specific mouse devices and their behavior within the virtual environment. The issue is tied to how input events are processed when using certain display settings, particularly SDL, which suggests it's related to device or peripheral emulation.

**Answer: peripherals**

The problem pertains to the handling of mouse devices under a specific display configuration, pointing to an issue with how peripherals (specifically input devices) are managed in QEMU.
