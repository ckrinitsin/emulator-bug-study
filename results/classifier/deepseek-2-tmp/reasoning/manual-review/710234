Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user mentioned that QEMU segfaults at startup regardless of whether an image is provided or not. They tried both the latest development version and qemu-0.13.0, so it's not isolated to a specific release.

The first thing I notice is that the issue occurs when starting QEMU, which suggests something goes wrong during initialization. The user also mentioned that even with the -nographic option, it still segfaults, implying it's not related to graphical output. 

They tried recompiling without KVM support because they're running a 32-bit OS on a 64-bit CPU, but that didn't help. So the problem isn't necessarily tied to KVM acceleration.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Since the issue happens during startup and it's not related to graphics, network, sockets, or VNC, those can be ruled out. It's also not a permission or file issue because they tried different versions without any image provided. 

The mention of KVM being disabled suggests that the problem isn't tied directly to the hypervisor layer but might be in the kernel mode (since QEMU uses KVM for virtualization). However, since KVM was disabled, perhaps it's related to how QEMU initializes other components.

Another angle is the boot process. If QEMU segfaults when starting up, it could be an issue during the initialization phase of the emulator, which might fall under 'boot' category as it's failing early in the process.

I think the best fit here would be 'boot' because the problem occurs at startup and isn't linked to any specific feature like graphics or network. It's about QEMU crashing before it can fully boot up.

The issue described is related to QEMU segfaulting during startup, which suggests a problem in the initialization phase of the emulator. Since this happens regardless of whether an image is provided, and it doesn't seem linked to specific features like graphics or network, the most appropriate category is:

**boot**

This classification captures issues that occur when the program starts up or initializes, fitting the described bug where QEMU fails immediately upon launch.
