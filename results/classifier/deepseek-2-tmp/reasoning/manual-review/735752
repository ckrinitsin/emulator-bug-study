Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where there's a crash in QEMU/KVM on a Linux system. The user provided some logs and the output from running `ps ax|grep qemu`. Let me try to figure out what's going wrong here.

First, the log entries mention something about CR2 being 0 and then an end trace with a specific identifier. I know that in kernel logs, when there's a crash or a trap, you often see these kinds of messages. CR2 refers to the second column register in x86 architecture, which holds the address of the instruction that caused a page fault. If it's zero, maybe the system tried to access an invalid memory location.

Looking at the QEMU processes running, there are two instances: one named 'dc1' and another 'transarchive'. Both are using KVM with different amounts of memory (512MB and 1024MB respectively). The 'dc1' VM is using a Cirrus VGA adapter, while 'transarchive' uses the standard VGA. Also, 'transarchive' has vhost=on for its network interface, which I think is related to better performance but could be causing issues if not properly configured.

I remember that when dealing with KVM crashes, the kernel logs can provide clues. The CR2 being zero suggests a null pointer dereference or accessing an invalid address. This could be due to a bug in QEMU itself or maybe in a driver or module loaded by the VM.

I should also check if there are any known issues with the versions of QEMU and libvirt being used. The user has qemu-kvm-0.13.0-r2 and libvirt-0.8.8-r1, which might be older versions. Perhaps there were bugs in these versions that have been fixed in later releases.

Another thing to consider is whether the VMs are properly configured. Maybe one of them is causing excessive memory usage or conflicting with hardware resources. The network settings could also be a factor since 'transarchive' has vhost enabled, which might require specific kernel modules or configurations.

I should think about how to approach solving this. Updating QEMU and libvirt to newer versions might resolve any known bugs. Checking the VM configurations for errors or conflicts is also important. Maybe running the VMs with different hardware settings could help identify if a particular component is causing the crash.

Also, looking at the full kernel logs around the time of the crash could provide more context. Are there any other error messages before the CR2 line? That might give a clue about what triggered the issue.

In summary, the possible causes are:

1. Bug in QEMU/KVM versions used.
2. Configuration issues with VM hardware or settings.
3. Kernel modules not properly loaded for certain devices (like vhost networking).
4. Memory corruption leading to invalid memory accesses.

I'll need to suggest updating the software, checking configurations, and reviewing kernel logs for more detailed errors.

The issue appears to be a crash in the QEMU/KVM environment on your Linux system, potentially due to a bug or configuration error. Here's how you can address it:

1. **Update Software**: Upgrade QEMU and libvirt to newer versions to benefit from bug fixes and improvements.

2. **Review Configuration**: Check each VM's configuration for any errors, especially network settings (e.g., vhost) that might require specific kernel modules or configurations.

3. **Inspect Kernel Logs**: Look at the full kernel logs around the crash time for additional error messages that could pinpoint the cause.

4. **Test with Different Settings**: Consider running VMs with adjusted hardware configurations to isolate if a particular component is causing the issue.

5. **Check for Memory Issues**: Ensure there's no memory corruption or overcommitment affecting QEMU processes.

By addressing these areas, you can identify and resolve the root cause of the crash.
