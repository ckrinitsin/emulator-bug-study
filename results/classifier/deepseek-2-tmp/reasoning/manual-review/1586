Okay, I'm trying to help someone who's encountering errors while building QEMU using the provided steps. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the error messages, it seems that during the tests, QEMU is being killed by signal 6 (SIGABRT), which usually indicates an assertion failure or some kind of abort in the code. The specific errors point to issues in `pci_expander_bridge.c` and `allwinner-i2c.h`, where objects are not instances of expected types.

The user provided steps to reproduce, including building from SRPMs and running tests via mock. So, I think the issue is arising during the build or test phase when using these specific packages and patches.

I need to figure out why QEMU is crashing with these errors. Let's break down each error:

1. **PCI Expander Bridge Issues:**
   - The first set of errors occur in `pci_expander_bridge.c` at line 54, where an object isn't recognized as type `pxb`. This suggests a problem during the creation or initialization of this device. Maybe there's a missing or incorrect registration when creating devices.

2. **Allwinner I2C Issues:**
   - The second set is in `allwinner-i2c.h`, again with objects not matching the expected type. Perhaps there's an issue with how the I2C devices are being instantiated or their initialization code is wrong.

3. **Possible Causes:**
   - It could be that a patch introduced after QEMU 7.2 caused these issues. The user mentioned using QEMU 8.0, so maybe something changed in the device registration process.
   - Another possibility is that the build environment or dependencies have changed, leading to miscompiled code or missing symbols.

4. **Steps to Diagnose:**
   - Check if all required dependencies are properly installed and up-to-date.
   - Look into the `hw/pci-bridge` and `hw/i2c` directories in QEMU's source for any recent changes affecting these devices.
   - Verify that during compilation, all object files correctly reference their types. Maybe there's an issue with how classes or structs are being defined.

5. **Potential Solutions:**
   - Rebuilding after cleaning the build directory thoroughly might help if it's a caching issue.
   - Ensuring that any patches applied are compatible and correctly merged into QEMU 8.0.
   - Compiling with debug information enabled could provide more detailed stack traces to pinpoint where exactly the assertion is failing.

6. **Testing the Build:**
   - After making changes, running unit tests or specific test cases related to these devices might catch issues early.
   - Using a debugger like GDB to attach to QEMU when it crashes can give more insight into which exact line is causing the abort.

7. **Reviewing the Code:**
   - Looking at `pci_expander_bridge.c`, ensuring that all instances of `PXB_DEV` are correctly handled and that their types match where they're being used.
   - Similarly, in `allwinner-i2c.h`, checking how `AW_I2C` objects are created and whether any initialization steps are missing or incorrect.

8. **Checking for Known Issues:**
   - Searching QEMU's bug tracker or forums to see if others have encountered similar issues when updating from 7.2 to 8.0.
   - Reviewing commit history around the areas mentioned in the errors to see what changes might have introduced these bugs.

9. **Reverting Changes:**
   - If a specific change caused the issue, reverting it or applying a patch that fixes the problem without breaking other parts of QEMU would be necessary.

10. **Seeking Help:**
    - If stuck, reaching out to the QEMU community or relevant forums for assistance could provide new perspectives and solutions.

In summary, the errors are likely due to issues in specific device initializations within QEMU 8.0. To resolve this, I'll need to check the affected code areas, ensure all dependencies are correct, and possibly debug with more detailed information.

To address the issue where QEMU crashes during build or test with SIGABRT errors related to device type mismatches, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify the Problematic Areas:**
   - The errors occur in `hw/pci-bridge/pci_expander_bridge.c` and `hw/i2c/allwinner-i2c.h`, indicating issues with device initialization.

2. **Check for Code Changes:**
   - Review any patches or updates introduced in QEMU 8.0 that might affect these devices, especially around the areas where the errors are occurring.

3. **Rebuild with Debug Information:**
   - Compile QEMU with debug symbols to get more detailed error messages and stack traces when the assertion fails.

4. **Inspect Object Instantiation:**
   - Ensure that all instances of `PXB_DEV` and `AW_I2C` are correctly created and initialized, matching their expected types where they're used.

5. **Test Specific Cases:**
   - Run specific test cases or unit tests focusing on the affected devices to isolate and reproduce the issue more easily.

6. **Use a Debugger:**
   - Use GDB to attach to QEMU when it crashes. This will allow you to see exactly where in the code the assertion is failing, providing clues for fixing the issue.

7. **Review Dependencies:**
   - Ensure all required libraries and dependencies are properly installed and compatible with QEMU 8.0.

8. **Check Build Environment:**
   - Verify that the build environment (including compiler version, flags, etc.) is correct and hasn't introduced any issues.

9. **Search for Known Issues:**
   - Look up similar problems in QEMU's issue tracker or community forums to see if others have encountered and resolved these issues.

10. **Apply Fixes and Rebuild:**
    - Once the specific cause is identified, apply the necessary fixes (e.g., correcting device initialization code) and rebuild QEMU to test if the problem is resolved.

### Solution Code:

Here's how you can set up debugging and verify the build environment:

```bash
# Compile QEMU with debug information
./configure --enable-debug --prefix=/usr/local/qemu-debug
make

# Install QEMU for debugging purposes
sudo make install

# Start QEMU in GDB to catch the crash
 gdb -ex "run" --args /usr/local/qemu-debug/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 [your launch arguments]
```

### Explanation:

- **Compilation with Debug Info:** By enabling debug mode, you get more detailed error messages which can help pinpoint where the crash occurs.
  
- **Using GDB:** Attaching QEMU to a debugger allows you to inspect the state at the time of the crash, providing insights into why the assertion failed.

- **Testing Specific Cases:** Running individual tests related to the failing devices helps isolate issues without dealing with the entire test suite.

By systematically checking each of these areas and using the provided commands, you should be able to identify and fix the root cause of the crashes in QEMU.
