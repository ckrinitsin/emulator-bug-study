Okay, so I have this bug report about QEMU where a drive-backup using iSCSI is failing with "Invalid argument". Let me try to figure out what's going on.

First, the user set up an iSCSI target using targetcli and created the necessary LUNs. Then they tried using the drive-backup command in libvirt to back up to that iSCSI target. The first attempt failed but worked on the second try. This pattern suggests something isn't initialized properly on the first run.

Looking at the categories, I need to classify this under one of them: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

The error is about creating an image with an invalid argument. Since it's related to the iSCSI protocol and drive operations, it's likely a problem with how QEMU interacts with the storage device. The initial failure might be due to the target not being ready when the backup attempt is made for the first time.

I think this could fall under 'device' because it's about interacting with a block device or storage peripheral. Alternatively, maybe it's related to network since iSCSI is a network protocol, but the error seems more about the storage setup rather than networking issues.

Another angle: drive-backup probably uses the QEMU img tool or similar for backing up images. If there's an issue with how the target is being accessed, it might be a problem in the device handling within QEMU. Alternatively, if it's related to permissions or protocol handling, maybe 'network' could be relevant.

Wait, but the user mentioned that after restarting the VM, the first attempt still fails. This points more towards an initialization issue rather than a network connectivity problem. So perhaps it's not about the network stack but about how QEMU is configuring or accessing the device for the backup.

So considering all this, I think 'device' would be the most appropriate category because it's related to the interaction with the storage device (iSCSI target) during the backup process.

The bug report involves an issue where the first attempt to back up a drive using iSCSI fails with "Invalid argument," but subsequent attempts succeed. This likely relates to how QEMU interacts with the storage device, specifically when setting up the iSCSI connection for the backup operation.
