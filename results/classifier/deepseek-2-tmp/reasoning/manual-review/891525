Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what this log means and why the system is behaving the way it's described. Let me start by looking at the information given.

The user provided a log snippet with several lines starting with [    0.252970] followed by hexadecimal values and some call traces. They also mentioned that when "cpus=" is specified for each node explicitly, the guest boots fine.

First, I notice the log has addresses like ffffffff81475873 and others. These look like kernel addresses on a 64-bit system because they start with 'ffff'. The fact that there's a call trace suggests this might be part of a crash or an error message from the kernel.

The call trace shows functions like _raw_spin_lock_irq, alloc_pid, select_task_rq, wake_up_new_task, do_fork, load_TLS, __switch_to, kernel_thread, kthread, and others. These are all low-level kernel functions involved in process scheduling and thread management. 

The mention of "cpus=" suggests this is related to CPU affinity or allocation, possibly in a virtualization context since the user talks about a "guest" (like a VM). When cpus= is specified explicitly for each node, the guest boots fine, which implies that without this specification, there might be an issue.

Looking at the call trace, it stops at select_task_rq_fair with RIP pointing to 0x8104f4d4. The fact that it's in select_task_rq_fair suggests a problem in CPU scheduling, possibly when trying to select a task's CPU. Maybe there's a race condition or an issue with how CPUs are being allocated.

The user might be encountering a bug related to CPU affinity settings causing the guest OS not to boot properly unless cpus= is explicitly set. Alternatively, this could be a kernel panic due to improper handling of CPU allocation during process creation.

I should consider possible causes: maybe missing or conflicting CPU assignments in the configuration, leading to the kernel failing to allocate necessary resources for the guest. Without explicit cpus=, the system might not assign CPUs correctly, causing failures in processes like do_fork or alloc_pid.

To diagnose this, I would check the system's CPU configuration, ensure that each node's cpus are explicitly defined, and verify if setting them explicitly resolves the issue. If it does, then the problem is likely related to the way CPU assignments are handled when not specified.

The log snippet you've provided appears to be a kernel debug or crash log from a Linux system. The lines starting with `[    0.252970]` indicate timestamps and hexadecimal values, which could be addresses or other kernel-level information.

The call trace shows the sequence of functions that led to the current state. Here's a breakdown of some key points in the log:

1. **Call Trace Functions**:
   - `_raw_spin_lock_irq`: This function is related to spin locks, which are used for mutual exclusion in the kernel.
   - `alloc_pid`: This function allocates a process ID (PID).
   - `select_task_rq`: Selects the appropriate CPU (task queue) for a task.
   - `wake_up_new_task` and `do_fork`: These functions are related to process creation and scheduling.

2. **Hexadecimal Addresses**:
   The hexadecimal addresses like `ffffffff81475873` likely point to specific instructions in the kernel where the issue occurred. Without more context, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what's wrong, but these addresses can be useful for debugging with a kernel debugger or by examining the kernel source code.

3. **"cpus=" Configuration**:
   The mention of `cpus=` suggests that this is related to CPU affinity or scheduling in a virtualized environment (e.g., KVM/QEMU). When explicitly specifying CPUs for each node, the guest OS boots fine, which implies that without this configuration, there might be an issue with how CPUs are being allocated or scheduled.

4. **Possible Causes**:
   - A bug in the CPU allocation code when `cpus=` is not specified.
   - An issue with process creation (`alloc_pid`) or scheduling (`select_task_rq`).

5. **Debugging Steps**:
   - Check if this is a known issue in your kernel version or hypervisor.
   - Ensure that all CPUs are properly configured and assigned, especially in a virtualized environment.
   - Consider enabling more detailed debugging to capture the exact cause of the failure.

If you're experiencing this issue in a specific context (e.g., running a guest OS under KVM), make sure that your host system's CPU configuration is compatible with the guest's requirements.
