Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user mentioned that the GUI crashes on macOS Mojave when using either SDL or the default Cocoa interface. They provided a detailed error log with an exception related to NSException and a stack trace.

First, looking at the error message: it's a GUI-related crash because it mentions NSWindow and other GUI components in the stack trace. The problem started after upgrading from High Sierra to Mojave, which suggests something changed in how macOS handles GUI applications or in QEMU's integration with the new OS version.

The command line uses SDL, but since both SDL and Cocoa interfaces are affected, it points towards an issue with QEMU's GUI handling on Mojave. The crash occurs when trying to set the window frame, possibly due to changes in macOS's display services or thread management for GUI elements.

In QEMU, GUI components might run in a separate thread. If there's an issue with how these threads are managed or if there's a race condition, it could cause such crashes. Alternatively, new security policies in Mojave, like sandboxing or stricter memory controls, might be interfering with QEMU's processes.

Looking at the possible classifications:
- **gui**: Since the crash is related to GUI operations.
- **osx**: The issue occurs specifically on macOS.
- **crash**: It's a crash, so this category fits.
- **thread**: If threading issues are involved in the GUI management.
- **display**: Could relate to display services changes in Mojave affecting QEMU.

The primary classification is likely 'gui' because the crash is due to GUI operations. However, since it's macOS-specific and involves potential thread or display issues, other categories might also apply. But the most direct category is 'gui'.

**Classification:**

- **gui**: The bug is related to the graphical user interface.
- **osx**: It occurs specifically on macOS Mojave.

The crash is primarily due to GUI-related operations failing when running QEMU under macOS Mojave, possibly due to changes in how GUI applications are handled post-upgrade.
