Alright, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user provided a description about supporting horizontal mouse wheel scrolling in QEMU's emulated mouse. I remember that QEMU handles input devices, including mice and keyboards, through its device emulation.

The possible categories include 'device', which seems relevant here because it's about mouse hardware support. Other options like 'graphic' might be related to display issues, but this is specifically about the mouse input. 'Input' wasn't listed, but 'device' covers hardware devices.

I think the key point is that this bug is about enhancing the functionality of a device (mouse) in QEMU. Therefore, it's likely categorized under 'device'.
