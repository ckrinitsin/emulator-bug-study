Alright, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU not setting the VNC port correctly. The user mentioned that using -vnc with a specific port like 192.168.1.1:5804 results in an incorrect port (11704 instead of 5804). They also noted that previously, specifying just the port without a host worked fine.

First, I recall that QEMU handles VNC options with different syntax. The command line options for VNC can be tricky because they might require specific formats. In older versions, using -vnc :port could set the port correctly, but now it seems that specifying both host and port together isn't working as expected.

The user's example shows that when they use -vnc 192.168.1.1:5804, QEMU is interpreting it differently than intended. This suggests an issue with how the VNC server parses the command line arguments.

Looking at possible classifications, this seems related to how QEMU processes its command-line options. It might be a bug in the option parsing for VNC, where it's not correctly handling the host:port format. Alternatively, there could be a problem with how the port is being extracted and used when both host and port are provided.

I also consider that this isn't an issue with networking or drivers but rather with QEMU's own argument processing. So, the classification should point to a problem within QEMU's VNC handling, specifically in parsing command-line options related to VNC server configuration.

The bug report describes an issue where specifying a host and port together in the QEMU VNC option results in an incorrect port being used. This points to a problem with how QEMU parses VNC parameters when both host and port are provided.

**Classification:**  
- **Component:** QEMU's VNC server option parsing
- **Type:** Bug in command-line argument processing for VNC options

This classification highlights that the issue lies within QEMU's handling of VNC configuration through its command line interface, specifically when specifying a remote host and port together.
