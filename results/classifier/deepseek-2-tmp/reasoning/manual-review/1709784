Okay, so I'm having this problem where I can't get KVM to work on my Ubuntu 16.04.3 system after updating the kernel to the latest version. The error message I'm seeing looks like some kind of crash or issue with the hypervisor. Let me try to figure out what's going wrong here.

From the logs, it seems like when I run virt-install with an ISO image, there's a trace appearing which probably indicates a kernel panic or something similar related to KVM. The user mentioned that this started happening after updating from 4.4.0-83 to 4.4.0-89, so the issue is specific to the newer kernel.

Looking at the comments, Jason tried reinstalling with the HWE kernel (which I think is a Hardware Enablement one) but it didn't fix the problem when he was on 16.04.2. Then, after updating his 16.04.2 system, which worked before, to 16.04.3, he encountered the same issue. This suggests that the kernel update introduced a regression.

Gustavo looked into the kernel changes and found that two specific commits were part of this update. One commit (46a704f) was included in the newer kernels starting from version 88, but another commit (e470571) wasn't present. This missing commit might be causing the problem because it probably fixes an issue related to KVM on PPC systems.

So, the main issue seems to be that a necessary fix isn't being applied in the latest kernel image. The user is seeing this when trying to use virt-install and run a VM, which points to a problem with how KVM is handling somethingâ€”maybe related to transactional memory (TM) or hypervisor state.

I'm not entirely sure about all the details here, but it sounds like the kernel update added some code to preserve the userspace HTM state properly but didn't include the commit that ensures TM is enabled before accessing its registers. Without that, there's an inconsistency leading to a crash when running KVM.

The user suggests that they might need to either wait for a newer kernel that includes both commits or find a workaround until this is fixed. Alternatively, using an older kernel where this issue doesn't occur could be a temporary solution.

I think the next steps would be to check if there's an update available that includes both necessary commits or if it's a known bug in the Ubuntu kernel package. Maybe reaching out to the Ubuntu Kernel team or looking into their bug tracker for similar issues would help find a fix.

The issue you're encountering with KVM on your Ubuntu 16.04.3 system after updating to the latest kernel is likely due to a missing commit that was necessary for proper KVM functionality. Here's how you can address it:

### Problem Analysis:
- **Kernel Update**: The problem arose after updating to kernel version 4.4.0-89, which included some but not all relevant commits.
- **Missing Commit**: The commit `e470571` wasn't included in the updated kernel, causing an inconsistency in KVM handling.

### Solution:
1. **Check Kernel Version**:
   - Ensure your kernel is up-to-date or consider using a version that includes both necessary commits (e.g., 4.4.0-89 and beyond if available).

2. **Revert to an Older Kernel (Temporary Fix)**:
   - If the issue persists in newer kernels, revert to a previous version where KVM worked correctly.

3. **Report the Issue**:
   - Contact the Ubuntu Kernel team or report a bug on their tracker to request inclusion of the missing commit in future updates.

### Conclusion:
Until both commits are included in your kernel, you might need to use an older kernel or wait for an updated version that resolves this issue.
