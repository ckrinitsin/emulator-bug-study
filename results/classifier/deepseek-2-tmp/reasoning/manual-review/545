Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "Abort in ohci_frame_boundary". Let's break it down.

First, "ohci" stands for Open Host Controller Interface, which is related to USB controllers in QEMU. The function name "ohci_frame_boundary" suggests it's part of the OHCI emulation code. 

The term "Abort" here likely means that something unexpected happened during execution, leading to a crash or error in this specific function.

Looking at the categories provided: device makes sense because OHCI is part of the USB controller device emulation in QEMU. Other options like kernel, hypervisor, or network don't fit as well since the issue is tied to hardware device emulation rather than those areas.

So, the bug relates to a device (specifically USB), so it falls under the 'device' category.

The bug report involves an abort occurring in the `ohci_frame_boundary` function. Since OHCI pertains to USB controller emulation, which is a type of hardware device, the appropriate category is:

**device**

This classification makes sense because the issue relates to how QEMU emulates hardware devices, specifically USB controllers.

```json
{
  "category": "device"
}
