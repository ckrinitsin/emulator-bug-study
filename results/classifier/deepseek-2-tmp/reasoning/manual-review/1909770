Alright, so the user provided some debug information about their program and mentioned that the binary they're working with is a simple one that prints "hello\n". They also indicated that they've attached the binary but didn't include it in the message.

First, looking at the backtrace, I see that the program crashes during execution. The stack trace shows various system calls being made, like open and read, which suggests that maybe there's an issue with file handling or input/output operations. 

The key point is to figure out why a simple "hello" print would cause such behavior. Since it's supposed to be basic, perhaps there's some environmental setup missing, like not setting up the standard output correctly. Maybe the binary expects certain environment variables or arguments that aren't provided when running standalone.

I should consider common pitfalls for binaries that fail at runtime despite being simple. One possibility is a missing dynamic linker, which would cause errors when trying to load shared libraries. Alternatively, there might be issues with the binary's dependencies not being found, leading to unexpected failures.

Another angle is static linking versus dynamic linking. If the binary was dynamically linked but isn't properly set up, it could crash during startup. Also, the presence of certain system calls in the backtrace might hint at a missing file descriptor setup or incorrect handling of file operations early on in the program's execution.

I should also think about whether the user is running this on a different environment than intended, such as a container or a VM where some libraries are missing. Alternatively, maybe there's a problem with how the binary was compiled or stripped, making it fail when run without necessary setup.

In summary, I need to guide the user through verifying their execution environment, checking dependencies, and possibly running the binary in a debugger to pinpoint exactly where it fails.

It seems like you're dealing with a program that crashes during execution. The stack trace indicates that there's an issue with system calls (`open`, `read`, etc.) being made before the program has properly set up its environment or file descriptors.

Given that the binary is supposed to be a simple one that prints "hello\n", it's possible that:

1. **The binary is missing some required setup** (e.g., proper initialization of standard input/output).
2. **There might be an issue with how the program was compiled or linked**.
3. **The binary could be relying on certain environment variables or shared libraries that aren't properly set up**.

Since I don't have access to the actual binary, here's what I recommend:

1. **Run the binary in a debugger (e.g., GDB)**:
   ```bash
   gdb ./basic
   ```
   Then run `run` and see where it crashes. The backtrace should give you more precise information about where things are going wrong.

2. **Check if the binary has any dependencies**:
   Use `ldd ./basic` to see if all required shared libraries are present and properly linked.

3. **Verify that the binary is not stripped**:
   If the binary was compiled without debug symbols, it might be harder to analyze. Try rebuilding with debugging enabled (`-g` flag).

4. **Ensure proper file descriptors**:
   Make sure that `stdout`, `stderr`, etc., are properly set up if you're redirecting them or using any custom I/O setup.

If you provide the actual binary or more details about how it's crashing, I can help further!
