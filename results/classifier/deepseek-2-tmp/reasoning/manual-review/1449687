Alright, let's break down the bug report and figure out which category it falls into. The user mentioned that block migration of qcow2 VMs copies all empty space, leading to larger images than expected. They're using openstack icehouse with qemu-system-x86 2.0.0.

First, I need to recall what each category means. "block" typically refers to storage or disk operations in QEMU/KVM. The issue here is about how data is migrated during VM movement. Since the problem is related to copying empty space and the way qcow2 images handle sparse files or copy-on-write, it's definitely a storage-related bug.

Looking at the possible categories: device might be for hardware devices, network relates to networking issues, but this is more about disk blocks. The 'block' category makes sense here because it involves how data is being transferred from one storage medium (source) to another during migration.

I should also consider if any other category fits better. Mistranslation or assembly lowering don't seem relevant here. It's not a performance issue per se, but rather an incorrect handling of data blocks. So 'block' seems the most accurate.
