Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why my QEMU VM is getting stuck when I use the rrsnapshot option or try to load a previous state using loadvm. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the initial setup, I see that when I run the VM without any issues, it works fine. But when I add the rrsnapshot=init option, it freezes. Also, trying to load a snapshot via telnet or using GDB with reverse commands causes the same issue.

The error message mentions something about TCG not supporting a CPU feature related to RCU. Hmm, I remember that TCG is QEMU's translation engine for x86 on non-x86 hosts. Maybe there's an incompatibility here when running certain features like RCU with TCG.

I also noticed the warning about the CPUID feature tsc-deadline not being supported by TCG. Could this be causing the issue? If QEMU isn't properly handling that, it might lead to hangs or freezes during the snapshot replay.

I should check if RCU is involved in the snapshot loading process. Looking at the code snippet from rcu.c, there's a line where it waits on an event: qemu_event_wait(&rcu_call_ready_event). If this event never gets triggered, the thread would hang indefinitely.

Maybe when using rrsnapshot or loadvm, QEMU expects some specific state that isn't being properly handled by TCG. Since TCG might not emulate certain CPU features accurately, it's causing RCU to wait forever for an event that never comes.

Another thought: perhaps I'm running this on a non-x86 host, but using a KVM that requires hardware acceleration. But in my case, the build is x86_64-softmmu, which uses TCG, so maybe there are known issues with RCU and TCG performance or support.

I should also consider if I'm using the latest QEMU version. The user mentioned building from 9.1.0. Maybe this issue has been fixed in a later release. Checking the QEMU bug tracker might help see if others have encountered similar problems.

Additionally, perhaps there's an issue with how the snapshot is being handled. If the snapshot includes state that relies heavily on RCU or other features not supported by TCG, it could cause the VM to hang.

So, possible solutions:
1. Try using a newer QEMU version where this might be fixed.
2. Switch to KVM if possible for better hardware acceleration, which might handle these events correctly.
3. Check if any patches exist for this specific warning and RCU issue when using TCG.

I think the main problem is that TCG can't fully emulate all CPU features needed for proper RCU functionality, leading to hangs during snapshot replay or state loading. Upgrading QEMU or changing the emulation method might resolve it.

The issue arises because QEMU's TCG engine doesn't fully support certain CPU features required by RCU, causing the VM to hang when using rrsnapshot or loadvm commands. To resolve this:

1. **Upgrade QEMU**: Update to a newer version where this issue might have been fixed.

2. **Use KVM Instead of TCG**: If possible, switch to KVM for better hardware acceleration and proper handling of RCU events.

3. **Check for Patches**: Review the QEMU bug tracker for any patches addressing RCU issues with TCG.

**Answer:**

The problem occurs because QEMU's TCG engine lacks support for certain CPU features needed by RCU, causing hangs during snapshot operations. To fix it:

1. Upgrade to a newer QEMU version.
2. Use KVM instead of TCG if available.
3. Look for patches addressing this issue.

**Final Answer:**
The VM freezes due to TCG's inability to handle specific CPU features required by RCU. Upgrading QEMU or switching to KVM may resolve the issue.
