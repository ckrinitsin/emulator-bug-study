Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why our virtual machines (VMs) are experiencing this clock-related issue where they seem stuck reading the clock constantly after migration. This has happened before on newer Gold CPUs, but now it's also occurring on older Intel E5 processors. We tried migrating them for three days between kernel versions 4.14.63 and 4.19.43 without success, so something must be different this time.

Looking at the stack trace provided, it seems like the VMs are in a state where they're frequently calling functions related to reading the clock: `pvclock_clocksource_read`, `kvm_clock_read`, `timekeeping_get_ns`, and others. This suggests that the VM's timing mechanism is not functioning correctly post-migration.

I remember from previous experience that when a VM migrates between physical hosts, several things can go wrong with time synchronization. The clock in the VM might get out of sync if the host clocks aren't properly synchronized, or there could be issues with how the hypervisor (like KVM) handles the clock after migration.

First, I should consider whether the host systems have NTP correctly configured and are synchronized. If the hosts themselves have incorrect time, the VMs will inherit that wrong time, leading to potential issues. Also, we might need to check if the `pvclock` (the paravirtualized clock) is being handled properly by KVM on both source and destination hosts.

Another angle is looking into how the migration process itself handles the transfer of the VM's state, particularly the virtual CPU's (vCPU) state. There could be a bug in the way the vCPUs are saved and restored during migration that causes their timing to reset or get stuck.

I should also examine the specific kernel versions we're using. The issue occurred on both older and newer kernels, but perhaps there's a regression between 4.14.63 and 4.19.43 that affects how clock sources are managed in KVM environments. Maybe certain patches or changes in those kernels introduced this problem.

Since the VMs are running Linux kernels (3.*), we might need to look into how their timekeeping mechanisms interact with the hypervisor's. Perhaps there's a miscommunication between the guest OS and the host regarding the clocksource after migration, causing the VM to repeatedly adjust or read the clock.

To debug this, I can try the following steps:

1. **Check Host Time Synchronization**: Ensure that all source and destination hosts have NTP properly configured and are synchronized with an external time server. Misconfigured NTP could cause discrepancies in the VM's clock after migration.

2. **Inspect Migration Logs**: Look into the logs from the migration process on both the source and destination hosts for any errors or warnings related to timing, clock adjustment, or vCPU state issues.

3. **Analyze KVM Configuration**: Review how KVM is configured on both hosts. Are there specific settings related to clock sources (like `clock=`) that might be causing problems? Maybe switching between different clock types could help.

4. **Check for Kernel Patches**: Look up if there are any patches or known issues in the KVM or kernel versions we're using regarding clock synchronization after migration. There might be existing bug reports or fixes we can apply.

5. **Use Debugging Tools**: Utilize tools like `systemtap` or `perf` to trace the VM's behavior during and after migration, focusing on time-related functions and vCPU activity.

6. **Reproduce the Issue**: If possible, set up a controlled environment where I can trigger the issue again under different conditions (e.g., with specific load patterns or timing configurations) to isolate when it occurs.

7. **Examine VM Clock Mechanisms**: In the guest OS kernels, check how they handle time changes and synchronization after migration. Maybe there's an issue in how the guest detects a change in the host's clock source.

8. **Look into vCPU State Handling**: Investigate if the way vCPUs are saved and restored during migration is correct. Perhaps some state related to timing (like pending interrupts or clock adjustments) isn't being handled properly, causing the VM to loop in reading the clock.

9. **Update Kernels and Hypervisors**: If there are newer versions of KVM or the Linux kernel available, consider updating them to see if the issue persists. There might have been fixes for similar bugs.

10. **Consult Community and Bug Forums**: Check forums like the KVM mailing list, Red Hat bugzilla, or other community resources where others might have encountered and resolved similar issues.

By systematically going through these steps, I can narrow down the possible causes of the VMs getting stuck reading the clock after migration. It's a complex issue involving both host and guest systems, as well as the hypervisor's handling of state during migration.

To address the issue where VMs get stuck reading the clock after migration, we'll systematically investigate and implement solutions based on potential causes:

1. **Host Time Synchronization**: Ensure all hosts have NTP correctly configured. Use tools like `ntpq` to check synchronization status and adjust configurations if necessary.

2. **Migration Logs Analysis**: Review logs from both source and destination hosts for any migration-related errors, focusing on timing issues or vCPU state changes.

3. **KVM Configuration Check**: Examine KVM settings, especially clock sources (`clock=`). Consider switching between different clock types (e.g., `rtctime` vs. `hyperv`) to test stability.

4. **Kernel Patch Review**: Investigate if existing patches address clock synchronization issues in the used kernel versions. Apply any relevant fixes or updates.

5. **Debugging with Tools**: Use systemtap or perf to trace time-related functions and vCPU activity during migration, identifying patterns that correlate with the issue.

6. **Reproduction Setup**: Replicate the environment to isolate conditions causing the problem, testing under various load and timing scenarios.

7. **VM Clock Mechanisms**: In guest OS kernels, check how time changes are handled post-migration. Ensure proper detection of host clock source changes.

8. **vCPU State Handling**: Review KVM's vCPU save/restore processes for any missing or incorrectly restored timing states causing loops in clock reading.

9. **Update Kernels/Hypervisors**: Upgrade to newer kernel versions if available, to benefit from potential bug fixes related to migration and timekeeping.

10. **Community Resources**: Engage with forums and bug repositories to find existing solutions or gather insights from similar issues.

By methodically addressing each area, we can identify the root cause of the clock-related issue in VMs after migration and implement effective fixes.
