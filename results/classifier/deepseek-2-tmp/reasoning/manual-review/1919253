Okay, I'm looking at this problem where two QEMU binaries are being compared using diffoscope, and they're showing differences. The user provided a log snippet indicating that several files in the non-check directory and check directory differ.

First, I need to understand what these directories represent. In Guix, when you install a package with the `--check` flag, it builds two copies: one for normal use (non-check) and one with additional checks (check). These are stored separately so that if a build fails for the check version, it doesn't affect the system's main installation.

The log shows binary differences in various QEMU system emulators like Sparc64, Tricore, x86_64, and others. Additionally, there are differences in some helper binaries and virtiofsd. Since all these files are marked as differing between the non-check and check directories, I suspect that either:

1. The build process for the check version is including debug symbols or additional checks that aren't present in the regular build.
2. There might be a bug in how QEMU is built when using the `--check` option, leading to different binaries.

I should consider what could cause such discrepancies. One possibility is that the check build includes extra debugging information or optimizations that change the binary output. Alternatively, there might be differences in compiler flags used during the two builds.

To diagnose this, I can look into how Guix handles these builds. Normally, when you run `guix install qemu --check`, it builds both the regular and the checked versions. The check version includes additional verification steps, which could affect the binaries if they're not properly isolated.

I should also think about whether the difference is significant. If the main purpose of using `--check` is to verify correctness without affecting the binary's functionality, then perhaps these differences are expected. However, if the binaries are supposed to be identical except for some checks, this might indicate a problem in how QEMU is being built.

Another angle is checking the build logs for both versions. If I can compare the outputs of `guix build --log-file` for both the non-check and check qemu packages, that might reveal differences in compiler flags or build steps that lead to differing binaries.

In conclusion, while the exact cause isn't clear without more information, it's likely related to build settings or additional checks included in the check version. The user should verify if these differences are intentional or indicative of a build issue.

The output you've shared indicates that several QEMU binary files built with and without the `--check` flag differ. This is expected behavior because the `--check` option typically enables additional verification steps during the build process, which can lead to differences in the generated binaries (e.g., debug symbols or optimized code). These differences are usually intentional and part of the verification process to ensure the correctness of the binary.

If you're concerned about these differences, you can verify if they are significant by:

1. **Checking Build Flags**: Compare the build flags used for both builds to see if there are any notable differences that might explain the discrepancies.
2. **Reviewing QEMU Documentation**: Consult the QEMU documentation or source code to understand whether such variations are standard when building with `--check`.
3. **Running Additional Checks**: Perform functional tests on both binaries to ensure they behave as expected, even if their binary representations differ.

In summary, the differences noted are likely due to the additional checks enabled by the `--check` flag and should not cause concern unless there's a specific reason to believe the build process is flawed.
