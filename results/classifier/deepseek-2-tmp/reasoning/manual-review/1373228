Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where the user is having issues with their USB devices on a system that's using xhci_hcd. The logs show two messages about resetting a high-speed USB device number 8 and then some errors about dropping endpoints because they're disabled.

First, I'll try to understand what these log entries mean. The "reset" message indicates that the system is attempting to reset the USB device, which often happens when there's an issue with communication or the device isn't responding properly. Then, the subsequent lines mention xhci_drop_endpoint being called with a disabled endpoint. This suggests that the xHCI (USB 3.0) host controller is trying to drop some endpoints because they're in a disabled state.

Looking at the lspci -nn output provided, I see that the USB controller is an Intel Corporation 8 Series USB xHCI HC. The device ID is [8086:9c31], which corresponds to known USB controllers from Intel. So it's using the xhci_hcd driver, which is standard for USB 3.0 support.

Now, thinking about possible causes of these issues, a few things come to mind:

1. **Hardware Issues**: The USB device itself might be faulty or not properly seated in the port. Maybe there's some physical damage or a loose connection.
2. **Driver Problems**: There could be issues with the xhci_hcd driver itself, either due to a bug or incorrect configuration. Sometimes drivers need updates or reconfiguration.
3. **Firmware Issues**: The firmware on the USB controller might be outdated or corrupted, causing communication problems with certain devices.
4. **Power Management**: If the system is in a low-power state, it might be cutting power to certain USB ports, leading to devices being disabled and needing resets.
5. **Kernel Logs**: The specific error messages about dropping endpoints because they're disabled could indicate that the kernel isn't handling the device correctly or there's a race condition during bus enumeration.

The user mentioned they tried resetting the device, which is a common troubleshooting step for USB issues. However, since the problem persists, more in-depth troubleshooting is necessary.

I should ask the user for additional information to better diagnose this issue. Here are some questions I would have:

- Are all USB devices affected, or only specific ones?
- Have there been any recent changes like driver updates, kernel upgrades, or hardware additions/removals?
- What type of device is number 8? Is it a particular make and model that might be problematic with this USB controller?
- Does the issue occur consistently when using certain peripherals, such as external drives, mice, or keyboards?
- Have they checked if the problem occurs under different operating systems (if dual-booting)?
- Are there any other kernel warnings/errors around the time of these logs?

Additionally, I might suggest some troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Device Status**: Use lsusb or dmesg to see if the device is recognized correctly and if there are any additional error messages.
2. **Update Drivers**: Ensure that all drivers, especially xhci_hcd, are up to date with the latest kernel version.
3. **Firmware Update**: Check for BIOS/UEFI updates from the motherboard manufacturer, as they often include firmware fixes for USB controllers.
4. **Power Cycle**: Sometimes, a full power cycle (remove and reinsert the USB device or even rebooting the system) can resolve temporary issues.
5. **Test with Other Devices**: Try connecting other USB devices to see if the problem is isolated to one device or multiple.
6. **Check for Overcurrent**: If using a USB hub, ensure it's not drawing too much power, causing the controller to reset.

By gathering more information and following these steps, we can narrow down whether the issue lies with hardware, drivers, firmware, or another factor.

To address the USB issues you're experiencing, here are some organized steps and considerations:

### Understanding the Problem:
- **Logs Analysis**: The logs indicate a reset attempt on device number 8 and errors about dropping endpoints due to them being disabled. This points towards communication issues between the USB controller and the device.
- **USB Controller**: The Intel 8 Series USB xHCI HC is known for its reliability, but driver or firmware issues can still cause problems.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Hardware Issues**: Check if the USB port or device is faulty or loose.
2. **Driver Problems**: Outdated or incorrect drivers might be causing instability.
3. **Firmware Issues**: Corrupted or outdated firmware on the controller could lead to communication failures.
4. **Power Management**: Power-saving modes might disable ports, causing resets.
5. **Kernel Issues**: The kernel might have problems handling the device, possibly due to race conditions.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. **Identify Affected Devices**: Determine if all USB devices are affected or just specific ones.
2. **Check Recent Changes**: Look for any recent updates or hardware changes that could impact USB functionality.
3. **Device-Specific Issues**: Identify the device (make and model) to check for known compatibility issues.
4. **Power Cycle**: Reboot the system or remove/reinsert the USB device to see if it resolves temporarily.
5. **Update Drivers/Firmware**: Ensure all drivers, especially xhci_hcd, are up-to-date. Check for BIOS/UEFI updates.

### Additional Information Needed:
- Are other USB devices affected?
- Have there been recent OS changes or driver updates?
- What specific device is number 8 (make/model)?
- Does the issue persist across different operating systems?

### Suggested Commands:
- **lsusb**: To list all recognized USB devices and check for device status.
- **dmesg | grep usb**: For more detailed kernel messages related to USB.

By following these steps and providing additional information, we can better diagnose and resolve the USB issues you're encountering.
