Alright, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. The user mentioned that QEMU 1.0.1 lacks support for certain widescreen resolutions under -vga std, specifically 1680x1050, 1600x1000, and 1440x900. They're using KVM and want to have native full screen mode on their laptops.

First, I'll look at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about missing video modes. Since it's related to VGA and widescreen resolutions, this falls under the graphics category. The user isn't reporting issues with translation or assembly; instead, they're pointing out that certain display modes aren't supported. Therefore, the most appropriate category here is 'graphic'.
