Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "PNG screendump has R/B channels swapped." The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the issue is about a PNG screenshot having incorrect color channelsâ€”specifically, red and blue being swapped. This sounds like an image processing problem, which falls under graphics handling.

Looking at the categories, "graphic" seems to fit because it's related to how images or graphics are rendered or captured. The other options don't quite match: it's not a translation issue, nor does it involve devices, sockets, network, etc.

So, the category is likely "graphic."
