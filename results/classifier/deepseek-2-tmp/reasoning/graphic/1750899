Okay, so I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. Let's go through it step by step.

The user is experiencing an issue with their mouse cursor in a virtual machine set up using QEMU. Specifically, the cursor sometimes can't pass an invisible border on the right side of the screen. They've been using QEMU for four years without issues, but after changing hardware and software (including monitors, GPU, Windows versions), they started having problems.

They mentioned that they're using GPU passthrough with Radeon RX580 and have set up two monitors in Eyefinity mode. The mouse is acting up, especially when moving near the right border. They tried different mouse emulations (standard PS/2, tablet, virtio-mouse-pci, etc.), but all resulted in similar issues. The only workaround was using a physical USB port with an additional mouse.

Looking at the command line they provided, it's clear they're using various QEMU options, including VirtIO devices and USB configuration.

Now, considering the categories: Mistranslation, Assembly, Other, Device, Graphic, Socket, Network, KVM, Boot, VNC, Debug, Files, Permissions, Performance, Kernel, Peripherals, Hypervisor.

The issue is related to mouse input in a GPU-passthrough setup. Since it's a display-related problem after changing monitors and GPU configuration, the graphics handling might be at fault. The fact that they're using Eyefinity (which deals with multiple displays) could mean that QEMU isn't correctly handling extended desktops or the coordinate system for mouse movement in such setups.

Other possibilities: It doesn't seem to relate directly to translation errors (mistranslation), assembly code, sockets, network, boot process, VNC, debug features, file handling, permissions, performance bottlenecks, kernel issues, or hypervisor functions. It also might not be a peripheral issue in the traditional sense since it's specifically about mouse input behavior within the VM.

The most fitting category seems to be 'graphic' because the problem arises with display configuration changes and affects how the mouse interacts with the screen layout.
