Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. So the user is talking about QEMU for Windows and an issue where the host window doesn't resize when the guest's screen size changes while moving the window.

First, I'll read through the problem again. The user mentioned that when the guest OS switches from a legacy text mode (80x25) to a VESA mode like 1024x768, the host window should adjust its size accordingly. But if the window is being moved during this switch, it doesn't resize as expected.

I know QEMU handles graphics through different options like -vga std, cirrus, etc., and the user tried several of them without success. The issue seems related to how the host window's dimensions are updated when the guest changes its video mode.

The possible categories include things like 'graphic', which I think is relevant here because it's about screen sizes and window resizing in the graphical display. Other options like 'network' or 'KVM' don't seem related since this is purely a graphical issue.

I should also consider if there are other possible categories, but none of them fit as well as 'graphic'. The problem isn't with network connections, hardware devices, permissions, or performance; it's specifically about the visual display not updating correctly when moved during a screen mode change.
