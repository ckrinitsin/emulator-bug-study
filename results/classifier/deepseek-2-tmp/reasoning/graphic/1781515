Alright, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the bug report, the user is using QEMU on Arch Linux to run an Arch Linux VM. The problem occurs when they change the resolution in the guest OS, leading to a corrupted screen. They mention that this happens with -vga std but works with -vga virtio.

The key points here are related to graphics and video drivers. The issue arises during the handling of display resolutions, which suggests it's tied to how QEMU manages the graphical output. Since VirtIO is a paravirtualization driver that provides better performance for I/O devices like graphics, network, etc., but the problem occurs with -vga std (the standard VGA support), this points towards a graphics-related issue in QEMU.

The categories provided include 'graphic', which seems to fit here because it's about display resolution and video drivers. Other options like 'device' or 'peripherals' are broader but don't specifically address the graphical aspect as directly as 'graphic'. 

I'm confident that 'graphic' is the correct category for this bug report.

The issue relates to screen corruption when adjusting the guest OS's resolution using QEMU with the standard VGA driver, suggesting a problem with the graphic handling.
