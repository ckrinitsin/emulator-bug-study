Okay, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is having trouble running the Quake demo in QEMU with resolutions above 640x480. They mention issues with loading the VESA palette in the DOS prompt and the game crashing. 

Looking at their setup, they tried different virtual video cards like Cirrus, std, and vmware. The problem seems to be specific to higher resolutions because 320x200 works fine. When using -vga cirrus or -vga std, setting 640x480 causes errors about loading the VESA palette. However, with VMware's svgaII, it works okay.

So, the issue is related to how QEMU handles video modes and VESA palettes in DOS environments. Since this involves the display settings and compatibility with certain graphics adapters, I'm thinking it's a problem with the VNC or the way QEMU emulates the graphics hardware.

Wait, but the user mentioned using different virtual video cards like Cirrus and VMware's svgaII. They had success with svgaII for higher resolutions but not with others. So maybe it's an issue with how QEMU's VNC driver handles certain resolutions or the VESA palette loading in DOS mode. Alternatively, it could be related to the graphics adapter emulation.

But the main problem seems to be specific to the video configuration and its interaction with DOS applications, which likely ties into the VNC or the graphics device support in QEMU. However, since they're using a DOS application, perhaps it's more about how the VESA palette is being handled during boot or within the guest OS.

Wait, but I'm supposed to pick from the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The problem is about video resolutions and VESA palette loading in a DOS environment within QEMU, which points to graphics-related issues. So the category would be 'graphic'. Alternatively, since it's related to the display settings during boot or when running DOS apps, maybe 'boot' or 'vnc', but I think 'graphic' is more appropriate because it's about video modes and hardware emulation.
