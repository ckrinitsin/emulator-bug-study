Okay, so I have to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through it again carefully.

The user mentions that "ctrl+alt+2 doesn't work on gtk display." They also note that the monitor console isn't appearing in GTK but works for SDL and VNC. Their GTK version is 3.12.2, and they're using QEMU 2.2.0.

Looking at the categories provided: graphic seems to be about display-related issues. Since the problem occurs specifically with GTK display and not others, it's likely a graphics issue within QEMU. The monitor console not showing up is also a visual aspect, so that points towards the 'graphic' category.
