Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user mentioned issues with Cirrus video and graphical corruption when using the `-vga cirrus` option in QEMU. They noticed garbled text during installation and similar problems with an old X server.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, etc. Since the issue is specifically about video and graphics, the most fitting category seems to be "graphic." It's related to how the Cirrus video emulation handles graphical output, leading to corruption.
