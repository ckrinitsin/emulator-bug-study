Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's look at what the report says. The user mentions that QEMU uses a bitmap icon (qemu-icon.bmp) which causes display artifacts because white pixels are treated as transparent. They suggest switching to a PNG with an alpha channel.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, and others like network, KVM, etc. The issue is about the display of an icon causing visual problems. Since this relates directly to how images or icons are rendered on the screen, it falls under the 'graphic' category.

The bug report discusses issues with how QEMU displays its icon, specifically mentioning bitmap artifacts and suggesting a switch to a different image format for better transparency handling. This is related to graphical display issues.

**Answer: graphic**
