Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is encountering an issue where they can't take a snapshot of their VM when using virtio-gpu as the graphics driver. They're getting an error from libvirt about a non-migratable device '0000:00:02.0/virtio-gpu'. 

So, I know that taking snapshots in QEMU/KVM involves live migration or some form of state capture. If a device is considered non-migratable, it means that the device's state can't be saved and restored properly during this process. The error specifically points to virtio-gpu as the problematic device.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, etc. Since virtio-gpu is a GPU-related device, but more specifically, it's part of the graphics drivers in QEMU/KVM. So the issue seems related to the graphics component. 

I remember that VirtIO devices are designed for efficient I/O virtualization, and virtio-gpu is one such device for GPU passthrough or acceleration. If this device isn't properly handled during migration/snapshotting, it falls under a graphics-related bug because it's tied directly to how the GPU is being managed in the VM.

So, considering all that, the category should be 'graphic'.
