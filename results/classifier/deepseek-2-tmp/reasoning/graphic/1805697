Alright, I'm trying to classify this bug report from QEMU. The user mentioned that when using the "egl-headless" display option, it crashes when changing resolution after login in XFCE. They tried versions 2.12, 3.0, and 3.1.0-rc2.

Looking at the error message: It's failing an assertion in egl_scanout_flush because the surface width doesn't match the guest FB's width. This seems related to how the display output is handled.

The possible categories include graphics-related options like 'graphic' or 'vnc'. Since the issue involves EGL and display handling, it likely falls under the 'graphic' category rather than other areas like network or KVM. The crash happens in the UI layer, so 'graphic' makes sense.
