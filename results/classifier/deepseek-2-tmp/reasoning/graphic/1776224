Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user is reporting an issue with QEMU's SPICE server where the LED state for caps lock isn't being updated correctly. They mention that when sending capslock keycodes, the server doesn't update its state, causing "funny behaviors" like the caps lock blinking in the guest. However, numlock works fine.

Looking at the provided logs, it seems that when SPICE sends certain keycodes (like 58 and 186 for capslock), QEMU processes them but doesn't trigger the LED state update as expected. In contrast, with numlock (keycode 69 and 197), the LED state is updated correctly.

The user suspects that the callback for LEDs isn't being called for capslock. They mention that SPICE registers a callback via qemu_add_led_event_handler but it's not invoked. This suggests an issue in how events are handled, possibly related to how keycodes or events are processed in QEMU.

Considering the categories:

- **graphic**: Since this relates to LED states which are part of the graphical interface (SPICE is used for remote desktop access), and the issue affects visual feedback (caps lock blinking), it seems relevant.
  
- Other categories like network, socket, or device might not be as fitting since the problem isn't with networking or hardware devices but rather with input handling and LED state updates.

Thus, the most appropriate category here is **graphic** because it's related to how SPICE handles graphical feedback for LEDs in the guest OS.
