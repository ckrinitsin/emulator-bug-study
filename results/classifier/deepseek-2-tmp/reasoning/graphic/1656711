Alright, I'm looking at this bug report about QEMU where the GTK3 interface doesn't zoom-to-fit by default. The user mentions that the SDL interface automatically scales, but GTK3 requires manually enabling "Zoom To Fit." They also note there's no command-line option to turn it on, making it harder to use.

So, I need to classify this under one of the provided categories. Let me go through them:

- Mistranslation: Not related; this is about UI behavior.
- Assembly lowering: No, that's more about code generation.
- Other: A possibility if none fit better.
- Device: Maybe, but it's about interface scaling, not hardware devices.
- Graphic: This seems relevant as it's about the graphical user interface and display scaling.
- Socket/network/kernel/peripherals/hypervisor/boot/vnc/debug/files/permissions/performance: None of these seem to fit.

The issue is specifically with how the GTK3 interface handles zooming, which directly relates to graphic display settings. Therefore, the appropriate category here should be "graphic."
