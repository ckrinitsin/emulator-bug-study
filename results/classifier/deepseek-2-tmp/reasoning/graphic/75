Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is asking about a specific feature request: adding an option called "-display SDL grab-on-hover" in QEMU. I need to determine which category this falls into from the given list.

First, looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. Since the mention is about "-display SDL", it seems related to how QEMU handles display output. SDL stands for Simple DirectMedia Layer, which is a library used for handling multimedia in applications, commonly used for graphics and input.

So, this is likely about the graphical interface or display settings within QEMU. The option "grab-on-hover" suggests that when you hover over the window, it grabs the mouse pointer, which is a feature related to how the display handles user input, specifically mouse events.

Looking at the categories again, "graphic" seems like the most fitting because it's about the visual output and mouse interaction in the graphical interface. None of the other categories like network or kernel seem relevant here since they don't pertain to display settings.

Therefore, the classification should be under "graphic."
