Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "Cursor jumps on shape change with vmware vga". Let me break it down.

The user mentioned it's part of QEMU, so I'm thinking about the possible categories. The options include things like mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, etc. 

The key points here are the cursor jumping and VMware VGA. Cursor movement issues often relate to how input is handled, especially in graphical environments. Since it's related to the VGA display under VMware, which is a hypervisor provider, but the issue seems more about graphics rather than the hypervisor itself.

So, "graphic" seems like the most fitting category because it involves cursor behavior on the screen, which is a graphical interface aspect.

The bug report mentions issues with the cursor jumping when there's a change in shape, specifically with VMware VGA. This points to a problem related to how the cursor behaves graphically under certain conditions, likely within the virtual machine's display handling.
