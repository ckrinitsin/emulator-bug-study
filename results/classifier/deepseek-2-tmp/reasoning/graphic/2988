Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the description carefully.

The issue is about the absolute mouse mode being broken in SDL2. The user mentions that relative mouse mode hasn't worked correctly either, especially when dealing with stretched displays and cursor data warped by the HOST UI backend. They reference a specific commit (30aa1056...) which tried to fix this but didn't work out. Additionally, absolute mouse mode was working before this commit but broke afterward without any fixes.

Looking at the possible categories: assembly, device, graphic, network, etc. The problem revolves around the mouse input handling in SDL2, which is part of the graphical display system.	SDL2 is used for rendering graphics and handling user inputs like mouse events. Since the issue pertains to how mouse modes are handled in the display context, it's likely related to the graphics subsystem.

Therefore, the appropriate category here would be "graphic".
