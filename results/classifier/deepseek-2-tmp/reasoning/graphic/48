Alright, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The issue mentioned is about the hover effect color for the "Full list of releases" button having low contrast. Hmm, that sounds like a UI-related problem because it's talking about colors and visibility on the interface.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, etc. I'm thinking this has to do with graphics or display issues. The hover effect is part of the graphical user interface, so "graphic" seems like the right category.

Other options don't fit as well. It's not about performance, network, or kernel stuff. No, it's specifically about how something looks on the screen, which points directly to the graphic category.
