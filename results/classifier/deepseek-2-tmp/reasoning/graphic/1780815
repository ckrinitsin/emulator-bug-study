Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The issue is about SDL not rescaling the image when the guest's resolution changes in fullscreen mode. 

First, let me read the problem again. When the guest OS changes its resolution, say from 640x480 to 1024x768, the display doesn't update properly. The user ends up seeing only a part of the screen, which is stretched. Manually exiting and re-entering fullscreen fixes it temporarily.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem seems related to how the display is handled. Since SDL is involved, which is a library for creating graphical windows and handling events, this likely falls under graphics or display issues. 

I'm considering 'graphic' as the primary category here because it's about how the image is rendered on the screen. The issue isn't with translation between architectures (mistranslation), nor is it related to assembly code (assembly). It doesn't fit into other categories like network, socket, or hypervisor either.

So, I think 'graphic' is the most appropriate category because it's about display scaling and window management.
