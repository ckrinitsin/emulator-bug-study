Alright, so I need to figure out the category for this bug report. The user is having trouble booting a Windows 7 installation DVD in QEMU 2.6.0/OVMF. They provided details about how it works with version 2.5.50 but fails in 2.6.0.

Looking at their commands, they're using various options like -vga cirrus and others. The problem occurs when trying to boot the installation media, and the system hangs or freezes at different points depending on the VGA option used.

The categories provided include things like mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, etc. Since the issue is related to the display behavior during boot—specifically with different VGA options—the problem likely lies in how QEMU handles graphics or display output when using OVMF and certain VGA drivers.

I think "graphic" would be the most appropriate category here because it's directly affecting the visual output and boot process, which relates to the graphics hardware emulation.
