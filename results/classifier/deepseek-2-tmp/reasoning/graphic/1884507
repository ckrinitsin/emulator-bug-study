Okay, so I need to classify this bug report in QEMU into one of the given categories. The possible categories are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the bug report: the user is saying that when using '-M none', which I know refers to a machine type in QEMU without any peripherals except CPU cores. They mention it's pointless to start a display and suggest that '-M none' should imply '-display none'.

Hmm, so the issue here is about how the machine type interacts with the display option. The 'none' machine doesn't have a display, so forcing the display to be off makes sense.

Looking at the categories, 'graphic' seems related because it's about the display or graphical interface. The problem is that without specifying '-display none', QEMU might try to start a display even when it's unnecessary for the 'none' machine, which could lead to errors or inefficiencies.

Other possible categories: device? Well, maybe, but devices usually refer to hardware peripherals. Since this is about the display, which is more of a graphical output, 'graphic' fits better. So I think the category here is 'graphic'.
