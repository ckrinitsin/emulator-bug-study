Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. The user provided a list of possible categories like mistranslation, assembly lowering, and others such as device, graphic, etc.

The bug report says: "Optionally do not clear the screen when starting a VM." So the issue is about what happens to the console or display when a virtual machine starts. Specifically, it's about whether the screen is cleared or not upon VM startup.

Looking at the categories, I should think about which one fits best. The bug isn't related to code translation (so not mistranslation), nor does it seem to be an assembly lowering issue. It doesn't fall under performance, kernel, or hypervisor either.

This seems more like a display-related issue because it's about the screen being cleared, which would affect how the VM appears on the user's monitor. The 'graphic' category makes sense here since it pertains to graphical output handling during VM startup.

The bug report concerns the behavior of the QEMU emulator when starting a virtual machine (VM), specifically whether the screen is cleared or not. This relates to the graphical output of the emulator, which falls under the 'graphic' category.

Answer: graphic
