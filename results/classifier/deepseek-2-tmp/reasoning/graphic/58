Alright, I'm trying to classify this bug report: "Bitmaps with Extra Data cannot be removed." The possible categories are quite specific, so I need to figure out which one fits best.

First, I know that QEMU is a versatile emulator and hypervisor. So the issue might relate to how it handles bitmap data, possibly in graphics or display contexts because bitmaps are often used there.

The bug mentions "Bitmaps with Extra Data." That sounds like it's related to how images or displays are handled. Maybe when extra data is attached to a bitmap, QEMU can't remove them properly. This could affect the graphical output or cause issues when trying to manage resources.

Looking at the categories, "graphic" seems relevant because bitmaps are part of graphics handling in emulators. Other possibilities like "files" or "permissions" don't seem as fitting because the issue is more about data handling rather than file operations or access rights.

I also considered if it might relate to device management since devices can involve hardware emulation, but bitmaps are more directly tied to graphical rendering. So, I think "graphic" is the most appropriate category here.

The bug report relates to an issue with handling bitmaps in QEMU, specifically when extra data is attached and cannot be removed, which affects graphical operations.
