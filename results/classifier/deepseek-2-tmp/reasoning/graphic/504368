Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the provided categories. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The user reported that the SDL window for a VM intermittently scales instead of resizing. They mention that they can't find any pattern and prefer the window to resize normally without scaling. The issue seems related to how the display is handled, possibly in graphics rendering or window management within QEMU-KVM.

Looking at the possible categories: graphic, network, socket, etc., I think "graphic" fits here because it's about the display behavior of the virtual machine. The problem isn't with performance, permissions, or device drivers specificallyâ€”it's more about how the window scales versus resizing. 

I should consider if there are other relevant categories. It doesn't seem to relate to network issues since that's about connectivity, nor does it involve sockets or hypervisor management directly. The issue is more visual and display-related, which points towards "graphic."

So, after evaluating, I'm confident the correct category for this bug report is graphic.
