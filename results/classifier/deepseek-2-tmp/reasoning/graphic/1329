Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the description carefully.

The user is reporting an issue where changing the color scheme in CDE doesn't update the screen everywhere at once. Instead, it only updates areas where the mouse pointer moves over, and even then, it seems to update the whole width of the screen as the mouse moves. They provided a link to a screen capture which probably shows this behavior.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem is about the screen not updating correctly after changing the color scheme. This sounds related to how the display or graphics are being handled. The fact that moving the mouse causes parts of the screen to update suggests it's an issue with rendering or windowing systems.

In QEMU, graphic-related bugs often involve issues with the graphical interface, like display updates not happening as expected. Since this is about screen updates and visual changes only appearing when the mouse moves over them, it likely falls under the 'graphic' category.

I don't see any mention of network, sockets, or other areas. It's specifically about the visual elements responding to mouse movement, which points to a graphics issue within QEMU.

The bug is related to screen updates and graphical display behavior in response to mouse movements, indicating an issue with the graphical interface handling.
