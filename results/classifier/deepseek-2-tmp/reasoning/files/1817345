Alright, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue described is that when the source directory path contains white spaces, the configure script breaks. Specifically, running `./configure --help` doesn't generate the target list correctly because of this whitespace in the path.

Looking at the possible categories, the bug seems to be related to how QEMU handles paths with spaces during configuration. This isn't directly about translation from source architecture or assembly lowering. It's more about handling directory paths correctly, which falls under file system operations.

The error occurs in the configure script, which is part of the build setup and not related to user-mode issues like mistranslation. It also doesn't involve device drivers, graphics, sockets, or network configurations. Similarly, it's unrelated to virtualization features like KVM, boot processes, VNC, debugging, performance tuning, kernel modules, peripherals, or hypervisors.

The problem is more about how variables are handled in the script, particularly `$mak_wilds` using spaces instead of newlines, which could be part of file handling. This points towards an issue with how QEMU's configure script processes paths, which falls under 'files' since it's dealing with directory names and their handling during setup.

Therefore, the appropriate category for this bug report is 'files'.

The bug report involves issues when the source path contains spaces, affecting the configure script's behavior. This relates to how QEMU handles file paths during configuration, making the category 'files' the most fitting.

Answer: files
