Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. The bug is about converting plain text files in the docs directory to restructured text (rst) format.

Looking at the list of possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is related to documentation files. The problem isn't about translating between architectures, so not 'mistranslation'. It's also not an assembly or any of the other listed categories like device or network. It doesn't pertain to KVM, booting, VNC, etc., either.

Since it's about handling and converting files in the documentation directory, it relates more to file management. The category 'files' seems appropriate because it's dealing with how files are handled within QEMU, specifically their format conversion for documentation purposes.

The bug report concerns file format conversion of plain text files in the documentation directory, which falls under file handling.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Bug Nature:** The issue is about converting documentation files from plain text to RST format.
2. **Review Categories:** Check if it fits into categories like 'files' or 'other'.
3. **Determine Fit:** Since it's about file conversion, 'files' category is the best fit.

**Answer:**
files
