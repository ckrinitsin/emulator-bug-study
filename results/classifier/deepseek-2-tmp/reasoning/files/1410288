Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user reported that when converting a blank image to qcow2 with qemu-img, it hangs if the image is less than 100kiB in size. They provided steps to reproduce and included strace output showing a loop of seeks.

Looking at the commands, they used 'truncate' to create a file of specific size (102399 bytes) and then ran 'qemu-img convert'. The strace shows repeated ioctl calls for FIEMAP and _llseek operations, indicating an infinite loop in seeking to the end of the file.

The issue is with qemu-img converting small blank images. Since it's related to file handling and specifically seeking, I should consider the categories provided. 

Possible categories include 'files', which relates to file operations, and 'performance' if there's a hang due to inefficiency, but here it's more about incorrect behavior leading to a loop.

The problem is in how QEMU handles small files during conversion. Since it involves file operations like seeking and mapping, the most appropriate category seems to be 'files'.
