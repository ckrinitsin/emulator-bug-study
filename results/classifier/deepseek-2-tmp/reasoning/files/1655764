Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through the problem again.

The user is using qemu-img convert with the -c compression option to compress a qcow2 image. They mention that when libvirt mounts the compressed image, it doesn't work properly. Also, decompression isn't working either, and they tried using glib-deflate for this purpose.

Hmm, looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue here seems to be related to image compression and decompression during the conversion process with qemu-img. Qemu-img is part of the qemu project, and in this case, it's about handling images correctly after compression. The problem isn't directly about translation between architectures or assembly lowering, so mistranslation and assembly don't fit.

It also doesn't seem to be related to network, socket, graphic, or other hardware-related areas like peripherals or devices. KVM is a hypervisor technology, but the issue here is more about image processing rather than virtual machine management.

The user tried decompressing with glib-deflate without success, which suggests that the problem is specifically with how qemu handles compressed images during conversion and mount operations. Since this relates to file handling, perhaps 'files' would be appropriate. Alternatively, it could also relate to permissions if there's an issue accessing files after compression.

But considering the primary action is using qemu-img convert for compression and decompression issues, I think 'files' makes sense because it's about how QEMU handles image files during these operations.
