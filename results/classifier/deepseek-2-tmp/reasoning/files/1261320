Alright, so I've got this bug report from Chris about QEMU and virtual disks larger than 16TB. Let me try to figure out which category this falls into.

First, the user mentions that when their disk file reaches 16TB, it becomes read-only. They're asking if there's an option to create a disk using multiple files instead of one big file. Their goal is to have a VM with a 22TB disk.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue seems related to how QEMU handles large virtual disks. The problem is that a single file can't exceed 16TB, and when it does, the disk becomes read-only. So, they're seeking a way to use multiple files instead of one. This sounds like an issue with how QEMU manages storage or files.

I don't think it's a translation issue because mistranslation relates to incorrect mappings in user-mode assembly. Similarly, assembly lowering is about optimizing code for the target architecture, which doesn't seem relevant here.

The bug isn't related to graphics, networking, sockets, booting, VNC, debugging, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, or hypervisor directly. It's more about storage management and file handling within QEMU.

So, the category that fits best is 'files' because it's about how QEMU handles disk files and their size limitations. They're trying to create a larger disk using multiple files, which ties into file management in the system.
