Alright, so I'm trying to classify this bug report about QEMU. The user is reporting that when using 'qemu-img snapshot', they can create a new snapshot with the same name as an existing one. They feel like this might be incorrect behavior because it allows duplicate names, which could lead to confusion or unexpected issues.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and other. 

The bug is related to the 'qemu-img' tool's snapshot functionality. The issue is about allowing duplicate snapshot names, which seems like it's an oversight in how snapshots are managed. It doesn't directly relate to translation issues or assembly lowering. Since it's not a hardware device problem but rather a feature of QEMU's disk image management, the category might be 'files' because it deals with file operations and naming conflicts.

Alternatively, since the issue is about enforcing unique names, which relates more to how the filesystem handles files and their metadata, 'files' seems appropriate. I don't think it falls under hypervisor or KVM because those are broader categories related to virtualization management.

The bug report deals with allowing duplicate snapshot names in QEMU's `qemu-img`, which is a file management issue within the tool. The category that best fits this is:

files
