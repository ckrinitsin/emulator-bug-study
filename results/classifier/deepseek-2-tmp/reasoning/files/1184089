Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The user is talking about a missing feature in QEMU: the ability to load a live snapshot as read-only. They want to load a snapshot and have all future changes redirected to a temporary file, making the original snapshot read-only. This would prevent any corruption of the image when restarting or modifying it. 

They mention that there were previous discussions and patches submitted by Eddie Kohler but nothing came out of it. The links provided seem to be old mailing list threads discussing this feature.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and other.

The main issue here is about snapshots and how they're loaded. Snapshots in QEMU are part of the file management system; when you take a snapshot, it's stored as a set of files. The ability to load a snapshot read-only would involve handling these files correctly without allowing writes to them. So this seems related to how files are managed during VM operations.

Another angle is that loading a snapshot might involve using specific switches like -loadvm and -snapshot, which are command-line options for QEMU. This affects the way the virtual machine starts and interacts with the disk images or snapshots.

Considering the categories, "files" seems appropriate because it's about how files (snapshots) are handled during runtime. Alternatively, maybe "other," but since it's a feature request related to file management, "files" fits better.

The bug report discusses the inability to load a snapshot as read-only, which affects how QEMU handles snapshots stored in files. This is directly related to file management and access modes.
