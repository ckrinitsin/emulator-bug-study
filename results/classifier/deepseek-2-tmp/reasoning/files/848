Okay, so I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user provided an error message where checkinstall is failing with a FileNotFoundError when trying to install some files during the build process.

Looking at the categories given: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The error occurs in the installation phase, specifically when using checkinstall. The traceback points to a problem in the meson build system's minstall.py file during the do_copyfile function. It seems that shutil.copystat is raising a FileNotFoundError because it can't find the source file.

Since the issue is happening during the file copying process, which is part of the installation steps and not directly related to translating code or assembly lowering, mistranslation or assembly categories don't fit here.

The error might be due to missing files in the build directory or incorrect paths. Alternatively, it could be a permissions issue, but the user mentioned that all required packages are installed and 'utime' is available from 'atfs'. 

Looking at the categories again, 'files' seems appropriate because the problem is about file operations during installation.

The bug occurs during file copying in the build process, so it's related to files.

**files**
