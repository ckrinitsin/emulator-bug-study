Okay, so I'm looking at this bug report about QEMU on macOS needing an embedded plist file. The user is saying that QEMU binaries should have this embedded property list because it's important for macOS applications, even command-line tools. They mention that things like the bundle identifier and other settings are usually set through Info.plist files inside the .app bundle.

They also explain that embedding the plist can be done by modifying the linker during compilation. The example they give is using a command line flag to create a section in the binary that includes the plist file. This would help with things like setting app-specific settings and even features like sudden termination handling without needing extra code, as mentioned in another issue #334.

Now, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the problem, it's about how QEMU binaries are built on macOS. Specifically, they're missing an embedded Info.plist, which is a necessary part of macOS applications for metadata and settings. The issue isn't related to translation between architectures (so not mistranslation), nor does it involve assembly code or performance issues. It's more about build configuration and ensuring that the binary includes required metadata.

The bug report suggests modifying the linker flags during compilation, which is a build-time change. This doesn't fall under categories like network, graphic, or kernel. Instead, it's about the structure of the binary file itself. Since the categories don't have a direct match for build settings or embedded files, the closest category would be 'files' as it pertains to how the binary includes necessary metadata in its file structure.

Alternatively, considering that this is related to build process and packaging, another thought might be 'other', but since 'files' is more specific to the content of the file, I think 'files' is a better fit.
