Alright, let's break down this bug report to figure out the correct classification. The user is talking about adding support for Virtio 9P filesystem passthrough with GlusterFS in QEMU. They mention that they can already add block devices using native libgfapi since QEMU 1.3 but want the same for filesystems.

So, the main issue here is about filesystem support, specifically with Virtio 9P. The user points out that without root privileges or xattr support, they can't passthrough userids and gids, which is a problem because it limits their VM configurations. They suggest using a command-line option for mounting GlusterFS via -fsdev and -device.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is related to filesystem support, which falls under 'files'. The user is dealing with how QEMU handles filesystems in their VM setup, specifically with Virtio 9P and GlusterFS. There's no mention of other areas like networking or graphics. So the category should be 'files'.
