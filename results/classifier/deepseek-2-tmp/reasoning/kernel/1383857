Okay, let's figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is having an issue with virtio disks not showing up in their guest when using AArch64 architecture. They mentioned that both blk and scsi devices aren't appearing, even after loading the necessary modules. 

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem seems related to virtio devices, specifically disks via scsi and blk interfaces. Since the modules are loaded but no devices appear, it's likely an issue with how the kernel is handling these devices. The user suspects a kernel bug since it worked in 3.16 but not in 3.18. 

The issue isn't about translation or assembly; it's more about device recognition. It doesn't fall under network, socket, or graphic issues. It could be a kernel problem because the modules aren't showing up as expected. Alternatively, since QEMU is involved and it's part of the hypervisor stack, but the user thinks it might be a kernel bug.

However, considering that the user is using QEMU with AArch64 and Virtio devices, and given the categories, 'kernel' seems appropriate because the issue is about device recognition within the guest OS, which is handled by the kernel. Alternatively, 'peripherals' could also fit since it's about hardware devices not being recognized.

But the user mentioned that they suspect a kernel bug, so 'kernel' might be the best category here.
