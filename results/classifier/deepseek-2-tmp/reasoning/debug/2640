Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "QEMU twice logging when use SDL." The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the issue is about QEMU logging twice. Logging typically relates to debugging information or output messages. Since the bug report mentions SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer), which is a library used for handling audio/video and game controls, it's often used in graphical applications within QEMU.

Looking at the categories, "debug" seems relevant because it's about logging behavior. However, SDL is more related to graphics or peripherals. But since the problem is about how logging occurs when using SDL, maybe it's an issue with the debugging output rather than the graphics itself.

Alternatively, maybe the bug is in the way QEMU interacts with SDL, causing an extra log message. Considering that, "debug" still seems appropriate because it's related to logging behavior during runtime. The other categories don't fit as well here since the issue isn't about performance, permissions, or a specific device but rather the number of log messages.

So, I think the category should be "debug."
