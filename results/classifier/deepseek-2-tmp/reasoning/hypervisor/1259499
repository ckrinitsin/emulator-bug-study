Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the problem described: The user upgraded from QEMU 1.6.0 to 1.7.0 and now can't restore a live snapshot made with 1.6.0. They get an error when reverting, which causes the VM to boot from scratch instead of resuming from the snapshot. This seems similar to a previous bug (1123975) where QEMU broke compatibility.

The key issue is that a newer version can't read a snapshot taken by an older version. Snapshots in QEMU typically involve saving the state of the virtual machine, including its memory and device states. If the newer version isn't compatible with the old snapshot format, it would fall under some kind of compatibility or state restoration problem.

The categories I need to consider: The error seems related to how the hypervisor (QEMU/KVM) handles snapshots across different versions. Since it's about restoring a VM's state and device configurations, 'hypervisor' makes sense because QEMU functions as a hypervisor for KVM. Alternatively, it could be under 'other', but since hypervisor is more specific, that's probably the right category.

Looking at the possible categories again: The options include 'hypervisor'. This bug affects the ability to restore a VM state, which directly relates to how QEMU/KVM manages virtual machines. So the issue is within the hypervisor's handling of snapshots, not something like network or graphics drivers.

The bug report pertains to the inability to restore a live snapshot across different QEMU versions, which affects the hypervisor's functionality.
