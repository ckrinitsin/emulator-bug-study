Alright, I'm trying to classify this bug report: "qemu show no error but the virtual machine stuck in boot (GPU passthrough)". Let's break it down step by step.

First, the issue is with QEMU, which relates to hypervisors. The problem is that the VM isn't booting properly—it gets stuck—without showing any errors. The mention of GPU passthrough adds context about what might be causing the issue.

Looking at the possible categories: hypervisor, device, graphic, etc. Since this involves GPU passthrough, it's related to how devices are handled in virtualization. Hypervisors manage hardware resources, including GPUs, so that's another angle.

The bug report doesn't mention errors, which suggests it might be a configuration issue or a problem with resource allocation during boot. But since the VM is stuck specifically at boot time, it's more likely related to how the hypervisor initializes devices, particularly graphics-related ones.

So, considering all this, the primary category seems to be "hypervisor" because the issue pertains to the virtualization layer handling GPU passthrough and booting. Alternatively, it could fall under "device" since it's a hardware device (GPU) not functioning correctly in the VM. However, hypervisors are more about overall system management, so I think "hypervisor" is the better fit.
