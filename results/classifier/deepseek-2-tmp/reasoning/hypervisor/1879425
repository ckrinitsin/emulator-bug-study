Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report related to QEMU. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user reports that their VM hangs after running for a few hours, up to 10 in the longest case. The OS inside the VM is RHEL 7.6 with 1 CPU and 4GB of memory. They're using QEMU KVM version 2.10.0.

When the issue occurs, the "CPU 0 /KVM" process is consuming almost 100% CPU time. They provided a function trace showing that the main loop is waiting but in a tight loop because it's constantly polling without yielding. The strace output shows repeated calls to ppoll with timeouts returning 0, indicating no data available.

The user mentions that resetting the VM fixes the issue temporarily, but it reoccurs. Increasing the number of CPUs makes the problem go away.

Looking at the categories: Mistranslation, assembly lowering, and others are more related to code generation or compilation issues. The bug seems related to how QEMU handles I/O or scheduling in KVM, which is a hypervisor feature.

The thread in question is part of the main loop waiting for events but getting stuck, possibly due to incorrect handling of device I/O or network operations. Since it's under KVM and involves high CPU usage without yielding, it points towards a hypervisor-related issue rather than something specific like graphics or sockets.

Therefore, the most fitting category is "hypervisor."

The bug report describes an issue where QEMU-KVM's main loop gets stuck in a tight poll loop, leading to near 100% CPU usage on the host. This affects the VM's performance and causes it to hang until reset or additional CPUs are added. The problem seems related to how the hypervisor handles I/O polling without yielding, which is a key aspect of KVM's operation.

**Answer:** hypervisor
