Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. Let's see what the issue is about.

The user mentioned that when running QEMU with RISC-V 64 CPUs using SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) mode, other harts are performing an illegal write at address 0x00. They think it might be because only the first hart has its code loaded, and the others aren't executing properly.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, other.

Hmm. The problem seems related to how multiple harts (cores) are handled in SMP mode. The initial code is only loaded on the first hart, causing others to misbehave. This might be an issue with how QEMU initializes or schedules instructions across all cores, leading to incorrect execution.

"mistranslation" usually refers to incorrect mapping of source architecture to target IR, which happens in user-mode. I'm not sure if this is a user-mode issue or more related to kernel/hypervisor.

"boot" could be relevant since it's about the initial setup, but the problem occurs during execution after boot.

The other harts are doing illegal writes because they might not have valid code. This could be an issue with how QEMU sets up each hart's context, possibly a bug in the hypervisor or kernel initialization part.

Wait, perhaps it's related to how the hypervisor schedules or loads the initial code onto all harts. If only one has code, others are executing garbage or default instructions, leading to illegal operations.

So, considering that, "hypervisor" seems like a fitting category since it deals with managing virtual CPUs and their execution environments.
