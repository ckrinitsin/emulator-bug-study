Alright, I'm trying to classify this bug report. The user mentioned an assertion failure when using VFIO passthrough with their Nvidia GTX 770 after a specific commit. The error message points to a problem in hw/pci/pcie.c at line 240.

Looking at the provided git bisect output, the first bad commit is 5e95494380ecf83c97d28f72134ab45e0cace8f9. The commit message says it's switching to a generic hotplug handling for PCIDevice, making qdev_unplug() and device_set_realized() call the hotplug handler methods if available, removing legacy handling where possible.

The assertion failure is in pcie_cap_slot_hotplug_common(), which checks if (pci_dev->devfn & 0x07) == 0. This likely relates to how devices are being handled during hotplug events after the commit changed the handling logic.

Since this is related to PCIE device handling and specifically involves hotplug functionality, it's tied to the hypervisor or KVM acceleration because VFIO is used for GPU passthrough in KVM. The issue arises from a change in how devices are managed during hotplug, causing an assertion failure when using VFIO-passthrough.

Therefore, the bug falls under the "hypervisor" category because it pertains to KVM's handling of PCIE devices and their hotplug mechanisms.
