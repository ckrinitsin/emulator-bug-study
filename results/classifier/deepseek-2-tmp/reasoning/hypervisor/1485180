Okay, I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU. Let me read through it carefully.

The user mentions using Fedora 22 and having issues with multiple virtual machines. They describe that pressing Ctrl-Alt-G works once but fails the second time when switching between VMs. Also, Alt-F4 quits the application regardless of whether they're in full-screen mode or not, but only when two VMs are running.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. The problem seems to be related to how input is handled, specifically with keyboard shortcuts and switching between VMs. Since Ctrl-Alt-G isn't working as expected for gaining focus after multiple presses and Alt-F4 causes the application to quit, this points towards an issue in how the hypervisor handles input or window management.

I'm considering whether it's a graphic-related issue because it involves window focus and display behavior, but the problem also affects keyboard functionality across VMs. The hypervisor category seems more appropriate since QEMU's KVM is involved in managing multiple VMs, and the bug appears to stem from how the host handles input redirection between different virtual machines.

Therefore, I think the best classification here would be 'hypervisor' because it relates to the management of multiple VM instances and their interaction with host resources like input devices.
