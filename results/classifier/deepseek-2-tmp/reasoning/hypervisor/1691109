Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The user is reporting that qemu-kvm isn't working when nested inside ESX 6.0. They mention using Ubuntu 16.04 with a specific version of qemu-kvm and launching CirrOS via OpenStack. The VM starts but gets stuck at "booting from hard disk" when using the machine type 'pc-i440fx-zesty'. However, changing it to 'pc-i440fx-2.3' fixes the issue. They also note that ISO boots work fine, suggesting it's related to block device configuration in newer machine types.

Looking at the possible categories: hypervisor is one of them. Since ESX is a VMware product and the user is running KVM (qemu-kvm) inside it, this seems like a nested virtualization issue. The problem arises with specific machine configurations, which points towards compatibility or setup issues in a hypervisor environment.

Other categories like 'boot' or 'block devices' are relevant but more specific parts of the system. However, since the main context is running KVM under ESX (a hypervisor), the most fitting category is 'hypervisor'.
