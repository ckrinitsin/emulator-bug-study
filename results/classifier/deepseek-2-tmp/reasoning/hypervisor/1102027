Okay, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user mentioned that after rebooting their VM, it reverted to an old date (8 Oct 2012), causing them to lose all data since then. They checked the QED file and found that mounting it on another VM worked fine, so the issue isn't with the storage itself but likely how the hypervisor handles time or state.

Looking at the possible categories: There's 'hypervisor' which relates to issues directly under QEMU's management. The problem seems related to how the VM is being managed or possibly how snapshots are handled, though they mentioned no snapshots were used. Since it's about data loss after a reboot, it could be a bug in how QEMU manages the virtual machine's state or storage. 'Kernel' might relate if it's an issue within the guest OS, but since it's about the hypervisor's handling of the VM state, 'hypervisor' seems more appropriate.
