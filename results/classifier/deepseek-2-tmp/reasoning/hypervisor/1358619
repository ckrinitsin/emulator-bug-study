Alright, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user mentioned issues with savevm and loadvm commands causing crashes during migration. They’re using KVM and QEMU on CentOS 6.4.

First, looking at the error messages: one says "qcow2: Preventing invalid write..." which points to a problem when writing to the image file. Another error is "-22 while loading VM state," which usually means an issue with file operations or permissions.

The user also noted that this happens during migration between two hosts, but works fine on the same host without migration. So it's likely related to how QEMU handles saving/loading across different instances, possibly due to race conditions or improper synchronization when migrating.

Looking at possible categories: savevm/loadvm is about state management, which ties into the hypervisor’s functions since KVM/QEMU manages virtual machines. Migration itself is handled by QEMU/KVM, so it's part of the hypervisor operations.

The errors seem to stem from how the snapshot files are being accessed or written during migration. It doesn't look like a translation issue (mistranslation) or an assembly problem (assembly lowering). It's more about the state management and hypervisor handling.

So, considering all this, it fits under 'hypervisor' category.
