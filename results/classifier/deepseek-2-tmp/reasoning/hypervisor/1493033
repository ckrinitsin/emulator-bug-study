Okay, so I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user provided a detailed description of the issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem is about memory leak or high memory usage when using the Spice webdav feature. Specifically, when copying big files from the client to the guest, the host's memory consumption spikes and doesn't get freed. 

Looking at the provided information, the bug is linked to a comment on a Freedesktop.org bug report. The user mentions that this is partially due to Spice's memory pool not having an upper limit. They also reference patches sent in a mailing list, which suggests that there have been attempts to fix this issue but it hasn't been fully resolved yet.

The version used is QEMU 2.3.93 with SPICE and SPICE-GTK from the git master. Steps to reproduce are outlined clearly, involving setting up Spice-GTK with WebDAV enabled, starting a VM, mounting the shared folder, and copying a large file. The actual result is that QEMU's memory usage grows significantly during the copy and isn't released.

The user provided details about massif showing high memory usage by QEMU, pointing to malloc_and_trace in vl.c as a major source. This seems related to how QEMU handles memory allocation for coroutines when transferring files.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about high memory usage specifically when using WebDAV for file sharing between the host and guest. The problem lies in how QEMU (the hypervisor) manages memory during this process. It's not related to assembly translation or graphics issues. Since it's a memory management problem within QEMU, it's likely under the 'hypervisor' category because that's part of QEMU's core functionality.

Alternatively, one might consider 'performance' since it's about resource usage, but 'hypervisor' seems more precise here because it pertains to how the hypervisor handles memory during guest operations like file transfers.

The bug report describes an issue with high memory usage in QEMU when using the Spice WebDAV feature for transferring large files. This is related to how the hypervisor (QEMU) manages memory resources during such operations, leading to a memory leak that isn't freed after file transfer.

**Answer:**

hypervisor
