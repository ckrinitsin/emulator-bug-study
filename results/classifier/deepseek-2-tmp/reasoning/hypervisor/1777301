Okay, let's try to classify this bug report step by step. The user is experiencing a boot failure after installing Checkpoint Pointsec FDE on their Windows 10 guest machine running under QEMU/KVM on CentOS 7. 

First, the error message in the log file mentions "KVM internal error. Suberror: 1" and "emulation failure". KVM stands for Kernel-based Virtual Machine, which is a hypervisor for Linux. The fact that it's a KVM internal error suggests that there's something wrong within the virtualization layer itself.

Looking at the installed software, they have QEMU packages like qemu-guest-agent, qemu-img-ev, etc., and their CPU supports virtualization (as seen in the flags: vmx). So the hardware support isn't an issue here.

The user didn't mention any issues before installing Checkpoint's FDE, so it's likely that the encryption software is causing a conflict with QEMU/KVM. Maybe Pointsec FDE modifies some system configurations or drivers that interfere with the hypervisor during boot.

Since the error points directly to KVM and there's no indication of problems in other areas like network, graphics, or devices (other than perhaps the encryption), the most fitting category is "hypervisor". The issue seems related to how KVM is handling the virtual machine after a specific software installation, which impacts the boot process.
