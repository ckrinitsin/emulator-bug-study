Okay, I'm trying to figure out the category for this bug report in QEMU. The user mentioned that when they start a second VM using the command line, QEMU crashes immediately. Let me look at the details provided.

They're running on a 64-bit x86 platform with Ubuntu 14.04 and used the latest QEMU from GitHub. The first VM starts without issues, but the second one causes a crash. The log shows "KVM internal error. Suberror: 1" which indicates a problem related to KVM.

I remember that KVM is involved in virtualization; it's part of the hypervisor layer in Linux for managing virtual machines. So if there's an issue with KVM, it likely falls under the hypervisor category.

Looking at the error message and the command line arguments, they're using several KVM-related options like -enable-kvm and memory-backend-file for hugepages. The crash happens when launching the second VM, suggesting a possible resource conflict or misconfiguration between the two instances of QEMU running with KVM enabled.

Other categories like 'device' or 'graphic' don't seem to fit here because the issue isn't about hardware devices or graphical rendering. It's more about the hypervisor's ability to manage multiple VMs simultaneously, which points directly to the hypervisor category.
