Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is having trouble with QEMU not supporting NUMA node binding on their system. They mentioned they're using Debian 8 and OpenStack Kilo. 

First, I need to understand what NUMA node binding means in the context of QEMU. NUMA stands for Non-Uniform Memory Access, which is a computer memory design used in multiprocessors. In virtualization, NUMA node binding allows VMs to be assigned to specific CPU nodes to optimize performance.

The user is trying to launch a VM with numa pinning but isn't successful. They noticed that the issue was fixed in Ubuntu and are wondering if it's possible to build QEMU with CONFIG_NUMA enabled on Debian where libnuma is present.

Looking at the categories provided, I see options like "mistranslation," "assembly," "other," etc., including more specific ones like "hypervisor" or "kernel." 

Since the issue is about NUMA support in QEMU, which relates to how virtual machines are scheduled and resource allocation on the host system, it's likely tied to the hypervisor's capabilities. The hypervisor (QEMU/KVM) needs to handle NUMA configurations correctly for VMs.

I don't think this falls under "mistranslation" or "assembly" because those relate more to code translation issues. It also doesn't seem like a performance issue unless it's about resource allocation affecting speed, but the main problem is support missing.

The user's question is about enabling NUMA in QEMU build, which might involve configuration flags or dependencies, so maybe "hypervisor" is the right category as it pertains to how the hypervisor handles hardware features like NUMA.
