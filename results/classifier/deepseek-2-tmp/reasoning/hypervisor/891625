Alright, I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user provided a list of possible categories and wants me to pick one based on the given bug report.

The bug report says: "add vhost-net to kvm group udev rules 65-kvm.rules" and mentions authorizing the kvm group to access vhost-net, similar to how the kvm device is handled. 

I know that QEMU uses KVM for virtualization. Vhost-net is related to network virtualization in QEMU/KVM setups. The issue here is about udev rules, which are part of the system's device management, specifically handling permissions and access to devices.

Looking at the categories provided: hypervisor, kernel, peripherals, etc. Hypervisor makes sense because KVM is a hypervisor, and vhost-net is part of the virtualization stack. The user is talking about group permissions for KVM, which is handled via udev rules tied to the hypervisor setup.

Other categories like 'network' might be relevant, but the main focus here is on the kvm group's access rights, which falls under hypervisor configuration. So I think 'hypervisor' is the right category.
