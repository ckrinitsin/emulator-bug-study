Okay, I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about a VM status remaining "running" after it's suspended on aarch64. The user followed steps to suspend the guest and then checked the status via HMP, which still showed "running". They suspect the problem lies with ACPI code not calling qemu_system_wakeup_request().

Looking at the categories, "suspended" relates to VM state management, which is controlled by the hypervisor. KVM is a hypervisor, but in this context, since QEMU's part is being discussed and it interacts with KVM as a user-space manager, perhaps the issue falls under hypervisor category as it pertains to managing the guest's state.

Alternatively, "other" could be a possibility if none of the specific categories fit. But given that it's related to VM status and possibly involves ACPI code which interacts with hardware virtualization (KVM), I think hypervisor is more appropriate.
