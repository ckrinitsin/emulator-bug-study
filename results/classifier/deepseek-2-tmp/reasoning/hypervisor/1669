Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's see what the problem is.

The user reported a memory leak when using pci-ohci as the USB controller in an ARM environment with CentOS-8-aarch64. They followed specific steps: starting the VM with pci-ohci, installing the OS, and then noticed QEMU taking up more memory over time, indicating a memory leak.

Looking at the categories provided, I should consider which one fits best. The bug is related to resource management (memory) in QEMU. Since it's about memory usage within the hypervisor or emulator, "hypervisor" seems like a strong candidate because QEMU acts as a hypervisor when running virtual machines.

Other options: It doesn't seem to be a mistranslation or assembly issue. It's not related to devices, graphics, sockets, network directly, nor is it about KVM specifically (though KVM is part of the system, the leak is in QEMU). Boot, VNC, debug, files, permissions, performance could be possible, but "performance" relates more to speed rather than resource leaks. "Kernel" and "peripherals" don't seem directly relevant here.

So, considering that the issue occurs during VM operation under QEMU's management, the most appropriate category is "hypervisor."
