Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user provided a list of possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report says that suspending a domain works with a 3.16 guest kernel but not with a 4.16 one. When using `systemctl suspend`, the behavior differs between the two kernels. Specifically, with QXL card (which is related to SPICE), the display goes black and the domain remains running in libvirt but is "dead". With VGA card, the screen goes black and comes back immediately, but the domain stays fine.

I need to figure out which category this falls into. The issue is about suspending a domain, which relates to how the hypervisor (QEMU) interacts with the guest OS during power management operations. Since the problem occurs when using different kernels, it's likely related to the interaction between QEMU and the guest OS's suspend mechanism.

Looking at the categories: 'hypervisor' seems appropriate because the issue is about how QEMU/KVM handles the suspend operation across different guest kernels. It's not a mistranslation or assembly issue since the problem isn't in the code translation or assembly lowering. The issue isn't directly related to networking, sockets, performance, or permissions either.

The problem occurs during a system call (suspend), which is handled by the hypervisor layer. So 'hypervisor' is the best fit.
