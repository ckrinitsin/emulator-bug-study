Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is requesting that QEMU implement a "-cpu best" option or another method to handle CPU selection. They provided examples of commands using "-cpu best" and "-cpu host:qemu64". The link they included is from Red Hat's Bugzilla, specifically issue 1277744.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The bug report is about CPU selection and fallback options in QEMU when using KVM acceleration with TCG as a secondary option. This falls under the hypervisor category because it's related to how QEMU manages virtual CPUs, especially in a KVM environment where hardware-assisted virtualization is involved.

So the correct category should be "hypervisor".
