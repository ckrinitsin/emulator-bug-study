Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "netdev tftp option docs don't mention that the TFTP server is read-only." The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the bug report, it's about the documentation for the netdev tftp option. The issue is that the docs don't mention that the TFTP server is read-only. So this isn't a translation or assembly problem. It's related to network device configuration because TFTP is a network protocol used for file transfer.

The category 'network' seems appropriate here since it pertains to network device settings and documentation. Other options like 'device' could be considered, but 'network' is more specific. So the best fit is 'network'.
