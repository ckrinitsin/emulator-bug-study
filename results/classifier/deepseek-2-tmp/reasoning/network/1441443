Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user is asking about creating a 10G network interface for VMs in KVM2.0 using QEMU. They've set up KVM with bridged mode and are only seeing 1G options for their VMs. The available device models includevirtio among others.

First, the issue revolves around network configuration within KVM/QEMU. The user is concerned about the maximum speed achievable in their VMs. Since they're using virtio as the device model, which is known for better performance than older models like rtl8139 or e1000, but perhaps it's still limited.

I remember that network performance in KVM/QEMU can be influenced by several factors: the device model used, the virtual switch (like VirtioNet), and the host's physical network setup. The user mentioned their host is connected to a 10G network, so the hardware should support it.

Looking at the categories provided, "network" seems appropriate because the issue directly relates to VM network interface configuration and performance. Other relevant categories like "hypervisor" or "kernel" could be considered, but since the focus is on networking within KVM, "network" fits best.
