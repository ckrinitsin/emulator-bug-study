Okay, I need to classify this bug report according to the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is reporting an issue with networking in QEMU versions 2.0.0 and beyond when using Open Solaris (Illumos) 5.11 as the guest OS. They mention that the VM becomes deaf, meaning it can't communicate properly over the network. 

Looking at the setup, they built QEMU with certain configurations and used commands to run a VM. Notably, they have --enable-kvm, which suggests KVM acceleration is enabled. However, while a Windows 7 image works fine across all builds, Solaris doesn't get networking right starting from version 2.0.0.

The symptoms include the Solaris VM arping for its own interface but not responding correctly to pings. This points towards a network configuration issue specific to how QEMU handles Solaris guests with KVM enabled.

Considering the categories provided: 'network' is directly related, as it's about network functionality. The other options like 'hypervisor' or 'KVM' might be relevant since KVM is involved, but the primary issue is networking behavior in the guest OS.
