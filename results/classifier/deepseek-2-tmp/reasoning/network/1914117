Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The user is experiencing issues with FTP where files are returned shorter than expected on Mac OS X Big Sur using QEMU 5.2. They tried different architectures like arm64, amd64, and i386 across various OSes like NetBSD and OpenBSD.

The problem occurs consistently when downloading files via FTP, such as perl source or bind, which suggests it's related to how data is being transferred over the network. The user also mentioned that QEMU 4.2 on Ubuntu works fine, implying that the issue might be specific to the Mac version or a regression in version 5.2.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem seems to affect file transfers over FTP, which is a network protocol. The user suspects it's in the network layer. So the most fitting category would be 'network' because it relates to how data is handled during transmission.
