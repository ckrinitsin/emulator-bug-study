Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem and see what's going on here.

The user is talking about QEMU/NBD connections and TLS encryption. They mention that currently, NBD starts in plaintext and then upgrades to TLS, similar to STARTTLS. However, they point out some downsides: it reveals that NBD is being used, there might be bugs in the negotiation code, and it's harder to inspect for compliance.

They suggest adding an option to do TLS from the start instead of after NBD negotiation. They compare it to SMTP where you can have TLS-only mode. The goal seems to be enhancing security by making the connection fully encrypted from the beginning without any plaintext exchange.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, other.

I think this is related to how QEMU handles network connections and encryption. The user wants TLS to be enforced without any initial cleartext phase. This sounds like a networking issue because it's about the communication between QEMU processes or over the network using NBD (Network Block Device). So, the category should relate to network.

Wait, but another thought: is this about how the code handles protocol translations or security in the hypervisor? But no, it's more about the network layer and encryption setup. So 'network' seems appropriate.

The bug report discusses enhancing the security of QEMU/NBD connections by enabling TLS-only mode without initial plaintext exchange, which relates to network communication.
