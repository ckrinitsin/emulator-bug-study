Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "Qemu - Bridge direct network connection not working". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the issue is about QEMU and a bridge in networking. Bridges in networking are used to connect different networks or segments, so it's related to how QEMU handles network connections. The problem seems to be that the direct network connection through the bridge isn't functioning, which points towards an issue with the network configuration or handling within QEMU.

Looking at the categories: 'network' is one of them, and that seems directly relevant here because the bug is about a network feature (bridge) not working. The other options like device or peripherals might be related, but device usually refers to hardware devices in the VM, while network specifically deals with connectivity. So I think 'network' is the most accurate category for this bug report.
