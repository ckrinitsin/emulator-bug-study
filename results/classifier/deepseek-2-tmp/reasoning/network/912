Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "Cannot access RHEL8_s390x installed OS using SSH from host OS network". Let's break it down.

First, the issue is about not being able to access an installed OS via SSH. The guest OS is RHEL8 on s390x architecture, and the problem occurs when trying to connect from the host network. 

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, etc. Since SSH involves networking and communication between the host and guest, it's likely related to network configuration or setup in QEMU.

Possible causes could be incorrect port forwarding, missing network interfaces, or firewall issues within QEMU. These are all network-related problems. So, the category should be 'network'.

The issue is related to SSH connectivity between the host and the guest OS, which points to a network configuration problem in QEMU.

**Answer:** network
