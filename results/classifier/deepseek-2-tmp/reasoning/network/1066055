Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through it carefully.

The user is reporting a network performance regression with vde_switch. They used to get about 1.5 Gbits/s but now only get around 320 Mbits/s. They noticed that there were changes in hw/virtio* files, not net/vde.*. Their command line uses virtio-net-pci and vde0 as the netdev.

They're using KVM with a host kernel 3.6.1 and guest 3.5.4. The issue also occurs with other versions. They mention that using tun/tap gives better performance, so it's specifically related to how the network is being handled in QEMU.

The categories include things like 'network', which seems directly relevant here since the problem is about network performance between host and guest. Other possible categories are 'hypervisor' or 'kernel', but I think 'network' is more specific.
