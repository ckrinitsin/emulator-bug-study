Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user is experiencing very slow network performance between Windows guests on KVM. They've tried different network drivers and configurations without much improvement.

First, I need to look at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, etc. The issue here is related to network speed, so it's definitely a networking problem.

They mention using openvswitch for bridging and bonding NICs, which suggests that the virtual switch setup might be involved. However, the primary symptom is slow data transfer between two Windows guests, while transfers involving the host or Linux guests are much faster. This points towards an issue with how QEMU/KVM handles network traffic specifically between certain guest configurations.

Possible causes could include incorrect configuration of VirtIO drivers, misconfigured virtual switches, or issues in how QEMU maps network packets. Since it's not a performance problem across all setups but only between Windows guests, it might be related to how the hypervisor (QEMU/KVM) handles network emulation for Windows guests.

Considering the categories again, "network" seems to fit because the problem is directly about network performance. There's no mention of assembly or mistranslation issues here, so other categories like device or graphic don't apply.
