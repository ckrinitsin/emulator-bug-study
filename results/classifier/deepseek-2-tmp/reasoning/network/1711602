Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report related to QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The user is reporting an issue with `virsh migrate --live --copy-storage-all` failing when using QEMU 2.10. They mention that they fixed a disk locking issue related to qemu-nbd but are still encountering problems. The error logs show that the monitor was closed unexpectedly, and there's an Input/output error during migration.

Looking at the source and target libvirt logs, there are errors about being unable to read from the socket due to "Connection reset by peer." This suggests a network or socket-related problem. The user also notes that without old errors but after some time (which would be the copy), it fails, implying that the issue occurs during the data transfer phase.

Possible categories include network and socket. Since the error seems related to communication between the source and target during migration, which involves sockets for data transfer, I think this falls under 'network' or perhaps 'socket'. However, since the primary function here is network communication between qemu instances during migration, 'network' might be more appropriate.
