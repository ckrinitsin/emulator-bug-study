Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem again.

The user is reporting that tap connections aren't working on a Windows host using QEMU version 2.2.0 64-bit. They've set up a VM with Slackware 14.0 64bit, and they're using OpenVPN's TAP adapter named tap01. The command line includes the net nic and net tap options with ifname=tap01. 

They mentioned that the TAP is bridged with the real network adapter, and both the host and VM have IPs on the same subnet (10.1.1.x). However, the VM can't communicate with other machines on the local network, and neither can the others reach it. This worked in earlier QEMU versions (0.9 32bit), so something has changed that's causing this issue.

Now, looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about network connectivity between the VM and the host/other machines. The problem lies in how the TAP connection is handled by QEMU on Windows. Since it's related to network communication, I think 'network' is the appropriate category.
