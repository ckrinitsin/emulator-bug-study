Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user mentioned it's part of QEMU and provided possible categories like mistranslation, assembly, device, etc.

Looking at the bug report, the issue is about KVM guests using LVM-backed drives experiencing high iowait times due to caching settings. The reporter suggests that defaulting cache to 'none' improves performance. They also reference some URLs which likely discuss this problem in QEMU/KVM context.

The categories related here are 'KVM' since it's directly about the hypervisor, and possibly 'performance' because it affects system performance. However, the main focus is on KVM configuration, so I think 'KVM' is more appropriate.
