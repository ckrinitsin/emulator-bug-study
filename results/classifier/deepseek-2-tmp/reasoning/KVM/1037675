Alright, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is having an issue with their QEMU-KVM setup where the guest kernel panics when using "-cpu host". They upgraded from version 1.0.1-r1 to 1.1.1-r1 and noticed the problem.

First, I'll break down what's happening here. The bug occurs when they specify "-cpu host", which tells QEMU to use the host's CPU configuration for the guest. This is typically used for better performance and compatibility. But in this case, it causes a panic during boot, specifically at intel_pmu_init.

Looking at the provided categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. The issue seems related to how the CPU is being emulated or handled by QEMU-KVM.

The fact that removing "-cpu host" fixes the problem suggests it's something specific to how the host CPU features are exposed to the guest. This could be a problem in the translation layer between the host and target architecture, but since KVM is involved (as indicated by -enable-kvm), it might be related to the hypervisor or kernel modules.

I recall that intel_pmu_init is part of the Intel Performance Monitoring Unit, which is often handled by specific KVM modules. Maybe there's a regression in how QEMU-KVM 1.1.1 interacts with this when using "-cpu host". This could relate to the hypervisor layer since KVM runs as a hypervisor on top of the host OS.

Alternatively, it might be an issue within the device emulation or specific hardware features exposed by the host CPU that aren't being handled correctly in QEMU-KVM 1.1.1. But considering the kernel panic at intel_pmu_init and the involvement of KVM modules, I'm leaning towards it being a hypervisor-related issue.

Wait, but "hypervisor" is one of the categories. So maybe this is indeed under the "KVM" or "hypervisor" category. However, looking back, the user included "KVM" as one of the possible categories, so perhaps that's the right fit.

But another angle: if it's a problem in how QEMU translates CPU instructions when using "-cpu host", that might fall under "mistranslation". But considering KVM is involved and it's more about the hypervisor's handling of CPU features, I think "KVM" or possibly "hypervisor" would be appropriate.

Wait, but looking at the categories again, there are separate options: "KVM" and "hypervisor". Since KVM itself is a hypervisor, perhaps this issue is under the broader "hypervisor" category. However, given that it's specifically related to QEMU-KVM, which is the KVM component of QEMU, maybe "KVM" is more precise.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes issues with CPU handling in QEMU can be part of the translation layer (mistranslation). Alternatively, if it's about how KVM presents CPU features to the guest, that might fall under hypervisor or KVM.

Wait, but in this case, the user is using "-cpu host", which enables host-passthrough. If there's a problem with this feature causing a panic, it could be due to incorrect handling of certain CPU instructions or features by QEMU-KVM when acting as the hypervisor. So perhaps "hypervisor" is more accurate.

Alternatively, if it's a bug in how QEMU translates the host CPU's PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit) events into something the guest can handle, that might be "mistranslation". But given that KVM is involved and it's a kernel module interacting with hardware features, I think "hypervisor" or "KVM" would be better.

Wait, but looking back at the categories provided by the user: KVM is listed as one of them. So perhaps the correct category is "KVM". But sometimes hypervisor issues in QEMU-KVM are under the "hypervisor" category. I'm a bit torn here.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to how the guest OS initializes certain hardware features, which could be a device-related issue. But no, since it's a kernel panic during PMU init, which is more about CPU and hypervisor interaction.

I think the best fit would be "hypervisor", but given that KVM is a specific part of QEMU, perhaps "KVM" is intended as its own category. So I'm leaning towards "KVM".

The bug report involves a kernel panic when using `-cpu host` in QEMU-KVM 1.1.1, specifically during `intel_pmu_init`. This suggests an issue with how the hypervisor (QEMU-KVM) handles CPU features or hardware interactions, particularly under the Intel PMU subsystem. Since the problem arises from enabling host CPU configuration and is related to KVM's operation, it falls under the "hypervisor" category.

**hypervisor**

However, since "-cpu host" interacts directly with the KVM hypervisor layer, the correct category is:

**KVM**
