Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let's break it down.

The user is having an issue when running `./configure` and gets a "big/little test failed" error while trying to statically link on Fedora 36. They mentioned that they couldn't find any information about this, so they're unsure how to fix it.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. I need to figure out which one fits best.

The error message mentions a "big/little test failed." I'm not entirely sure what that refers to in QEMU's context. It might be related to CPU architecture or something else. Since the user is trying to build QEMU with static linking and specific flags, maybe it's an issue during the configuration or compilation process.

I know that KVM is a hypervisor technology used by QEMU for virtualization. The user included `--enable-kvm` in their configure command. So perhaps this error is related to KVM support not being correctly detected or enabled.

Alternatively, "big/little" could refer to CPU configurations, but I'm not sure how that ties into the build process here. Since the error occurs during configuration and static linking, it's more likely a setup issue rather than an assembly or translation problem.

Another angle: the user is on Fedora 36, so maybe there are missing dependencies or library issues specific to their distribution when building statically. But the categories don't have 'distribution' or 'dependency' as options, so that might fall under 'other.'

However, since KVM was explicitly enabled and it's a key feature for QEMU's hypervisor capabilities, the error could be related to KVM initialization or detection during the build.

Wait, but the problem occurs in `./configure`, which is part of the build setup, not necessarily the runtime. So maybe it's a configuration test failure when checking for KVM support. The 'big/little' might refer to CPU features or endianness tests.

I'm not entirely certain, but given that KVM was enabled and the error occurs during configure, which is part of the build setup, I think the closest category would be KVM.

The bug report mentions an issue when enabling KVM with `--enable-kvm` in the configuration. The error occurs during the `./configure` step, suggesting a problem related to KVM support detection. Therefore, it falls under the KVM category.
