Alright, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user mentioned that the category should be a single word from the provided list. Let me read through the problem again.

The bug report is about requesting a runtime option in QEMU to expose the supported list of keymaps for VNC. They referenced a discussion in the ganeti group, so it's related to VNC configuration or functionality.

Looking at the categories: There are several options like graphic, vnc, etc. Since this is specifically about VNC and its keymap support, "vnc" seems like the most appropriate category. I don't see any other category that fits better, like maybe 'graphic' could be considered, but since it's directly related to VNC features, "vnc" is more precise.
