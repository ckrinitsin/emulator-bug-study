Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned an issue with QEMU's VNC WebSocket option not being parsed correctly when run from the command line. They noticed that using "-vnc host:port,websocket" stopped working in version 2.3.0 and started giving an error.

The error message they provided is about failing to resolve the address for 'tor:on' which suggests that QEMU isn't handling the WebSocket option properly. The user tried different formats like replacing the hostname with an IP and using "-display vnc=..." but still faced the same issue.

Looking at the categories, I need to see which one fits best. It's related to VNC functionality, so 'vnc' is a primary category. But also, it seems to be about parsing command-line options correctly, which might fall under 'other' since it's not directly about performance or hardware issues. However, since the core issue is with the WebSocket option in VNC, 'vnc' is more specific.

I think the appropriate category here is 'vnc' because the problem is specific to how QEMU handles the VNC options and their parsing.
