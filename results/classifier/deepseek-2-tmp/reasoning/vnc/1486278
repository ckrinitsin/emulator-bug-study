Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through it carefully.

The user ran a QEMU command with VNC and websocket parameters. They used 'info vnc' in the monitor and didn't see any websocket info. Instead, they saw address 0.0.0.0:5901. However, netstat showed that port 5701 is being listened on.

The issue seems to be related to how QEMU's VNC server reports its parameters. The 'info vnc' command isn't displaying the websocket information even though it was started with those options.

Looking at the categories provided: There's a category called "vnc". This bug affects the functionality of the VNC monitor command, which directly relates to the VNC subsystem in QEMU.

So, the most appropriate category is "vnc".

The issue pertains to the 'info vnc' command not showing websocket information. Since this is related to how VNC parameters are reported, the correct category is:

vnc
