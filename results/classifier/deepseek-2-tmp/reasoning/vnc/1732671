Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through it carefully.

The bug report mentions an issue with VNC and WebSocket compatibility. Specifically, IE 11/Edge isn't working with noVNC HTML5 client when using a WebSocket connection. The problem is that QEMU checks the `Upgrade` header in a case-sensitive manner, but IE sends 'W' instead of 'w'. According to RFC6455, this should be case-insensitive.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The bug is related to VNC and WebSocket handling, so 'vnc' seems directly relevant. It's not a translation issue or something with assembly code. The problem isn't about the hypervisor or other listed categories either. Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'vnc'.
