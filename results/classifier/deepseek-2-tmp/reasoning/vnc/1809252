Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user provided several options like mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, etc., up to hypervisor. 

The bug report is about password authentication in FIPS-compliant mode with VNC. It mentions that password auth isn't supported because it uses DES cipher which isn't allowed under FIPS 140-2. The user is asking if QEMU can use a different cipher to re-enable password authentication.

So, the issue revolves around VNC and its authentication method in compliance mode. VNC is related to graphical remote access, so the category should be 'graphic'. Alternatively, it could fall under network since VNC runs over networks, but the primary issue is with the graphical protocol's authentication feature.

The bug report pertains to password authentication within the VNC protocol when operating in FIPS 140-2 compliance mode. This involves the use of encryption ciphers and their impact on authentication support.
