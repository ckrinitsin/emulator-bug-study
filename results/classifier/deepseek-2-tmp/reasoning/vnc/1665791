Alright, let's figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is asking if they can create two displays in QEMU on Windows 10, each accessible through separate VNC connections. They mentioned that this works with SPICE but prefer using VNC.

First, I need to consider the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The topic here is about having multiple displays with separate VNC connections. This relates to how QEMU handles display output and remote access. Since the user specifically mentions VNC connections, it's likely related to the VNC feature in QEMU.

Looking at the categories, "vnc" seems directly relevant because the issue is about connecting via VNC. The other possible category could be "graphic" since it involves displays, but the primary focus is on using multiple VNC sessions, which ties more closely to the VNC functionality rather than graphics handling in general.

I don't think this falls under categories like network or socket directly, as those would relate more to underlying connection mechanisms, not the display setup. "Graphic" might be a contender, but since the user is asking about VNC connections specifically, "vnc" is more precise.
