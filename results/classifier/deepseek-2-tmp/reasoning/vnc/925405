Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is about VNC server not working with Mac Screen Sharing. The user tried different QEMU targets and setups but the connection fails after setup without sending pixmap data. They suspect issues with negotiation logic in QEMU's VNC handling.

Looking at the categories, 'vnc' directly relates to the issue since it's a problem with the VNC server functionality. Other categories like network or socket could be related, but the primary issue is within the VNC implementation of QEMU.

The bug report is about the VNC server in QEMU not functioning correctly when accessed from a Mac using its Screen Sharing feature. The user describes that connections are attempted but fail to complete the negotiation process, leading to no pixmap data being sent. This suggests an issue with how QEMU's VNC server handles the protocol or encoding used by the Mac client.

Given the categories provided, the most appropriate classification is 'vnc' because the problem specifically pertains to the interaction between QEMU's VNC server and the Mac's VNC client during the negotiation phase. This falls under the functionality of the VNC implementation within QEMU.

**Answer:**
vnc
