Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories related to QEMU. Let me read through the report carefully.

The user describes an issue where the mouse is behaving erratically under Windows 95 when using QEMU. Specifically, every 20-30 seconds, moving the mouse causes the pointer to move quickly around the screen and randomly click buttons, making the system unusable. They're not sure if it's related to another bug (1785485) but note that the problem occurs even without using the scroll wheel.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals. 

Hmm. The issue is about mouse behavior in a virtualized environment. Since it's related to input devices (mouse), which are typically handled as peripherals in QEMU. So 'peripherals' seems like the most fitting category.

I don't think it's 'graphic' because that would relate more to visual rendering issues, not input device actions. It also doesn't seem like a network or socket issue, nor does it involve booting, VNC, or other listed categories.

So I'll go with 'peripherals'.
