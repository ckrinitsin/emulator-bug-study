Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The user is experiencing an issue where their mouse gets grabbed automatically when moving over the QEMU window. They expected that the mouse would only be grabbed if they manually pressed the release/grab combination (like Ctrl-Alt). Now, every time the mouse moves over or within the window, it's grabbing again, which prevents them from using window-manager hotkeys.

They mentioned testing this with different VGA types and window managers without any difference, so it doesn't seem to be a driver-specific issue. The problem occurs consistently across setups, pointing towards an issue in how QEMU handles mouse input.

Looking at the command line, they're using "-usb -usbdevice tablet" which likely configures the virtual USB devices for the VM. The expected behavior is that the mouse should only be grabbed when explicitly releasing and grabbing again, not automatically on movement.

I need to map this issue to one of the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

The problem relates to mouse input handling, specifically how QEMU grabs the mouse. Since it's about the interaction between the host's windowing system and the QEMU window, this falls under the category of peripherals because it's dealing with hardware devices (mouse) and their behavior within the virtual machine environment.

So, the category that best fits this bug is 'peripherals'.
