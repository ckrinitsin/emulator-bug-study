Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "qemu-git gravis ultrasound not working". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, let's parse the bug report. It mentions QEMU-GIT and two terms: "gravis ultrasound". I know that Gravis is a manufacturer of joysticks and other input devices. The Ultrasound might refer to a specific model or product. So it seems like this is related to an input device not working correctly under QEMU.

Looking at the categories, 'peripherals' would cover devices like joysticks, which are input peripherals. Other categories like 'device' could also fit, but 'peripherals' is more specific to input/output devices such as mice, keyboards, and joysticks.

I don't see any indication that this is related to translation errors (mistranslation), assembly issues, or other areas like network or graphic problems. It's about a device not functioning, so peripherals is the best fit.
