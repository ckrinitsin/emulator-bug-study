Okay, so I need to classify this bug report for QEMU where qemu-xhci isn't working on aarch64. The user mentioned that when they run lsusb inside the VM, no devices are listed. Let me think about what categories are available.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is with qemu-xhci not working. Qemu-xhci is part of QEMU's USB controller for virtual machines. Since it's related to the xHCI (USB 3.0) controller and the VM isn't detecting devices, this seems to be a hardware-related problem in the virtual machine setup.

So, considering the categories, 'peripherals' makes sense because it's about how the VM's hardware devices are emulated or handled. The USB devices aren't showing up, which points towards a problem with the peripherals configuration or handling in QEMU on aarch64 systems.

The issue is related to the virtual machine's USB device emulation not working correctly, so the category falls under 'peripherals'.

**Answer: peripherals**
