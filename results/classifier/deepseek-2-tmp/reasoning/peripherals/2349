Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. Let me read the details carefully.

The problem is that the keyboard and mouse aren't working in a macOS guest after exiting the EFI environment. They work in the OpenCore boot picker but not in the recovery system. The user mentioned that the mouse works if they force the PS2 controller and pause/resume the VM, referencing a specific GitHub issue. They tried adding PS2 kexts but QEMU's USB devices aren't attaching to the AppleUSBEHCI bus. It only works on Snow Leopard.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about keyboard and mouse not functioning correctly in a macOS guest. Since these are input devices, it's related to how QEMU handles peripherals. The fact that USB devices aren't attaching suggests a problem with device enumeration or driver interaction within the VM. This points towards a peripherals-related bug because it's specifically about hardware devices (keyboard, mouse) not working as expected.

I don't think it's a boot issue because the problem occurs after exiting EFI. It's also not graphic, network, socket, or hypervisor related. The mention of PS2 and USB suggests it's about device handling within QEMU. Therefore, the appropriate category is peripherals.
