Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through the report carefully.

The user is using QEMU version 3.1.0-1 on Archlinux 64-bit. They're experiencing issues with the mouse not working when using evdev passthrough alongside virtio-vga or KVM. When they remove either virtio-vga or KVM, the mouse works fine.

Looking at the command lines provided, the problematic one includes both `-accel kvm` and `-device virtio-vga`. The second example without these devices works as expected for the mouse.

The issue is specific to the mouse when using evdev passthrough with either virtio-vga or KVM. The keyboard works fine in all cases, so it's not a general input problem but mouse-specific.

Now, considering the categories: The bug relates to device passthrough, specifically mouse input, which falls under peripherals. It's not related to translation errors, assembly issues, performance, network, etc. Device passthrough is typically handled by how QEMU manages devices and their resources, so it fits into the 'peripherals' category.

The issue involves mouse input not working with evdev passthrough when using virtio-vga or KVM. Since this relates to device handling and input/output peripherals in QEMU, the correct category is:

**peripherals**
