Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "usb-audio does not work with Mac OS". The possible categories are quite a few, including things like mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and others.

First, I'll break down the bug report. It's about USB audio not working on Mac OS. So, the issue is related to hardware devices, specifically a USB device (audio), not functioning correctly in QEMU when used with macOS.

QEMU is an emulator and virtualization software that can emulate various hardware. Since it's dealing with USB audio, which is a peripheral device, this falls under the category of peripherals. The other options like network or graphic don't seem to fit because the problem isn't about networking or display issues. It's specifically about the USB audio device not working.

I should also consider if it could be related to KVM or hypervisor, but those are more about virtualization management rather than specific hardware devices. Similarly, 'device' is a broader category, but since USB audio is a peripheral, 'peripherals' might be more precise here.

Looking at the list again, 'peripherals' seems to be the most accurate category for an issue with a specific device like USB audio not functioning properly.

The bug report mentions that USB audio isn't working on macOS. Since USB audio devices are peripherals and this is about them not functioning correctly in QEMU, the appropriate category is peripherals.

**Answer:** peripherals
