Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU. The user mentioned that eMMC support is missing as a storage type. Let me think through this.

First, what categories are available? There's device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and others like assembly or mistranslation.

eMMC stands for embedded MultiMediaCard, which is a type of flash storage often used in devices like smartphones and memory cards. In the context of QEMU, this would relate to how the emulator handles storage devices.

Looking at the bug report, it's about missing support for eMMC as a storage type. The user provided some links to past discussions in qemu-devel. These seem to be patches or RFCs related to adding eMMC support. For example, one is from 2011 and another recent attempt in 2023.

So, the issue is about hardware emulation, specifically for storage devices. Since eMMC is a type of storage peripheral, this falls under the peripherals category. The other options like network or socket don't fit because those relate to communication protocols, not storage. Device might be a possible category too, but 'peripherals' seems more specific here.

Therefore, the bug report should be categorized as 'peripherals'.
