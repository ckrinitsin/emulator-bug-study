Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned a problem with the mouse cursor being invisible when using QEMU. They specified they're using an Ubuntu live system and provided details about how they booted it using KVM.

Looking at the categories, I see "mouse" isn't listed, but "peripherals" is close since a mouse is a peripheral device. Alternatively, could it be related to graphics? Maybe not directly, because the issue is with the cursor rather than rendering. Another option is "device," which might be too vague.

Wait, the bug report involves the mouse cursor specifically, so it's likely under peripherals as that's more about input devices. However, I remember that in QEMU, problems with hardware like mice are often categorized under device or maybe even KVM specifics since they're related to virtualization of hardware. But KVM is more about hypervisor aspects, not the individual device behavior.

Hmm, perhaps "peripherals" is the best fit here because it's an input device issue within the VM. Alternatively, if it's a graphical display problem with cursor rendering, it might fall under "graphic." But since the cursor isn't showing up at all, maybe it's more about device interaction. So I'm leaning towards "peripherals."

The bug report describes an issue where the mouse cursor is invisible when using QEMU with an Ubuntu live system. This suggests a problem with how the mouse (a peripheral device) is being handled by QEMU. The issue isn't related to translation, assembly lowering, or other non-device-specific areas. It's specifically about the behavior of a hardware device within the virtual machine.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Identify the Problem:** The cursor not showing up indicates an input device (mouse) issue.
2. **Categorize the Area:** Since it's related to hardware interaction, "peripherals" is appropriate.
3. **Exclude Other Categories:** It doesn't fall under assembly, network, or hypervisor directly.

**Answer:**
peripherals
