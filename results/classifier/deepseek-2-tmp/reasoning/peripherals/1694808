Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through the problem again.

The user is reporting that a USB host keyboard isn't working on Q35 platform during boot-up in QEMU-KVM. They used a specific command line with "-M q35" and when they remove it, switching to i440FX, the keyboard works. The issue seems related to how the Q35 platform handles USB devices.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem is about a USB keyboard not working during boot-up. USB is a peripheral device, so it falls under 'peripherals'. The Q35 platform is known for better hardware support, including USB, but if the keyboard isn't recognized at boot, it's likely an issue with how devices are handled in that platform configuration.

Other categories don't fit as well: it's not about translation errors, assembly issues, or network. It's specifically a hardware device (USB) problem on a specific platform, so 'peripherals' seems the best fit.

The bug report involves a USB device (keyboard) not functioning correctly during boot-up on a specific QEMU platform. This is related to hardware device handling, making 'peripherals' the appropriate category.

**Answer: peripherals**
