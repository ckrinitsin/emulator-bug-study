Alright, I'm looking at this bug report for QEMU where the system exits when using floating point instructions on a Cortex-M4 and an IRQ occurs. The user mentioned that CPACR.CP10 and CPACR.CP11 are set correctly, but NSACR isn't a register in Cortex-M4. 

First, I need to classify this bug into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is happening during emulation of a Cortex-M4 processor. The problem arises when a floating-point instruction is executed and then an IRQ occurs, leading to QEMU exiting with specific error messages related to SecureFaults and exceptions. Since this involves the interaction between the CPU core (Cortex-M4) and the handling of IRQs, it seems to be a hardware emulation issue rather than something purely in user-mode or assembly lowering.

The tags include 'cpu', 'irq', and 'cortex-m4', which points towards a device-related problem. The cortex-m4 is part of the peripherals being emulated by QEMU, so this likely falls under the 'peripherals' category.
