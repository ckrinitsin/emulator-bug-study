Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "European keyboard PC-105 deadkey." Let me break it down.

The user mentioned a "deadkey" issue with a European keyboard model PC-105. A dead key usually refers to a key that doesn't produce the correct character when pressed. In the context of QEMU, which is a hypervisor used for emulation and virtualization, this likely relates to how input devices are emulated.

Looking at the categories provided: assembly, device, graphic, network, etc. "Device" seems relevant because it's about hardware input (keyboard) not functioning correctly in the VM. Peripheral might also be considered since keyboards are peripherals. However, 'device' is a more general category that could encompass this issue better.

I think the best fit here is "device."
