Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "crashing when trying to read data from sensor through USB." The categories provided are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the issue is about reading data from a sensor via USB. Since it's related to USB devices and sensors connected through them, I should consider which category fits best.

Looking at the options, "peripherals" seems appropriate because USB devices are considered peripherals in computing. The bug involves hardware interaction, specifically with a sensor connected over USB, so it's not about translation errors or performance issues but rather device handling.

I don't think it falls under 'device' as that might be too broad, and 'peripherals' is more specific to external hardware like sensors and USB devices. Other categories like graphic or network aren't relevant here.
