Okay, let's see. The user is reporting a bug in QEMU where USB support isn't working for ARM devices like Raspi2 or Raspi3. They're using QEMU 2.12.0 on ArchLinux and tried adding a USB device with the command `-usb -device usb-host,bus=001,...`. But when they run it, QEMU gives an error saying "Bus '001' not found."

Hmm, so first, I need to classify this bug into one of the given categories. The options are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about USB not working in the emulation. USB support typically falls under hardware peripherals since it's dealing with devices connected to the system. In QEMU, peripherals usually refer to things like USB devices, serial ports, network adapters, etc. The user tried adding a USB host device but couldn't find the bus, which suggests that the USB subsystem isn't properly initialized or recognized in the ARM emulation.

Looking at the categories, 'peripherals' seems appropriate because it's about hardware devices (USB) not functioning correctly within the emulated environment. Mistranslation might be related to incorrect mapping in the code, but this seems more like a missing feature or configuration issue with USB support rather than a translation error. Device could also fit, but I think peripherals is more specific here.

So, the bug report is about the lack of USB support in the ARM emulation, which affects the ability to use USB devices within the emulated system. This points directly to a problem with how QEMU handles peripherals.
