Holding key down using input-linux freezes guest

Qemu release version 2.8.0
KVM, kernel 4.9.1

When using the -object input-linux capability in qemu for passthrough of input/evdev devices, I found that when a key is held for a few seconds or more (such as ctrl key), the guest system freezes until the key is released. In some cases, mouse control is also lost following one of these "freezes". I also noticed that one of the four cpu cores I have the guest pinned to ramps to 100% during these freezes.

Thought I might add:

The qemu command line option equivalents for mouse and keyboard:

-object input-linux,id=kbd,evdev=/dev/input/by-path/platform-i8042-serio-0-event-kbd,repeat=on,grab_all=on \
-object input-linux,id=ms1,evdev=/dev/input/by-id/usb-ROCCAT_ROCCAT_Kone_Pure-event-mouse

quick workaround: drop "repeat=on".
some guests seem to have problems with that, not debugged yet why.

I have tried without "repeat=on" option, and with 2.8.0 I still seem to be getting weird behavior with mouse dropping out at points, and with keys seemingly being continued to be pressed (ie still running around in an fps game after releasing the key). I also experienced at one point l-ctrl+r-ctrl not passing keyboard control to guest, and needed to VNC in to shutdown/restart guest (this was after plugging in a usb xbox360 controller, not sure if related).

I am getting the same issue where I can even hear the sound glitch out. I'm on Arch Linux.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
