Improve UX for macOS when launching from a fullscreen app

System/setup:
* MacBook Pro, macOS (any version from the last 2 years), external monitor.
* IDE on the laptop, emulator is used on the external monitor.

Currently, when starting the emulator from e.g. Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA, which is set to fullscreen mode on the laptop, which is like it's own virtual desktop (Space) in macOS, what happens is this:

1. The virtual desktop (Space) on the laptop screen is switched because of #2. The reason is that only one window can be shown in Fullscreen this way.
2. The qemu splashscreen is shown for a few seconds, then it disappears. This is the reason for the virtual desktop switch. This splashscreen seems actually unnecessary to me, it has no value and it causes problems.
3. The actual emulator is shown, in my case on the external monitor (correctly). I guess if the splashscreen would not be shown, the virtual desktop switch would not happen, because the emulator would happen on the correct screen directly.

So maybe the splashscreen and the emulator window should be the same window, so that the OS can remember it's position being the same as the emulator?
Or maybe the splash could be disabled (by default? otherwise an update to IDEs would be necessary for the improved behavior?)

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
