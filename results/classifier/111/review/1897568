Strange keyboard behaviour in Vim editor


I'm running MS-DOS 7.10 in a QEMU virtual machine, and there is a problem with the keyboard in the Vim editor.  The arrow keys jump over a line, as if you had typed the key twice.  PgUp and PgDn are likewise affected.  Other applications are not affected, unless you shell out from Vim.

The QEMU version is 5.0.0, and I'm using the "-k sv" option, but I've tried without it and it doesn't make a difference.

I don't get this keyboard behaviour in the exact same VM under VMware Player or Bochs.

-Albert.

The patch mentioned by Philippe has now been merged to the QEMU master branch (commit d1e45668d2128b064). Albert, could you maybe check the current git version to see whether this problem has been fixed now (using "-global i8042.kbd-throttle=on" to enable this new feature)?

Hi,

thanks for letting me know.

I do plan to test this and report back, but that may take some time, as I
would first have to compile and install a new version of QEMU.

Can someone explain why the patch keeps the incorrect behaviour as the default? It’s silly.

Felix, if you want to discuss the default behaviour, please get in touch with the author of the patch, since he might not read this bug tracker here.
Anyway, the patch has been released with QEMU 6.1, so I'm closing this ticket here now.
