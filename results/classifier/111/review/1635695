ovmf + smp + hyper-v + windows 7: doesn't work

- using ovmf
- enable smp (>1 processors/cores)
- enable hyper-v features (eg. -cpu Haswell,hv_time,hv_relaxed,hv_vapic,hv_spinlocks=0x1fff)
- try to boot or install windows 7 x64

Result: black screen and hangs

Sigh, the Windows bug that keeps on giving. And, users avoiding libvirt and sticking with the QEMU command line, despite the fact that using libvirt & its tools would save them from this bug.

Anyway, this report is a duplicate of <https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1593605>; please read that one for the background. Closing this one as invalid (just like the other one). Thanks.
