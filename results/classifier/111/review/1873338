Dos on the fly CD image replacement is not Working with DOS

Im not able to exchange CD image on the fly (needed for some games). I messed with command like - in console(ATL+CRTL+2) eject ide1-cd0 and change ide-cd0 D:/Games/!Emulators/Dos-QEMU/ISOs/TestChangeISO.iso , but system so never able to find new CD data.. simply drive so empty.. but when i reboot virtual machine, new change image is now working.

  Qemu 4.2.

Does this work with other guests, like Windows 95/98 as far as you can tell? Is it only a problem in DOS? What exact version of DOS are you seeing the problem with?

I tried Win98 virtual machine here its working fine, without reboot.

 Im using MS-DOS 7.1 - integrated within and Win9x and classic MSDEX or SHSUCDX drivers for CD-ROM, but o dpmt thing that it matters.

I think I need a bit more detail, I'm sorry. Can you explain to me the full environment you are seeing the problem in?

Host: Windows? Linux? what version? If Linux, what kernel version?
Guest: what's the version of the guest you are running? Windows98, or a version of DOS directly?
Command-line: What's the QEMU command line you used? An exact command line helps.

If it works OK in Windows98 but you are using a version of DOS embedded in Windows98, can you describe exactly the circumstance in which you are seeing stale CDROM data, with steps on how to reproduce?

When it "doesn't work", can you explain the exact behavior you are seeing, in which application(s)?



Host: I tried both Windows (10 64bit 19.09) and Linux host (Mint 19.3 64bit, kernel 5.40) system it really doesnt matters.

Guest: Windows 98 - has integrated MS-DOS 7.1 you can boot into it through boot menu, which could be set by meditation of MSDOS.SYS, but you can install MS-DOS 7.1 Standalone too, without Windows, its the same.

 What DOS is after set up through Autoexec.bat and config.sys files. 
 Using DOS 7.1 make sense, because its most modern and supporting FAT32 file system.

 There is Qemu starting line i doubt that it will help, you can simulate problem with any DOS machine.
qemu-system-i386.exe ^
-m 64 ^
-hda HDDs\MS-DOS-Systen-5G.vmdk ^
-hdb HDDs\DosData20G.vmdk ^
-vga cirrus ^ 
-soundhw sb16,adlib,pcspk ^
-net nic,model=rtl8139 ^
-net tap,ifname=TAP ^
-cdrom Isos\dos71cd.iso ^
-k en-us

 With Windows 98 - i run just commands in monitor.. open my computer and open cd drive - content of cd is changed.. its the same as in all later OSes XP- to Win10. Its working as expected.

 DOS - i boot into dos with cd drive driver enabled (lest say MSCDEX).. i run monitor, change cd image.. a trying to access it lets say that is drive E.. So i write "E:" <ENTER> to command line. I get error that drive is not accessible.. (command line should be switched to E:\ and here i should be able use "dir" to get list of files) but when i reboot machine, i see new exchange cd content.. so its at least somehow working.
  Problem is that some games and programs require change cd on the fly, so reboot is not solution.
  
   You can simulate right behavior with Vmware or Virtualbox machine.

   Is you are not familar with MS-DOS, here are command to autoexec and config for enable use of cd-rom drive:
https://superuser.com/questions/778716/install-a-cd-rom-driver-on-ms-dos

  Problem is probably that present version of cd exchange simulation code is not good enough / compatible for MSCDEX or SHSUCDX DOS CD-ROM drivers.. to make same action as is exchange cd on physical computer.

  Windows 98 and later are using other drivers for it of course..

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

Its not incomplete. i gave lots of info.

You need to reset the state from Incomplete to New after you've provided the information.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
