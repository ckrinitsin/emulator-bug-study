Segfault in audio_pcm_sw_write with audio over VNC

QEMU 5.0.0, built with ./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --enable-debug --disable-strip --disable-docs --disable-sdl

Running on a headless host (Ryzen 3600), Arch Linux, 64bit latest.
Guest is also Arch Linux, 64bit.

Started with qemu-system-x86_64 -vnc 0.0.0.0:0 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -cpu host -smp cores=2,threads=1,sockets=1 -machine q35 -vga std -device
 ich9-ahci,id=ahci -drive file=vm0.qcow2,format=qcow2,if=none,id=dsk0 -device ide-hd,drive=dsk0,bus=ahci.0 -soundhw hda

So, a headless VM is running on a server and is being connected to over VNC. The virtual sound card is detected and speaker test is running inside the VM. So far so good.

Then, i tell the VNC client to enable audio (QEMU Audio Client Message, 255,1,0). QEMU responds with a "stream is about to start" message (QEMU Audio Server Message, 255,1,1) and then promptly crashes without sending anything else.

Running it in GDB produces a crash at audio/audio.c:739

Thread 1 "qemu-system-x86" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
audio_pcm_sw_write (sw=0x5555575bbf30, buf=0x0, size=1628) at audio/audio.c:739
739             if (!sw->hw->pcm_ops->volume_out) {

The exact sequence of events does not matter - i can enable sound before playing anything, and then it would say nothing and keep working, but crash with the same message once anything sound-playing is launched in the VM.

Using different soundhw or adding various audiodev options does not seem to affect anything.

I can't quite figure out if the QEMU Audio VNC extension is supposed to work at all or not, but it would be handy to me if it is.

Great.
Can confirm, that patch fixes it.
