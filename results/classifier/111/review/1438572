kvm does not support KVM_CAP_USER_MEMORY Please upgrade to at least kernel 2.6.29 or recent kvm-kmod (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/kvm)

We have a machine which is having QEMU+KVM on below configuration of linux
uname -a
Linux cairotrior 2.6.18-308.13.1.el5 #1 SMP Thu Jul 26 05:45:09 EDT 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
cat /etc/issue
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.8 (Tikanga)
Kernel \r on an \m


But in another setup, we are trying on a different machine having RHEL 5.9 having higher kernel version but it still gives below error
kvm does not support KVM_CAP_USER_MEMORY Please upgrade to at least kernel 2.6.29 or recent kvm-kmod (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/kvm).
failed to initialize KVM: Invalid argument No accelerator found!


I don’t know if the qemu version have compatibility issues with redhat 5.9 version –  need someone to check if the qemu can run on redhat 5.9 64 bit or not ?

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

This error has never existed in QEMU, only in the old qemu-kvm fork which has been obsolete for about 5 years.  I'm closing this ticket.
