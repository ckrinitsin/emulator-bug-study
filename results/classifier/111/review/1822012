powernv machine complains of missing skiboot files

Hi, I want to use the powernv machine from the qemu-system-ppcle application. However, when I specify this machine, qemu complains that it can't find the skiboot files.

I noticed that skiboot is available for Ubuntu, but only for the PPC[64] hosts. Well, I just need skiboot files for qemu on amd64 hosts.

Hmm, looks like Debian has a package for these missing qemu files:

https://packages.debian.org/sid/qemu-skiboot

Could we promote these to Ubuntu repositories, and fix the qemu packages so that they automatically depend on the necessary BIOS packages? For example, openbios-ppc should also be installed when qemu-system-ppc[64[le]] are installed.

This sounds like a bug in the packaging of Ubuntu, so I've moved it to the Ubuntu tracker

skiboot.lid is available on all architectures as part of qemu-system-data package which is "all", not ppc specific.
The latter is pulled by the binary package qemu-system-ppc, so no particular action is needed.

Debian qemu-skiboot package was initially used to distribute skiboot.lid but it was soon after
replaced by qemu-system-data. At the moment qemu-skiboot is virtual in debian and it is provided
by qemu-system-data.

I tested powernv emulation on focal with that default setup and following this documentation:
https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/ppc/powernv.html
and I didn't encounter missing skiboot.lid issues.

Next time please provide logs, details about your ubuntu version and packages versions.

F.

Thank you for your bug report, and thanks Frédéric for the initial triage.

I agree with Frédéric's findings here: the skiboot file is properly installed in a Focal system by qemu-system-data.  Also, as he mentioned, qemu-skiboot is a virtual package; it doesn't really provide anything.

I am marking this bug as Incomplete because we were unable to reproduce the issue.  Moreover, I would like to reinforce Frédéric's request here and ask that you please provide more details, like what exactly you're trying to do, the commands you're using, the output you're seeing, etc.

Thanks.

As Frederick said (he did the change - thanks!) this is fixed for a while now.
In particular:

1401 qemu (1:4.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium                                          
...                 
1406   [ Frédéric Bonnard ]                                                           
1407   * Enable powernv emulation with skiboot firmware 

Which in terms of Ubuntu releases translates to >=Focal
