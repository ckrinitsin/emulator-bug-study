install Centos7 or fedora27 on qemu on windows8.1

Hello,
I have tried to install CentOs or Fedora27 on my Windows8 using QEMU. I work on notepad with 4GB.
Unfortunatly, my touchpad nor my usb-mouse are not recognise on the graphical installation of CentOs and Fedora installation. So, I cannot install them.
Here are the commands I use for installation :

qemu-img create -f qcow2 fedora27b2_hd.qcow2 80G

qemu-system-x86_64 -k fr -hda fedora27b2_hd.qcow2 -cdrom Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-27_Beta-1.5.iso -m 512 -boot d

I have tried to add the option : -device usb-mouse  but, I got the error message that no 'usb-bus' found for the usb-mouse device.

What is wrong ?  QEMU or my installation command ?

Thank, BRgds,
Laurent

Which version of QEMU are you using? Did you compile QEMU on your own or are you using a pre-build binary?
Anyway, to be able to use USB devices, you've got to specify the "-usb" parameter when starting QEMU.

I use qemu-w64-setup-20170830.exe on Windows8-64bits
I tried the following command, but it is very, very slow :

qemu-img create centos7_hd.img 80G

qemu-system-x86_64 -k fr -cpu core2duo -m 1024 -usb -device usb-mouse -hda centos7_hd.img --drive media=cdrom,file=CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso,readonly

BRgds,
Laurent


So I assume the mouse is working now? I think we then can close this ticket.
Concerning the speed: QEMU is emulating the CPU by default, so this is of course slower than running everything natively. You've got to use an accelerator to get more speed - for Windows, you can use HAXM: https://www.qemu.org/2017/11/22/haxm-usage-windows/

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
