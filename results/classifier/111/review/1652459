kvm rbd driver (and maybe others, i.e. qcow2, qed and so on)  does not report DISCARD-ZERO flag

# lsblk -D
NAME   DISC-ALN DISC-GRAN DISC-MAX DISC-ZERO
sda           0        4K       1G         0
├─sda1        0        4K       1G         0
├─sda2     1024        4K       1G         0
└─sda5        0        4K       1G         0


Last column should be `1` at least for "RBD+discard=unmap" since reading from discarded regions in RBD MUST return zeroes. The same with QCOW2, QED and sparse raw images. KVM should copy value of this flag when real raw device (i.e. real SSD) with discard capability is used as virtual disk.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
