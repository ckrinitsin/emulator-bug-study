Not working turkish q keyboard

Ç pres result,
. Press. Result ç


I meant which version of QEMU is still working for you? Which version fails?

What does "localectl" print (both host and guest please)?

  after v20171217 all versions.


What does v20171217 refer to? A pre-built binary? Windows? Linux? Mac OS? ... sorry, but you have to be a little bit more specific.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
