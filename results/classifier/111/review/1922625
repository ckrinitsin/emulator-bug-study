qemu 5.2.0 configure script explodes when in read only directory

I extracted the qemu 5.2.0 source as one user, and then tried to run `./configure --help` in that directory as a different user. Normal autoconf configure scripts have no problem with this but yours goes into an infinite loop printing nonsense:

Using './build' as the directory for build output
mkdir: build: Permission denied
touch: build/auto-created-by-configure: No such file or directory
./configure: line 37: GNUmakefile: Permission denied
./configure: line 59: cd: build: No such file or directory
Using './build' as the directory for build output
mkdir: build: Permission denied
touch: build/auto-created-by-configure: No such file or directory
/path/to/qemu-5.2.0/configure: line 37: GNUmakefile: Permission denied
/path/to/qemu-5.2.0/configure: line 59: cd: build: No such file or directory

etc.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
