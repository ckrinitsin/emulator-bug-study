SLIRP SMB silently fails with MacOS smbd

When using the -net user,id=net0,ipv6=off,smb=/path/to/share/option,hostfwd=tcp::19500-:22 I can successfully mount_smbfs the shared directory on the guest when QEMU is running on a Linux or FreeBSD host. However, on a MacOS host the mount_smbfs command just fails with
`mount_smbfs: unable to open connection: syserr = Connection reset by peer`.
After some debugging it turns out this is because the smbd shipped by macos is incompatible and doesn't use the same config file/command line arguments.

I have since got it working by compiling the sources form samba.org and using the --smbd= configure option pointing to that binary.

Would it be possible to print a warning message or even better abort the launch saying smbd is incompatible with QEMU if the -smb= flag is passed? It appears that smbd should die with an error code on invalid arguments so QEMU should be able to report that.


This was happening with QEMU built from git sources at c1c2a435905ae76b159c573b0c0d6f095b45ebc6.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
