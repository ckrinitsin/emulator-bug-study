qemu-img converts large vhd files into only approx. 127GB raw file causing the VM to crash

I have a VHD file for Windows 2014 server OS. I use the following command to convert VHD file (20GB) to a RAW file for KVM.

qemu-img convert -f vpc -O raw WIN-SNRGCQV6O3O.VHD disk.img

The output file is about 127GB. When install the VM and boot it up, the OS crashes with STOP error after the intial screen. I found on the internet that the file limit of 127GB is an existing bug. Kindly fix the problem. The workaround to use a Hyper-V to convert to fixed disk is not a feasible solution.

Which version of QEMU (or rather qemu-img) have you been using here? Can you still reproduce it with the latest version (currently v2.12)?

I have qemu-img 1.4.1 included in Suse Linux Enterprise server version 11 SP3. I will see whether I can update it and then try the conversion and post the results. 

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
