qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped

steps to reproduce:
pbuilder-dist utopic armhf create
pbuilder-dist utopic armhf login
apt-get install imagemagick
convert foo.xpm foo.png
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
Segmentation fault

(doesn't matter if images are actually there or not)

I'm running into this same problem, and it's making automation of Raspberry Pi builds of my application difficult.

I'm running in a chroot environment:
3.19.0-25-generic #26~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 24 21:16:20 UTC 2015 armv7l GNU/Linux

Package: qemu
Version: 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u11

This may or may not be relevant here, but the mysterious "uncaught target signal 11" error was fixed for maas images (lp:maas-images) build process by increasing the memory to the VMs that were doing the build.  We had been doing the cross/qemu-static building in ~512M vms and that was resulting in somewhat transient failures during 'apt-get update'.  Upping the memory of the vm to 2G made those go away.


Status changed to 'Confirmed' because the bug affects multiple users.

Thanks Thomas for assigning to Ubuntu's Qemu which is correct in this case.
I know there are still issues reported by Locutus to look into, but this one seems expired.

I don't want to appear randomly closing bugs, so I verified with something "old" which today would be Trusty. So there I ran.

$ pbuilder-dist trusty armhf create
$ pbuilder-dist trusty armhf login
$ apt-get install imagemagick
$ convert foo.xpm foo.png (file not there)
$ convert ./share/pixmaps/display.im6.xpm ./share/pixmaps/display.im6.png (Trusty)
$ convert ./share/pixmaps/display-im6.q16.xpm ./share/pixmaps/display-im6.q16.png (Artful)

All working, so closing this old bug as invalid now.

Hi, I am getting the error:

qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
Segmentation fault

When I try to execute a Hello World binary on my amd64 machine, with Hello World built by mips-linux-gnu-g++, using either mips binfmt extensions (./hello) or qemu-mips-static hello. I have libstdc++6:mips installed as well. My source code is as follows:

#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
    return 0;
}

Worth noting that this problem only happens with mips cross runs. mips64el and mipsel work just fine.

I happen to be doing this in Debian 10.0.0 Buster stable amd64 on VirtualBox on Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo amd64, but it looks like the same behavior on native Ubuntu hosts as well. I tried increasing guest RAM to 1GiB and 2GiB, with no affect on the runtime error message. Is there a glitch in one of the mips packages?

@mcandre, I think your issue, even though it's also a segfault, is a different one than this bug from 2014, which was about armhf and was verified in comment #4 as no longer happening.

Could you please open a separate bug about what you experienced, including detailed steps to reproduce it? Attaching the core file would also help.

Thanks!
