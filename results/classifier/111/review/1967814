Ubuntu 20.04.3 - ilzlnx3g1 - virtio-scsi devs on KVM guest having miscompares on disktests when there is a failed path.

== Comment: #63 - Halil Pasic <email address hidden> - 2022-03-28 17:33:34 ==
I'm pretty confident I've figured out what is going on. 

From the guest side, the decision whether the SCSI command was completed successfully or not comes down to looking at the sense data. Prior to commit
a108557bbf ("scsi: inline sg_io_sense_from_errno() into the callers."), we don't
build sense data as a response to seeing a host status presented by the host SCSI stack (e.g. kernel).

Thus when the kernel tells us that  a given SCSI command did not get completed via
SCSI_HOST_TRANSPORT_DISRUPTED or SCSI_HOST_NO_LUN, we end up  fooling the guest into believing that the command completed successfully.

The guest kernel, and especially virtio and multipath are at no fault (AFAIU). Given these facts, it isn't all that surprising, that we end up with corruptions.

All we have to do is do backports for QEMU (when necessary). I didn't investigate vhost-scsi -- my guess is, that it ain't affected.

How do we want to handle the back-ports?

== Comment: #66 - Halil Pasic <email address hidden> - 2022-04-04 05:36:33 ==
This is a proposed backport containing 7 patches in mbox format. I tried to pick patches sanely, and all I had to do was basically resolving merge conflicts.

I have to admit I have no extensive experience in doing such invasive backports, and my knowledge of the QEMU SCSI stack is very limited. I would be happy if the Ubuntu folks would have a good look at this, and if possible improve on it.

    scsi: inline sg_io_sense_from_errno() into the callers.

Thereby indeed this is only for Focal.
Sorry, but analyzing the details will take more time...

I can confirm that just on the patch-level only two need backporting, the rest applies as is and I have regenerated them to match the packaging requirements. The backport-adaptations themselves are minimal.

From the content I guess it is complex enough that nobody can be fully sure.
I'm still reading it ...

Until then a few questions:
- I wonder if we'd also want/need dc293f6 "scsi: fix sense code for EREMOTEIO" (to ensure this kind of ioerror gets to the guest as well) - what do you think?
- I also wondered about 424740d "scsi-disk: do not complete requests early for rerror/werror=ignore" but we do not have 40dce4ee applied so that should be ok

I'm done reading and while a complex subsystem and a bunch of changes they individually all seem sane to me (although a108557b could have side effects that are hard to spot).

For SRU considerations I think this includes potential change of behavior of formerly silently ignored errors now becoming visible (or with more detail) to the guest. But IMHO silently hiding I/O errors is asking for problems and data corruption (just as you've found it=, while reporting them is correct.

I'll later build a PPA for your testing  as you seem to have a testcase with Disktest on your side that can reproduce the issue that made you aware.

Prepared
PPA: https://launchpad.net/~paelzer/+archive/ubuntu/lp-1967814-scsi-error-handling/+packages
MP: https://code.launchpad.net/~paelzer/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+git/qemu/+merge/418636

Let us see if one builds and tests fine and the other gets positive review feedback.

I have nothing against including those. I was under the impression that a minimal fix is desired, and my tests indicate that dose patches are not strictly necessary.

Generally I think that those are good patches, and having them is better than not having them. But then I hope most of the patches are good patches, and obviously backporting all the good patches is not very practicable -- hence the principle of minimality.

It is just my two cents. My understanding of SCSI is quite poor.

You are right for a general stance of SRU minimality

But this case felt like fixing 7/8 of a single whole.
And while indeed your case didn't need this one more fix someone else would and we touch this code anyway. Vice versa all tests since this is upstream is done with it applied - so the coverage of the code with this added is better than without - so we also avoid unexpected side effects.
OTOH We would not fix something totally else like something in virtio as part of this, no matter how reasonable that patch might look like.

Let me know if you had time to push the PPA through your testing.

Pulled the PPA

root@ilzlnx3:~# apt info qemu
Package: qemu
Version: 1:4.2-3ubuntu6.22~focalppa1

I triggered a path failure from the host and saw the faulty paths on the guest but no data miscompares (first time I've ever seen it not having miscompares at the first try).
Recovered and tried again, this time I did got the miscompares, I captured the DBGINFO and sosreport, let me know if something else is needed.

That is very bad news! :(

I was not able to trigger the problem with the patched qemu. I will try harder, but if I can't trigger the problem it becomes very difficult for me to work on it.

Maybe we are hitting a different case. Maybe not. In the past we used to observe multiple types of miscompares one of which is the all zero, and another one is wrong but still  disktest data.

I'm curious if we see the wrong disktest data type of miscompare with the patched qemu.

Also I would like to know if the miscompare is still observable after a reboot (i.e. if you destroy and re-start the guest, and then do a manual compare with disktest on the given block (without the write phase).

Also can I help you install a self-built upstream qemu so we can test with that as well? Maybe we are just missing some more patches.

Thanks Vanessa for the testing on the PPA!

@Halil - I'd leave the debugging of the remaining issue to you as while you can't reproduce it yet it still is much closer to you than it is to me :-/ Thanks in advance, let us know what you find.

In the meantime I have prepared the SRU content and got a PR review, so once we are convinced it is good - or found what we need to change - we should be ready to continue.

I was not testing the PPA you provided properly, I pulled it again and made sure it was installed and running:

root@ilzlnx3:~# /usr/bin/qemu-system-s390x --version
QEMU emulator version 4.2.1 (Debian 1:4.2-3ubuntu6.22~focalppa1)

I ran the error injects for a few hours and no miscompares were encountered.
Thanks @Halil, for bringing the issue to my attention!

@Ubuntu: I think we can and should move forward with this. The problem with the
previous test results is, that the qemu from the PPA wasn't installed at all, and thus we ended up just verifying that the old one is still broken.

I read Vanessas comment like, she the issue is not observed any more with the PPA installed: i.e. the fix works at least for the test-case that used to trigger the problem reliably. @Vanessa: Please correct me if I'm wrong.

That is correct, the fix works, no miscompares while doing the test-case I've been using to reproduce this issue (tested for a few hours, no more than 30 seconds in between error injects).

Following up on some older bugs...
Okay, that means the PPA version of qemu for focal could be successfully verified (no miss-compares).
So I'll change the status back to In Progress ...

Thanks for the pre-check.
Everything is ready and now uploaded to Focal, there please verify it on the real build once accepted by the SRU team.

Hello bugproxy, or anyone else affected,

Accepted qemu into focal-proposed. The package will build now and be available at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/1:4.2-3ubuntu6.22 in a few hours, and then in the -proposed repository.

Please help us by testing this new package.  See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed for documentation on how to enable and use -proposed.  Your feedback will aid us getting this update out to other Ubuntu users.

If this package fixes the bug for you, please add a comment to this bug, mentioning the version of the package you tested, what testing has been performed on the package and change the tag from verification-needed-focal to verification-done-focal. If it does not fix the bug for you, please add a comment stating that, and change the tag to verification-failed-focal. In either case, without details of your testing we will not be able to proceed.

Further information regarding the verification process can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/PerformingSRUVerification .  Thank you in advance for helping!

N.B. The updated package will be released to -updates after the bug(s) fixed by this package have been verified and the package has been in -proposed for a minimum of 7 days.

I've accepted this, and I agree that this is a good candidate for testing in proposed for longer than 7 days; I'll do so after at least 14 days, so double the normal soak time.

All autopkgtests for the newly accepted qemu (1:4.2-3ubuntu6.22) for focal have finished running.
The following regressions have been reported in tests triggered by the package:

ubuntu-image/1.11+20.04ubuntu1 (amd64)


Please visit the excuses page listed below and investigate the failures, proceeding afterwards as per the StableReleaseUpdates policy regarding autopkgtest regressions [1].
