Windows guest virtual PC running abnormally slow

Guest systems running Windows 10 in a virtualized environment run unacceptably slow, with no option in Boxes to offer the virtual machine more (or less) cores from my physical CPU.

Any news or fixes?

Which command line parameters are passed to QEMU? Is your system able to use KVM (e.g. did you enable virtualization support in your BIOS)?

I am constantly running Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 and I don't experience specific slowdowns.

QEMU command line is needed to understand the specific setup that might be problematic.

If you don't provide the CLI parameters, there's no way we can help here, sorry. So marking this as "invalid" for the QEMU project.

Windows installs are still acting abnormally slow on the latest Gnome Boxes flatpaks in Ubuntu 18.10.
I'll try to get my CLI parameters and add it to the bug.

Sorry if this sounds dumb, where do I find my CLI Parameters for my Windows VM?

Jeb, if you open a bug against QEMU here, we expect some information how QEMU is run. If you only interact with Gnome Boxes, then please only open a bug against Boxes - best in their Bug tracker here: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/ ... I guess nobody of the Boxes project is checking Launchpad, so reporting Boxes bugs here in Launchpad does not make much sense.

At least please try to answer my questions in comment #3: Is virtualization enabled in your BIOS? Is KVM enabled on your system (i.e. are the kvm.ko and kvm_intel.ko or kvm_amd.ko modules loaded)?

And for the CLI parameters, you could run this in a console window for example, after starting your guest:

ps aux | grep qemu
