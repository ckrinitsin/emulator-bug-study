loadvm makes Windows 7 x86 guest crash with some CPUs

Running qemu with kvm enabled and -cpu set to some of the more "modern" CPUs,
and having Windows 7 x86 as the guest.

After guest OS loads, start some app (I started "cmd"), then do "savevm".
After that, do some more activity (I closed cmd window and opened IE),
then do "loadvm" of the previously saved snapshot.

loadvm shows briefly the state that the system was in at the snapshot time,
then guest OS crashes (blue screen).

Originally I saw this problem on qemu 1.4.0,
then I also tried qemu 2.5.0 and found the same problem.

The CPUs that I tried were mostly those that support NX bit (core2duo, 
qemu64, kvm64, Nehalem, etc.)

If I use the default CPU, or some other like qemu32/kvm32,
the problem does not occur.

What is your host processor?

it is Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1410 0 @ 2.80GHz


Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
