I've been successfully running 2 Windows 2003 32-Bit Standard Edition Servers on this server for over a month now. Both were migrations from actual physical servers. However, I've continued to receive random crashes on a Windows 2003 64-bit standard edition running terminal services, which was a fresh install. The server runs fine for hours under a decent load (20 users) and then will crash with a 3B bug check code (System_Service_Exception). I opened a ticket with Microsoft and submitted multiple memory dumps and their engineers suggested the following:

Dump Analyses Result:
===================

What happened is that the OS initiated an APIC /software interrupt. This is handled by the APIC in real hardware. In your Virtual Environment case where you are using Linux based VM – Proxmox, the VM implementation somehow has to make it happen on a virtual machine with the same latency in the virtual APIC. The problem is that there is a latency between when it was initiated and when it happened.


Below are the details for understanding the process or concept of APIC interrupts:

What the Local APIC Is
The Local APIC (LAPIC) is a circuit that is part of the CPU chip. It contains these basic elements:
A mechanism for generating
1. interrupts
2. A mechanism for accepting interrupts
3. A timer

If you have a multiprocessor system, the APIC's are wired together so they can communicate. So the LAPIC on CPU 0 can communicate with the LAPIC on CPU 1, etc.


What the IO APIC Is

This is a separate chip that is wired to the Local APIC's so it can forward interrupts on to the CPU chips. It is programmed similar to the 8259's but has more flexibility.
It is wired to the same bus as the Local APIC's so it can communicate with them.

Note:- In our scenario, it’s all Virtualized interrupts or calls because of hypervisor in picture and thus we need to contact the VM application vendor to get a check of this latency issue in APIC interrupt.

Their engineers are saying that there is a latency issue with APIC. I'm not exactly sure how this can be corrected. Is this a known issue and is their a solution to this problem. I love Proxmox, but my main reason for using it was to upgrade my terminal server to better hardware, while leveraging it for other virtual machines as well.  The forum administrator for Proxmox, suggested I bring this issue to your attention.

Since there hasn't been an answer to this within the last years, it looks like nobody here knows about Proxmox problems. So let's close this ticket...
