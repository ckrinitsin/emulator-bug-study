Regression: SIGSEGV running Java

I have a build script that bootstraps a Debian armhf image. Part of the process involves running a Java program while inside a chroot. I am using Debian's qemu-user-static package to run the armhf Java binary on an amd64 system.

qemu-user-static version 1:2.7+dfsg-3~bpo8+2 works fine. Version 1:2.8+dfsg-1~bpo8+1 always causes Java to crash with a SIGSEGV. The location of the crash appears to be random and hasn't been the same twice.

I am using the Azul Systems Zulu Embedded Java runtime, rather than the regular OpenJDK runtime, because the Zulu runtime has an arm32 JIT whereas OpenJDK is interpreter-only on arm32.

I can reproduce the problem easily by mounting the image created by my build script and executing "java -XshowSettings -version" in a chroot. I can give you the image if that would help debug the problem.

Additional investigation reveals the problem has something to do with the Azul ARM32 JIT. If I run Java with -Xint to force interpreter-only mode, this problem doesn't occur.

Similar issue reported in two other places on the net:

https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static/issues/18 "qemu-arm-static 2.8 and Java+Maven setup not working"

https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3259#c4 Bug 3259 - Javac fails within qemu-aarch64-static chroot on x86

fyi, similar seen for Raspbian9:

Hi -- I believe we fixed the Java crashes as part of work done for the 2.12 release (and perhaps 3.0, I forget). Does this still reproduce with the most recent release of QEMU (eg the 4.0 release candidate) ?
