qemu-i386 32-bit segfault

I'm getting segfaults on 32-bit linux trying to run binaries using qemu-i386 from git. These segfaults go away when run in gdb or strace - could it be about the environment somehow?

In contrast qemu-x86_64 works fine. How can I pinpoint the cause of this? 

Thanks!

It seems this crash only happens in xterm (and not normal console). 

Having compared the respective environment vars the culprit turned out to be:

TERM=xterm-color

You're welcome.


Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
