QEMU does not build with vte v2.91

when I build qemu with vte support and vte-2.91 installed I get the following deprecation warning:

error: ‘vte_terminal_set_encoding’ is deprecated [-Werror=deprecated-declarations]
     vte_terminal_set_encoding(VTE_TERMINAL(vc->vte.terminal), "UTF-8", NULL);
     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In file included from /usr/include/vte-2.91/vte/vte.h:35

I looked for the commit in vte that deprecated the offending function (a17e714d), which led me to the thread:

https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/issues/3

It looks like from this version forward vte forces us to use utf-8, such that this function call becomes unnecessary in QEMU.

Hi Bastian,

I got past this error by installing libvte-dev instead of libvte-2.91-dev.

I'm not sure if it actually works however.

Hi Berg,

thanks for the tip, a fix has also been commited already :)

Cheers,
Bastian
