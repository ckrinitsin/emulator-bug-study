Deadlock on Windows 10 pop-up

I was able to install and can log in but whenever a pop-up is attempted the VM appears to deadlock.
I can still kill -9 the process and recover but the VM and the QEmu console both hang with no error output.

At first I thought it was UAC but renaming a file causes a pop-up and that also deadlocks.
I rebuilt QEmu 2.6.0 with debug info and did a thread back-trace once the deadlock occurs.
See the attachment for the trace.

I am attempting to setup GPU pass-thru with a GTX 970 but this deadlock occurs with -vga std (and no GPU pass-thru) as well.

(I cannot install or start Windows 7 but I am told this is a known bug.)



Removing the soundhw hda device prevents the deadlock.

Below was my QEmu start-up command-line:

qemu-system-x86_64 \
-enable-kvm \
-m 8192 \
-drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly,file=./ovmf-x64/OVMF-pure-efi.fd \
-drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=./OVMF-pure-efi-Win10.fd \
-drive file=/dev/Stuff/Windows10,format=raw,if=virtio,cache=none \
-drive file=virtio-win.iso,id=virtiocd,if=none,format=raw -device ide-cd,bus=ide.1,drive=virtiocd \
-device vfio-pci,host=01:00.0,addr=09.0,multifunction=on,x-vga=on \
-device vfio-pci,host=01:00.1,addr=09.1 \
-usb -usbdevice host:003.006 \
-cpu core2duo,+nx,kvm=off \
-vga none \
-soundhw hda



The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has be

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
