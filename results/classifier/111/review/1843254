arm emulation of HCR.TID3 traps are not implemented

On ARM (aarch64), HCR_EL2.TID3 [bit18] is supposed to trap ID group 3, which includes the ID_AA64{PFR,DFR,ISAR,MMFR,AFR}*_EL1 registers. However, setting that HCR bit has no effect and accesses to those ID registers are not trapped to EL2 with an EC syndrome value of 0x18.

Yes, we don't currently implement most of the 'trap system register access' bits in HCR_EL2. Last time I checked we were missing TID0 TID1 TID2 TID3 TIDCP TAC TSW TPC TPU TTLB TVM TRVM TDZ, but it's possible we've implemented one or two of those since then.


TID3 trapping should be mostly fixed for 4.2 -- we will trap accesses to all the coprocessor/sysreg ID registers that TID3 covers. Trapping of aarch32 MVFR* (which are accessed via vmrs) will not make it into this release, but should be in 5.0.


The last bit of TID3 trapping is now in QEMU git master and will be in 5.0.
