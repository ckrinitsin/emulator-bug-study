command.com on win95 throws video mode out

on a presumed-good copy of Windows 95 obtained from http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1960870, the operating system boots successfully and shows up fine, but as soon as I double-click the MS-DOS icon, the window, while remaining the same size, goes to a different resolution and only shows a small portion of what it did, with strange colors and artifacts. tried first with the Debian 2.5 package, then with latest cvs sources, then with the 2.5.0 release, all the same problem.

jcomeau@aspire:/usr/src/qemu-2.5.0/build$ cd /tmp/win95/SDL/
jcomeau@aspire:/tmp/win95/SDL$ /usr/src/qemu-2.5.0/build/i386-softmmu/qemu-system-i386 c.img 
jcomeau@aspire:/tmp/win95/SDL$ /usr/src/qemu-2.5.0/build/i386-softmmu/qemu-system-i386 --version
QEMU emulator version 2.5.0, Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard



verified that the problem does not exist on bochs version 2.6-5 Debian package. I first had to convert the image from qcow to raw: qemu-img convert -O raw c.img c_raw.img

bxrc file:

megs: 32
vga: extension=vbe
romimage: file=$BXSHARE/BIOS-bochs-latest
vgaromimage: file=$BXSHARE/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest

#info: action=report
#debug: action=report
log: /tmp/bochs-win95.log
mouse: enabled=0

command line: bochs -q -f /tmp/bochs.bxrc

screenshot attached.

Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU?
