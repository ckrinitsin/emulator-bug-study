"semtimedop" implementation missing in qemu?

I was trying to do an ARMv6 cross compile with qemu-user-static when I ran into this:

https://travis-ci.com/github/VDR4Arch/vdr4arch/jobs/326884620#L1596

I was close to giving up when I found the following:

https://github.com/osrf/multiarch-docker-image-generation/issues/36

Most important comment may be this one:

> The "correct" way to fix this does seem to be to implement semtimedop in qemu.

I don't know how much involved the people, discussing there, are in the qemu development but I thought it may be a good idea to bring this to your attention. If this is already fixed (I haven't found any bug about "semtimedop"), then please just close this one and tell me in which version the fix will be included.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
