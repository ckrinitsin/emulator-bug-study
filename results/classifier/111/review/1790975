Default arm virt machine broken

This occurs on qemu_v3.0.0 but not on qemu_v2.12.2 (built from qemu_v3.0.0 tag on github)

Symptom: You'll see something like this in the kernel output:

[    1.285210] OF: PCI: host bridge /pcie@10000000 ranges:

Qemu Command Line: qemu-system-arm -machine virt -m 1024M -kernel zImage -serial stdio

I can post my zImage if anyone has problems reproducing with their own zImage.

Oh, I forgot, I should have also posted the relevant DTS contents:

I tried to triage this a bit today.

I'm running a 32-bit linux kernel and I think that's the problem.  The ECAM address base is at 0x4010000000, but it gets truncated to 0x10000000 because it's only a 32-bit kernel, but since it's truncated, it conflicts with VIRT_PCIE_MMIO (see hw/arm/virt.c) whose range is from 0x10000000 to 0x3efeffff which matches what we see in the error message.

Hi Jonathan,

I sent an email yesterday on the qemu ML. 

"
Please can you try using
qemu-system-arm -machine virt,highmem=off -m 1024M -kernel zImage
-serial stdio

Does your guest support LPAE? This may be the cause.

Thanks

Eric

LPAE is actually disabled in my kernel config.  Knowing the cause now, I can see that qemu would not be able to detect this problem.  This error should have been detected in the linux kernel with an indication that the ECAM window was using a 40-bit address but LPAE was not enabled.
