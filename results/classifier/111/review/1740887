qemu-system-arm & qemu-system-aarch64 for windows crash at start

In Windows 7 64 bit (both 32 & 64 bit QEMU emulator version 2.11.0 (v2.11.0-11693-g21057c841e-dirty)).

With arguments:

qemu-system-arm.exe -M raspi2

It crashes and reports:

ERROR:/home/stefan/src/qemu/repo.or.cz/qemu/ar7/qom/object.c:176:type_get_parent: assertion failed: (type->parent_type != NULL)

Same goes for qemu-system-aarch64.exe or with -M raspi argument.

Have a nice day,
f.

I've got th exact same crash under Windows 10 64 bits with QEMU emulator version 2.10.95 (v2.11.0-rc5-11692-g50cdacc703-dirty)

Any idea how to fix it or is there a previous known working version for "-M raspi" option?

Thanks.
RaphaÃ«l.

I had to switch back to the following installer "2016-03-03: New QEMU installers. Fixed, first version with support for Raspberry Pi 1 and 2." for having a working version with the "-M raspi" option.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
