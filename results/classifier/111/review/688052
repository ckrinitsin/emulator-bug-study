usb does not work 0.13.0

Hi all, I'm using both, debian lenny and debian squeeze.
I installed qemu-kvm (0.12.5) form debian repository but I got problem trying to pass a host usb device to the guest.

I compiled so the latest stable version (0.13.0) hoping that the problem was fixed.
It didn't help, the error I get is always:

usb_create: no bus specified, using "usb.0" for "usb-host" 

The command I use is

qemu-system-x86_64 -hda lenny_amd64_vergine.qcow2 -usbdevice host:002.007 -boot order=c

On internet I found this, it might help:

The guest is a simple debian lenny with 2.6.26 kernel.


I tried also to download the qemu development version but the download get interruped

git clone http://git.qemu.org/qemu.git
Cloning into qemu...
error: Failed connect to git.qemu.org:80; No such file or directory (curl_result = 7, http_code = 0, sha1 = 62d76a25fe741bdaf1157f0edaf50a7772541db6)
error: Unable to find 62d76a25fe741bdaf1157f0edaf50a7772541db6 under http://git.qemu.org/qemu.git

I attach more info about the host machine I'm testing on.



Thanks for the report.

For the second part, you need to clone using the git protocol (git clone git://git.qemu.org/qemu.git
as shown in http://wiki.qemu.org/Download#Latest_Source_Code). The http bit appears broken for now.

I'm not sure about the first part yet - certainly trying a more recent release would be useful to know.

the correct syntax is
-usb -device usb-host,vendorid=x,productid=y

at leats on my app-emulation/qemu-kvm-1.0-r2

QEMU 0.13.0 is quite outdated - and I assume that USB passthrough should be working fine with the latest version, so I'm closing this bug ticket now. If you still have problems with the latest version of QEMU, feel free to open it again (or create a new bug ticket instead).
