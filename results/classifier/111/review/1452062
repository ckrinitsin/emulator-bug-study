qemu-img will fail to convert images in 2.3.0

Hello guys,

    There seems to be a bug in qemu-img with 2.3.0 that wasn't there in 2.2.1  .... qemu convert will always fail converting.  See the output below:

I can't reproduce this.  qemu-img convert works just fine here.

qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 -c -o compat=0.10 x.img y.img

(from a random winXP guest image).

The only possibly relevant change I can see in 2.3 is that the qcow2 driver added an additional error check to a truncate operation. Can you please run qemu-img under strace -f and either provide the output as an attachment or paste the relevant failing call(s) if you can recognise them?

I rolled back QEMU to 2.2.1 and it succeeded converting the image ...   I'll try to see if I can re-upgrade QEMU without breaking again the CI we have here.

This problem is fixed with commit 3e5feb62 ("qcow2: Handle EAGAIN returned from update_refcount"), which will be included in qemu 2.4.0.
