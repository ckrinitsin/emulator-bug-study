Illegal Instruction with HVF when encountering SSE instructions in the emulator

The latest version of QEMU doesn't seem to support emulated SSE instructions with HVF acceleration on macOS.
The decoder will treat SSE instructions as invalid, get the instruction sizes wrong and quickly crash the guest OS because of illegal instructions.
After having a quick look at target/i386/hvf/x86_decode.c, it seems that SSE instruction emulation isn't implemented in the current version of the x86 emulator.

A way to reproduce the issue is to run a macOS 10.13 guest with HVF acceleration enabled, this will crash once it's loading up the GUI.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Thomas, I think the issue is there. SSE/MMX weren't yet added for HVF.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
