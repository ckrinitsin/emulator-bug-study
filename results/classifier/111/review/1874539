tulip driver broken in v5.0.0-rc4

In a qemu-system-hppa system, qemu release v5.0.0-rc, the tulip nic driver is broken.
The tulip nic is detected, even getting DHCP info does work.
But when trying to download bigger files via network, the tulip driver gets stuck.

For example when trying to download a 100MB file:

root@debian:~# wget https://speed.hetzner.de/100MB.bin
--2020-04-23 20:26:43--  https://speed.hetzner.de/100MB.bin
Resolving speed.hetzner.de (speed.hetzner.de)... 88.198.248.254, 2a01:4f8:0:59ed::2
Connecting to speed.hetzner.de (speed.hetzner.de)|88.198.248.254|:443... connected.
<waiting and stuck here>

When reverting this commit, everything works again:

PATCH: net: tulip: check frame size and r/w data length

Commit 8ffb7265af does make the code safer, but broke the device model.
Instead of setting the error bits when the frame length is incorrect (too big), it simply discards it. The guest is not notified of the error and keeps waiting.

Attached trivial patch fixes it.
