qemu-system crashes when use sheepdog driver

Already solved.



why this bug is Invalid?
U can view my upload file and qemu/block/sheepdog.c differences.

Sorry, but if I read a bug description that says "already solved", without any proper description how you ran qemu, which version you were using, etc., then the bug ticket does not make much sense.
So please provide a proper description, and if you've already got a fix, send a patch (diff!) to the qemu-devel mailing list instead of attaching a .c file to the bug tracker. See http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch for details. Thanks.

Have you ever sent a patch to the qemu-devel mailing list?
