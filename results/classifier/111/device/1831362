European keyboard PC-105 deadkey

With a freshly compiled version of qemu 4.0.50 on Windows 10 (host)

I am using 3 different Belgian keyboards and I have the same behaviour
- 2 USB keyboards (Logitech and HP) and
- the keyboard of my laptop (HP)

3 characters on the same key cannot be used (the key seams to be dead):
< (less than),
> (greater than) used with the combination of LShift or RShift
\ (backslash) used with the combination of AltGr

Using grub command mode from an archlinux installation (5.1.4)
The keyboard seams to be a mix of azerty and qwerty keyboard
all letters are correctly mapped but all numbers and special
characters are not

Using sendkey in monitor
"sendkey <" results in : \
"sendkey shift-<" results in : |
"sendkey ctrl-alt-<" results in : nothing

REM: VirtualBox can handle this key and with the showkey command
     from the archlinux kbd package, it shows :
     keycode 86 press
     keycode 86 release


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
