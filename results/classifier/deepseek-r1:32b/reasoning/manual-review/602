Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The issue is about translating host error numbers to target error numbers in IP_RECVERR and IPV6_RECVERR control messages. The user mentioned that `ee_errno` isn't translated, leading to mismatches between host (like x86_64) and guest (e.g., MIPS) systems. For example, ECONNREFUSED is 111 on the host but should be 146 on MIPS.

Looking at the provided code snippet, it seems they're adjusting how error numbers are handled in system calls. The fix involves translating the errno using `host_to_target_errno`. 

Now, considering the categories: 'instruction' would relate to specific CPU instructions or assembly issues. This doesn't seem related since it's about error handling in syscalls. 'Runtime' could involve general runtime errors but isn't specific enough here. The problem is specifically with system calls and their error translations, so 'syscall' seems appropriate.

Thus, the category should be 'syscall'.

The bug report deals with translating error numbers in system call messages, which falls under system call handling.
