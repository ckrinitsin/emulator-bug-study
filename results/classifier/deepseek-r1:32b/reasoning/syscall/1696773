Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user provided a program that starts a goroutine and calls exec repeatedly. It works fine natively but crashes under ARM user emulation with a segfault or other failures.

First, let me understand what's happening here. Golang uses goroutines, which are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. When they call exec repeatedly in a goroutine, it's probably making a lot of system calls. 

Under normal circumstances, this works because the host OS can handle these syscalls efficiently. But when running under QEMU's user emulation for ARM, something goes wrong. The crashes are segfaults or other issues.

I need to figure out what category this bug falls into: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Since it's happening during system calls (exec), it might be related to how QEMU handles these syscalls in emulation mode. Maybe there's an issue with how the ARM emulation is translating or executing certain syscalls, leading to crashes.

So, I think this relates to a problem with system calls under user emulation. Therefore, the category should be 'syscall'.
