Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Let me read through the problem description and the provided information carefully.

The issue is about here-documents in bash producing an ENOENT error after updating gnulib and coreutils. The user's script uses `cat <<EOF` which should redirect from a here-document to stdin for cat. But instead, it's failing with "No such file or directory".

Looking at the strace outputs:

In the updated system, the process calls newfstatat on fd 0 (which is connected to a deleted tmp file), resulting in ENOENT. The error message from cat indicates that it can't find the file '-'.

In contrast, the old system uses fstat and successfully reads from the same tmp file without errors.

The key difference seems to be the use of newfstatat versus fstat. From my understanding, newfstatat is a more modern syscall that allows specifying flags like AT_EMPTY_PATH. It might behave differently in how it handles certain paths or file descriptors compared to fstat.

Since the problem arises from a change in system calls (from fstat to newfstatat), which leads to different behavior and an error, this seems related to how the kernel or system calls are handling the situation. The ENOENT occurs because newfstatat can't find the file descriptor as expected, possibly due to changes in how it's implemented.

So, this issue is about a discrepancy between two syscalls (fstat and newfstatat) leading to an error in functionality. Therefore, it falls under a syscall-related problem.
