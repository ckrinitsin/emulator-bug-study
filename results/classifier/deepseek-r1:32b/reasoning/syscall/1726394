Okay, so I need to classify this bug report as either 'instruction', 'syscall', or 'runtime'. Let's read through it carefully.

The problem is about QEMU-user passing through a prctl system call with specific arguments: PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, and an address. The third argument is causing an EFAULT because it points to a BPF filter that's architecture-specific. Since the address can't be rewritten due to architecture differences, the safest action is to return an error.

The user isn't sure whether to return EINVAL or something else but wants an identifiable error so seccomp errors can be ignored if not supported.

Hmm, prctl is a system call used to set process flags and parameters. The issue here seems to stem from how QEMU handles this specific sysctl call. So the problem is related to handling a system call incorrectly, leading to an EFAULT when trying to access memory at the given address.

So, since it's about how the system call (prctl) is being handled or passed through, causing an error, the category should be 'syscall'. It doesn't involve faulty instructions in the guest code, nor is it a general runtime issue; it's specifically about handling a syscall incorrectly.

The bug report discusses issues with handling the prctl system call, specifically how QEMU passes arguments leading to an EFAULT. This is related to system call processing.
