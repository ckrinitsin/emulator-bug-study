Alright, I need to figure out what category this bug report falls into. The user mentioned they added a new syscall (number 436) to QEMU but received ENOSYS from their MIPS application. They provided details about modifying `cpu_loop.c` by adding an entry for `sys_getdents64_x32`. 

They also showed the code where `syscall_num` is calculated and checked against `sizeof(mips_syscall_args)`, which returns -TARGET_ENOSYS if it's out of bounds. The user noticed that the MIPS implementation differs from ARM, suggesting a need for refactoring to match how ARM handles syscalls with its own base.

The issue here is clearly related to handling system calls correctly in QEMU for MIPS. The problem arises when adding a new syscall, which isn't being recognized properly, leading to ENOSYS errors. This points to an error within the system call handling mechanism rather than an instruction or runtime error unrelated to syscalls.

So, this bug is about how the system calls are managed and processed in QEMU for MIPS architecture, hence it's a syscall-related issue.

The bug report discusses issues with adding a new syscall and receiving ENOSYS errors. It involves modifying `cpu_loop.c` and comparing it to ARM's implementation. The problem lies in handling syscalls, not instructions or runtime errors unrelated to syscalls.
