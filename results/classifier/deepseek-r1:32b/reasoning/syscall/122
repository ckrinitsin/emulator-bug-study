Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. The issue mentioned is "linux-user does not check PROT_EXEC". Let me break it down.

First, I remember that QEMU has different modes, including user mode emulation (linux-user) which allows running binaries from one OS on another. So the problem is in that part of QEMU.

The term PROT_EXEC refers to a memory protection flag used in syscalls like mmap or mprotect. It allows execution of code in that memory region. If linux-user isn't checking this, it might lead to security issues because it could allow executing unauthorized code.

Now, looking at the categories: instruction, syscall, runtime. This issue is about how QEMU handles PROT_EXEC in user mode. It's more about how the emulation interacts with system calls and memory protections rather than a specific instruction or runtime error elsewhere.

So, the problem relates to syscalls and how they're handled. Therefore, it falls under 'syscall'.

The bug report pertains to the handling of PROT_EXEC within the linux-user mode of QEMU, which affects how system calls related to memory protection are managed.
