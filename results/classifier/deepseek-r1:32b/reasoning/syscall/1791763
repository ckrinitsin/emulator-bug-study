Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report about the Nios2 user-mode emulation in QEMU. Let me read through the problem again.

The issue is with signal handling not working properly. The user mentions that parts were copied from the Linux kernel but weren't adjusted for host and target data types or address spaces. Also, there's a problem with sigaltstack returning EINVAL because of incorrect struct order.

Looking at the categories: instruction, syscall, runtime.

This doesn't seem to be an issue with a specific instruction being faulty. It's more about how system calls are handled. The problems described are related to system calls like sigaltstack not working correctly because of structural issues in the code. So, it's likely a syscall category issue.
