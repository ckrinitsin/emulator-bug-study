Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user provided some output logs and mentioned that certain system calls like set_robust_list and clone are reported as unimplemented. They also linked to another bug about signal syscalls.

First, I'll look at the logs. It seems there are multiple lines showing that set_robust_list is returning an error (errno 38), which means it's not implemented. Similarly, clone is mentioned but perhaps in a different context. The user notes that these issues were reported separately under a QEMU bug.

Now, considering the categories given: instruction, syscall, runtime. 

- Instruction would involve issues with specific CPU instructions.
- Syscall relates to system call errors.
- Runtime covers other runtime errors not related to instructions or syscalls.

In this case, the issue is about certain system calls (set_robust_list and clone) being unimplemented, which means they're not handled correctly by QEMU. So these are syscall-related problems because they involve the interaction between user-space programs and the kernel through system calls.

Therefore, the category should be 'syscall'.

The bug report involves errors with specific system calls (set_robust_list and clone) being unimplemented in QEMU, indicating issues related to system call handling.

**Answer:** syscall
