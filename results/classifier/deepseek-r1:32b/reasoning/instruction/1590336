Alright, I'm looking at this bug report about QEMU not rejecting certain ARM instructions on non-V8 CPUs. The user provided an example where vrintz is executed instead of being rejected on a Cortex-A9 processor. They also included objdump and qemu output showing the instruction being processed.

The categories to consider are instruction, syscall, or runtime errors. Since the issue is about handling specific ARM instructions incorrectly, it falls under the 'instruction' category.
