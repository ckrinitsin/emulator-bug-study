Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user mentioned that when they try to execute code built with AVX2 instructions using QEMU's x86-64 user mode with a Skylake CPU setting, it hangs at 100% CPU usage. They also provided some warnings about TCG not supporting certain features like AVX and other SIMD-related instructions.

Looking at the output, I see that there are several warnings from QEMU indicating that TCG (the Translation Core) doesn't support specific CPUID features. These include things like FMA, PCID, X2APIC, and most importantly, AVX and AVX2. The code in question is using AVX instructions, which the trace shows as vsubsd and vcvttsd2si.

The stacktrace from GDB points to functions related to softfloat operations, specifically within the FPU handling of QEMU. It seems that when processing these AVX instructions, the emulator gets stuck because it doesn't have proper support for them in TCG mode.

So, considering the categories provided: instruction, syscall, runtime. The issue is directly related to how the emulator handles specific instructions (AVX), which aren't supported by TCG. Therefore, this falls under the 'instruction' category.

The problem arises because QEMU's TCG doesn't support AVX instructions, causing it to hang when encountering them.
