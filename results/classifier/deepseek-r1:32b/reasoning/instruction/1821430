Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report about qemu-user-arm crashing. Let me read through the details again carefully.

The user mentioned that they're using qemu-user-arm version 4.0.0-rc0 for crosscompilation via a wrapper. They noticed that it crashes with SIGILL on two specific instructions. 

In the first case, the instruction is "vseleq.f64 d0, d17, d0". The second case involves "vrintm.f64 d18, d18". Both of these are ARM NEON instructions, I believe.

They also noted that the same binaries run without issues with qemu-user-arm 3.1.0, whether from Ubuntu or self-built. So it seems like a regression introduced in version 4.0.0-rc0.

Looking at the possible categories: instruction, syscall, runtime. The bug is about specific ARM instructions causing crashes. It doesn't mention any system calls failing, and it's specifically related to how certain instructions are handled during execution.

So, since the crash is happening because of an illegal instruction (SIGILL) when executing these two NEON instructions, this falls under the 'instruction' category. The issue likely stems from a problem in the emulation of these particular ARM instructions in QEMU.

The bug report describes crashes due to specific ARM instructions not being handled correctly by qemu-user-arm 4.0.0-rc0. This is classified as an instruction-related issue.
