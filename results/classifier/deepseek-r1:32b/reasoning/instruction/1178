Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report related to QEMU and RISC-V64's `feq.s` instruction. The user is asking if `feq.s` only considers the lowest 32 bits.

First, I know that in RISC-V, `feq.s` is a single-precision floating-point comparison instruction. It compares two single-precision values and returns true if they are equal. Since it's single-precision, it should work with 32-bit floats.

Now, the user is mentioning RISC-V64, which typically deals with 64-bit registers. However, when using `feq.s`, even in a 64-bit environment, it operates on the lower 32 bits of the source registers. So any issue here would relate to how the instruction processes these bits.

Looking at the categories provided: instruction, syscall, runtime. The problem described seems to be about how an instruction (`feq.s`) is handling data (the lowest 32 bits), which falls under an instruction-level bug. It's not related to system calls or runtime errors elsewhere in the program.

So, I think this should be categorized as "instruction."

The issue pertains to how the `feq.s` instruction handles 32-bit values within a 64-bit architecture. This is an instruction-related bug.

**Answer:** instruction
