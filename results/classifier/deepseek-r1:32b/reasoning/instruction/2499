Okay, so I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user provided a description about an issue where certain instructions (fsave and frestore) aren't being handled correctly on specific CPUs. 

First, let me understand the problem. The user says that valid code for 68020/68030 uses fsave/frestore with external FPU units like 68881 or 68882. But QEMU only allows these instructions on 68040 and others get an exception. So the issue is that certain CPUs aren't handling these FPU instructions properly.

Looking at the provided code, the change seems to adjust how features are checked in the translation process. The original code checks for M68K_FEATURE_M68040, but the user suggests changing it to check for M68K_FEATURE_FPU instead. This makes sense because whether fsave/frestore is allowed should depend on having an FPU, not just being a 68040.

Now, classifying this bug: It's about how instructions are handled. The issue arises when specific instructions (fsave and frestore) cause exceptions incorrectly. So it's related to the processing of these instructions in QEMU.

Considering the categories provided:
- Instruction: Faulty handling of an instruction.
- Syscall: Error with system calls.
- Runtime: Other runtime errors.

This bug is about how certain instructions are being treated, specifically causing incorrect exceptions. Therefore, it falls under 'instruction' because it's directly related to the handling of specific CPU instructions.
