Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The problem is that some test programs using specific VSX instructions (vextractbm, vextracthm, vextractwm, vextractdm) fail on qemu-ppc64 but not on qemu-ppc64le.

First, I'll analyze the issue. These are vector extract instructions in PowerISA, used for extracting bits from a mask into a register. The tests work on little-endian (ppc64le) but fail on big-endian (ppc64). This suggests an endianness issue or something specific to how these instructions are handled in the emulator.

The user provides steps to reproduce using both a custom test and Google Highway's unit tests, which compiles and runs under QEMU. The problem occurs at runtime when executing these specific instructions, leading me to think it's related to how QEMU emulates these instructions on ppc64.

Looking at the possible categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The issue is not a system call error because it's about vector operations. It's also not a general runtime error unrelated to any particular operation but rather specific to certain instructions.

So, this seems like a problem with how QEMU handles these specific instructions on big-endian PowerPC64. Therefore, the bug falls under the "instruction" category because it involves incorrect handling of specific CPU instructions by the emulator.
