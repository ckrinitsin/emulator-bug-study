Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The user provided a detailed crash report from Fedora 36 involving an illegal instruction error when using flatpak. Let me break down what's happening here.

Looking at the stack trace, the program crashes in a function called `sha512_block_data_order_avx2` within `/lib64/libgnutls.so.30`. The disassembly shows that the problematic instruction is `vzeroupper` at address `0x7f89783cbe4a`. 

I remember that `vzeroupper` is an AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) instruction used to zero out the upper bits of YMM registers. This instruction is part of the x86-64 instruction set and is typically used when transitioning between scalar and vector operations to avoid undefined behavior.

The error occurs because the CPU doesn't recognize `vzeroupper` as a valid opcode, which suggests that either the CPU doesn't support AVX instructions or the code isn't checking for AVX support before using these instructions. Since the bug report mentions Fedora 36, it's possible that the system in question has an older CPU without AVX support.

So, the issue revolves around an instruction (`vzeroupper`) being executed on a system where it's not supported. This falls under the category of an invalid or faulty instruction. It's not related to a syscall error or a runtime issue like memory management; instead, it's about using an unsupported CPU instruction.

Therefore, I classify this bug as part of the "instruction" category.

The bug is caused by an invalid CPU instruction being executed on a system that doesn't support it, specifically `vzeroupper`. This falls under the category of an instruction-related issue.
