Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The issue says that when using CMake with qemu-alpha-user, it crashes due to an Illegal Instruction. 

First, I need to understand what each category means. The categories given are instruction, syscall, and runtime.

The "instruction" category would involve a problem with the actual machine instructions being executed. Like if there's a bad opcode or something that the CPU can't handle. 

The "syscall" category is about errors related to system calls. Maybe the program tried to make an invalid call to the OS, which caused it to crash.

Then there's "runtime", which is for other runtime errors not fitting into the first two categories. So things like memory issues, segmentation faults, etc., that happen while the program is running.

In this case, the error is an Illegal Instruction when CMake runs qemu-alpha-user. QEMU is a emulator, so maybe it's trying to execute some code that the host CPU doesn't support? Or perhaps there's a problem with how CMake is invoking it.

I'm leaning towards "instruction" because the error message mentions an illegal instruction, which suggests a problem with the instructions being executed. It could be that QEMU is generating or handling instructions in a way that's incompatible with the host architecture.

The crash occurs due to an Illegal Instruction, indicating an issue with executed machine code.
