Okay, I'm trying to figure out what's going on here. The user is having an issue where their program runs fine under GDB but crashes when run directly in QEMU. Specifically, they're getting a core dump because of a signal 5 (Trace/Breakpoint trap). 

Looking at the disassembly, there's a BKPT instruction at address 0xa608. I remember that BKPT is used for breakpoints and should generate a SIGTRAP when hit. But in QEMU's Linux-user mode for ARM 32-bit, this isn't handled correctly. The user mentioned they found a bug report indicating this was fixed, but it's still happening.

They provided the GDB session where stepping through the code lands on the BKPT instruction without crashing. However, when running outside of GDB, QEMU doesn't recognize the BKPT and triggers a SIGTRAP, leading to a core dump.

The backtrace shows that QEMU is processing pending signals, specifically signal 5 (SIGTRAP), which causes it to abort. This suggests that the issue lies in how QEMU handles the BKPT instruction when not under GDB's control.

So, this seems like an issue with how instructions are handled by QEMUâ€”specifically, the BKPT instruction isn't being translated into a SIGTRAP correctly in non-debugging scenarios.

The problem arises because QEMU doesn't properly convert the BKPT instruction into a SIGTRAP signal when not debugging. This is an issue related to handling instructions.
