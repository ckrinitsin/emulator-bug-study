Okay, I need to classify this bug report about Slirp not accepting non-local DNS servers into one of the given categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime.

Looking at the description, it says that Slirp doesn't allow a provided DNS address if it's outside the local network and suggests removing the check. The issue seems to be related to how Slirp handles DNS configuration during its operation, which happens while the software is running.

The problem isn't about an incorrect instruction in code or a syscall error; it's more about runtime behavior when handling DNS addresses. Therefore, this falls under 'runtime' errors.
