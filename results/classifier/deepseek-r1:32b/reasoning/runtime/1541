Okay, so I'm looking at this bug report about QEMU and Clang 15 having an issue with G_NORETURN. The problem occurs when building for MIPSEL or using a minimal example provided. 

The error message says that there's an attribute list appearing where it shouldn't. The code in question is using `extern G_NORETURN` before the function declaration. The user suggests swapping `extern` and `G_NORETURN` to fix it.

Hmm, I remember that in C++, certain attributes like `[[noreturn]]` can be applied to functions. But the placement of these attributes relative to other specifiers matters. In Clang 15, maybe they changed how they handle attribute placements or their order with other keywords.

Looking at the code snippet, when the user writes `extern G_NORETURN void qemu_build_not_reached_always(void);`, it's possible that Clang is interpreting this as an invalid position for the attribute. So, moving `G_NORETURN` after `extern` might resolve the syntax issue because the compiler expects certain keywords in a specific order.

I think the key here is understanding the correct placement of function attributes and specifiers in C++. According to the standard, attributes can appear before or after other specifiers, but maybe Clang 15 has stricter enforcement. Alternatively, perhaps `G_NORETURN` being a macro that expands to `[[noreturn]]` isn't compatible when placed before `extern`.

So, this seems like a compiler-specific issue where the order of keywords matters for parsing. The user's fix suggests that placing `extern` first and then the attribute works around the problem in Clang 15.

This bug is more about how the code interacts with the compiler during compilation rather than runtime behavior or system calls. It doesn't involve instructions execution or syscalls; it's a compile-time error due to syntax placement.

The issue arises from incorrect ordering of function specifiers and attributes in the source code when using Clang 15, leading to a compile-time error. Fixing the order resolves the problem.
