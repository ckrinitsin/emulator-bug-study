Okay, so I'm looking at this bug report about QEMU on macOS needing to have an embedded plist. The user is explaining that macOS applications typically use an Info.plist file within their bundle to set various properties like the bundle identifier. They mention that for command-line binaries, you can embed this plist into the binary itself using a linker flag.

The problem here seems to be that QEMU's executables don't have this embedded plist, which could cause issues with system features relying on it. The user suggests creating a plist file and embedding it during linking with `-sectcreate __TEXT __info_plist YourPlistFile.plist`. They also reference another issue (#334) where having the correct bundle identifier was important.

Now, I need to classify this bug report into one of the categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. 

Let me think about each category:

- **Instruction**: This would be if there's a problem with a specific CPU instruction causing issues.
- **Syscall**: If the issue is related to system calls (like open, read, etc.) not working correctly.
- **Runtime**: Other errors that occur while the program is running.

The bug here isn't about instructions or syscalls failing. It's more about the application setup and missing an embedded file that macOS expects. This affects how the system interacts with QEMU at runtime because without the plist, certain features won't work as intended. So, it's a runtime issue because it impacts the program's behavior while running on macOS.

Therefore, this bug falls under the **runtime** category.

The bug report discusses issues related to how QEMU executables are set up on macOS, specifically about embedding an Info.plist file. This affects system interactions and feature functionality when the binary runs. Thus, it is classified as a runtime issue.
