Alright, I'm looking at this bug report about an assertion failure in QEMU's arm_read_memory_func function. The user encountered the issue when running under target armeb-linux using qemu user mode with some debug flags. 

The problem arises when _dl_new_object calls strlen, which is implemented in Thumb2 mode (armv6t2). This leads to print_insn_arm() calling arm_read_memory_func(), and the assertion that info->endian == BFD_ENDIAN_LITTLE fails because it's actually big-endian.

The user mentions that removing the assert allows execution to continue without issues. They also note that with the assert in place, QEMU stalls, which is problematic.

Now, I need to classify this bug into one of the given categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. 

Looking at the issue, it's related to how memory is being read by the disassembler during instruction decoding. The assertion is about endianness, which affects how bytes are interpreted. Since Thumb2 instructions can be 16-bit or 32-bit, the way they're read depends on endianness.

The problem occurs during runtime execution when handling Thumb2 mode, so it's an issue that happens while the program is running, not necessarily due to a faulty instruction or a syscall error. Therefore, it falls under a runtime error.
