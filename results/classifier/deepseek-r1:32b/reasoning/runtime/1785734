Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. 

Looking at the description, the issue involves a movdqu instruction causing a partial write across a page boundary when executed in TCG mode. The test shows that when such an instruction is attempted, it results in a page fault and partially writes to memory before handling the fault.

The problem seems to stem from how the emulator handles this specific instruction's execution, particularly at a page boundary where a page fault occurs. It's related to the processing of the instruction during runtime rather than any system call or an issue with instructions themselves. The runtime environment is not correctly managing the partial write scenario caused by the movdqu instruction.

So, this bug is about how QEMU handles the execution of this instruction at a low level during runtime, leading to unexpected memory writes.
