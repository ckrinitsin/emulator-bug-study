Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user is reporting regressions when running GCC tests on QEMU targeting an ARM CPU (cortex-a9). The tests used to pass but now cause QEMU to crash with a signal 6 (Aborted), resulting in a core dump.

Looking at the possible categories:

- **Instruction**: This would involve issues with specific instructions causing problems. There's no mention here of any particular instruction failing or being miscompiled.
  
- **Syscall**: If the issue was related to system calls, I might expect more details about which syscalls are problematic. The report doesn't specify any syscall errors.

- **Runtime**: This category covers general runtime issues that aren't tied to specific instructions or syscalls. The crash occurs during test execution, and it's a recent regression in QEMU, affecting multiple tests. Since the problem happens at runtime without pointing to a specific instruction or syscall, this seems like a runtime error.

So, I think the bug falls under **runtime** errors.
