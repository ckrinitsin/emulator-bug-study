Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The report mentions "ARM user regression since 87b74e8b6edd287ea2160caa0ebea725fa8f1ca1." 

First, I should understand what each category entails. 

- **Instruction**: This would involve issues with specific CPU instructions not working correctly.
- **Syscall**: Problems related to system calls made by the guest OS through QEMU.
- **Runtime**: Errors that occur during execution but aren't tied to a specific instruction or syscall.

The bug report doesn't mention any specific instruction failing, so it's probably not about an individual instruction. It also doesn't talk about system calls going wrong. Instead, it mentions a regression in the ARM user mode, which suggests something is going wrong when running ARM code in user mode under QEMU. 

This seems like a general runtime issue because it affects how the emulator runs ARM processes without pointing to specific syscalls or instructions. Therefore, the category is likely "runtime."
