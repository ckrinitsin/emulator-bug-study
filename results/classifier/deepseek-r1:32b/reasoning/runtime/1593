Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU's SLIRP hostfwd feature ignoring the bind address and using INADDR_ANY instead. Let me think through what each category means.

First, the user described that when they specify a hostfwd with a particular IP (like 127.0.0.1), QEMU ends up listening on all interfaces, which is a security issue because it might expose the guest more than intended. The problem seems to be in how SLIRP handles the bind address.

Looking at the possible categories:

- **Instruction:** This would be if there was an incorrect instruction given or processed. But here, the user provided the correct syntax but QEMU didn't respect it, so it's not about processing instructions wrong.

- **Syscall:** If the issue were with a system call error, like a failed bind(), that might fit. However, the problem is more about using INADDR_ANY regardless of input, which isn't a syscall failure but rather incorrect behavior in handling configuration.

- **Runtime:** This refers to errors happening during runtime, such as logic errors or misconfigurations. Since QEMU is supposed to use the specified bind address but doesn't, this seems like a runtime error because it's about how the program behaves when running.

So the issue isn't with an instruction or a syscall failure; it's that during runtime, QEMU doesn't respect the user-defined bind address and instead uses INADDR_ANY. Therefore, the category should be "runtime".
