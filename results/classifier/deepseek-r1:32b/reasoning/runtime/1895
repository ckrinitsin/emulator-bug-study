Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report as part of QEMU. The user mentioned that when using qemu-user (specifically for riscv64), compiling a source file with g++ results in a segmentation fault, which doesn't happen on real hardware. 

Looking at the steps provided, they set up an Arch Linux riscv64 container using qemu-user and then try to compile a reduced test case. The error is a segmentation fault from g++, pointing to cc1plus crashing. They've already determined it's not a g++ bug since it doesn't reproduce on real hardware.

The user also provided some context that qemu-user uses a fixed stack size and ignores RLIMIT_STACK requests, which can cause issues with programs that need more stack space than allocated. This makes me think the problem is related to memory management during program execution in the emulator.

Now, considering the categories: instruction, syscall, runtime. 

- **Instruction** would be if there's a specific CPU instruction causing the issue. But here, it's about stack size, not an individual instruction.
  
- **Syscall** relates to system calls failing. The problem isn't with a particular syscall but rather with how resources (stack) are managed.

- **Runtime** covers errors that happen during program execution, such as memory issues. Since the segmentation fault is due to insufficient stack space, it's a runtime error specific to qemu-user's handling of stack limits.

So, putting it all together, this seems like a runtime issue because it's about how the emulator manages resources during program execution.
