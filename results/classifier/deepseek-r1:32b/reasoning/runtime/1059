Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this QEMU issue that's happening on macOS when using Docker. The problem is that when someone tries to run a Docker image that uses QEMU internally, they're getting an error message: "qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped." 

First, I need to understand what each category means. The categories are instruction, syscall, and runtime. Let me break them down:

1. **Instruction**: This would involve a problem with the instructions given, like incorrect commands or steps in the installation process.
2. **Syscall**: This refers to issues related to system calls, which are how programs interact with the operating system kernel. Errors here could be permissions issues or problems accessing certain OS features.
3. **Runtime**: These are errors that occur during the execution of a program, not necessarily due to instructions or syscalls but perhaps bugs in the software itself.

Looking at the problem description: The user is installing BotFront locally on macOS using Docker and encountering this QEMU issue. They followed steps from the documentation, so it's likely not an instruction error unless there are specific steps that aren't handled well on macOS. 

The error message mentions a signal 6 (Aborted), which typically indicates that the program received an abort signal, often due to a runtime error like division by zero or accessing invalid memory. Since QEMU is involved and it's running inside Docker on macOS, there might be some compatibility issues with how QEMU interacts with the host system.

QEMU can sometimes have problems when running on virtualized environments or specific OS setups. On macOS, Docker runs within a virtual machine (like the one provided by Docker Desktop), so QEMU might be having trouble with nested virtualization or resource allocation. This could lead to runtime errors because the environment isn't handling the resources as expected.

I don't see any mention of incorrect commands in the steps, so it's probably not an instruction issue. It also doesn't seem directly related to a specific system call failing unless QEMU is making a problematic syscall on macOS. However, since it's a signal 6 (abort), it's more likely that the problem arises during runtime execution.

So, putting this together, I think the classification would be **runtime**, as the issue seems to occur during the execution of QEMU within Docker on macOS.
