Okay, I need to figure out what category this bug falls into. The user provided a detailed report about their RISC-V project running on QEMU where the code behaves differently based on whether a certain snippet is inside a function or directly in main.

First, looking at the problem description: when they run the same code within a function, it works fine, but when placed directly in main, it hangs. This suggests that the issue might be related to how variables are handled or memory usage, perhaps stack overflows or something similar.

The user tested without optimizations and using malloc instead of FreeRTOS's allocator, but no success. The problem doesn't seem to involve syscalls since the code is minimal and doesn't use RTOS features beyond the setup.

They also mentioned QEMU environment issues, which could point towards a runtime error rather than something in the toolchain or user-space code. Since the issue occurs at runtime when running on QEMU, it's likely related to how QEMU handles certain instructions or states during execution.

Possible categories are instruction, syscall, or runtime. Since no specific instruction is faulty and no syscalls are involved, it points towards a runtime error in QEMU.
