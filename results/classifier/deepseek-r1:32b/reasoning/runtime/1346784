Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what category this QEMU bug falls into. The issue is that internal memory areas of QEMU are visible to the guest when it reads /proc/self/maps. That means the guest can see parts of QEMU's memory which shouldn't be exposed.

Looking at the provided information, the user ran a test program with ASan and used QEMU's -R option because the binary couldn't run otherwise. The memory map shows both valid and invalid regions marked. The problem is that some areas marked as valid (like QEMU's own heap) are being reported to the guest.

The category options are instruction, syscall, or runtime. Instruction issues involve faulty CPU instructions. Syscall problems relate to system calls not working correctly. Runtime errors are other issues during execution.

This seems like a runtime issue because it's about how memory is managed and exposed during QEMU's operation. The problem isn't in an instruction or a specific system call but in the runtime environment where internal memory areas leak into the guest process's view.
