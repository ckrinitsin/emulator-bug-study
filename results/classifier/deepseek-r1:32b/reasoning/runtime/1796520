Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. The issue occurs when running "autogen --help" on qemu-sh4-user after a specific commit, resulting in an unhandled trap. The error message shows a trap 0x180 and various register states.

Looking at the commit details, it's about adding missing FPSCR.PR == 0 checks for frchg and fschg instructions. This suggests that without these checks, the code might be causing incorrect behavior when PR isn't zero.

The crash happens during runtime, so this is an execution issue rather than a problem with an instruction or syscall. Therefore, the category should be "runtime".
