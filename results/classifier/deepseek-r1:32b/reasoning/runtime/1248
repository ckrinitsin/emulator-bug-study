Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The problem is about glibc's wide-string functions like wcsbrk(), wcsspn(), and wcscspn() being broken under QEMU user emulation on s390x architecture. 

The description mentions that these functions are implemented in optimized assembler in glibc. Since the issue arises when running under QEMU, it suggests a problem with how the emulator handles certain instructions or operations related to these functions.

Looking at the categories:
- Instruction: This would relate to faulty processor instructions.
- Syscall: Issues with system calls.
- Runtime: Other runtime errors not falling into the above two.

The bug report doesn't specify issues with syscalls but points to problems with specific wide-string functions implemented in assembler. Since these are part of the runtime environment and involve assembly-level operations, it's more likely a runtime issue rather than a problem with instructions or system calls. The fact that the behavior isn't detected on real hardware implies it's an emulation-specific runtime error.
