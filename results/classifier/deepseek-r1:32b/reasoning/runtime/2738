Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Let me read through the problem description carefully. The issue is about Go 1.23 build hanging when running under qemu-user on an x86_64 host. 

The steps involve setting up qemu-user for a foreign architecture and then building a Docker image with podman specifying the arch as aarch64. From what I know, qemu-user is used to emulate other architectures without requiring full virtualization. It handles binary translation.

Now, considering the categories: instruction would relate to issues with specific CPU instructions. Syscall relates to system calls causing problems. Runtime involves general runtime errors outside of these.

In this case, since it's about building Go code under emulation and hanging, it might be related to how Go interacts with the emulated environment. Maybe something with signal handling or process management during compilation. This doesn't seem to be a problem with an instruction or a specific syscall but rather something happening in the runtime environment provided by qemu-user.

So I think the category is runtime.
