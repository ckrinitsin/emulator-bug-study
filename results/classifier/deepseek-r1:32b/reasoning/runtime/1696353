Okay, I need to classify this bug report about Go binaries failing under Linux-user in QEMU. The user provided an error log and mentioned that it's related to the Go runtime not passing the CLONE_SYSVMEM flag during clone calls on Linux.

First, looking at the error message: "runtime: failed to create new OS thread (have 2 already; errno=22)". This suggests a problem with creating new threads. The stack trace points to runtime.newosproc and mentions an issue in os_linux.go line 160. That file is part of Go's runtime, specifically handling OS-specific code for Linux.

The user also linked the Go source where clone flags are set. They noted that the CLONE_SYSVMEM flag isn't being passed, which is necessary for certain environments like QEMU's user mode. So the issue is within how the Go runtime interacts with system calls when running under specific conditions.

Considering the categories: instruction refers to faulty CPU instructions, syscall relates to issues in system calls or their handling, and runtime covers other runtime errors. Here, the problem is that the Go runtime isn't correctly setting up clone flags for the environment it's running in. Since this involves how the runtime interacts with the OS via syscalls but is specifically about the Go runtime's implementation, I think it falls under 'runtime' rather than a general syscall issue.

So, the category should be 'runtime'.
