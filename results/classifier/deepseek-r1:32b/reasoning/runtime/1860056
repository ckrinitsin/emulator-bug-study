Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report where a Hello World program segfaults when run under QEMU for big-endian 32-bit MIPS on a Debian host. The user has provided that other MIPS architectures (64-bit and little-endian 32-bit) work fine, so the issue is specific to big-endian.

First, I'll consider possible causes of a segmentation fault in this context. Segfaults usually happen when the program tries to access memory it shouldn't, like dereferencing a null pointer or accessing an invalid address. But since this is a simple Hello World program using iostream, maybe it's more about how the standard library is handled.

The toolchain used is mips-linux-gnu-g++, which compiles for MIPS Linux targets. The problem occurs when running under QEMU, suggesting that perhaps the emulator isn't handling something correctly with big-endian 32-bit MIPS.

Looking at possible categories: instruction, syscall, runtime. 

- **Instruction**: This would be if there's a specific instruction in the code causing issues, but the code is simple and works on other architectures.
  
- **Syscall**: If there was an issue with system calls, maybe related to how QEMU emulates them for big-endian MIPS.

- **Runtime**: This category includes other runtime errors that aren't specifically instructions or syscalls. Since the problem is in the emulator's handling of a specific architecture during execution, it might fall here.

I think the issue isn't with the code itself (as it works elsewhere) but how QEMU emulates big-endian MIPS for this case. Maybe something to do with how the standard library interacts with the system calls or memory management under QEMU for that target.
