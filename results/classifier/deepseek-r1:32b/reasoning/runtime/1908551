Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Let me go through each part carefully.

The user is reporting that when they run their test for strnlen using QEMU 5.2.0 with aarch64 SVE emulation, the test fails. However, it works fine when they specify `-cpu max,sve-max-vq=2`. They mention that the code shouldn't be vector length specific, so there's something wrong in how the emulator handles the vector instructions.

Looking at the error messages, the function `__strnlen_aarch64_sve` is returning 64 when it should return values like 32 or 33. This suggests that the SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) functions are not handling certain cases correctly under QEMU's emulation.

The possible categories are:

1. **Instruction**: Faulty instruction description.
2. **Syscall**: Error with a system call.
3. **Runtime**: Other runtime errors.

In this case, the issue isn't about a specific instruction being faulty or a problem with syscalls. Instead, it seems to be related to how QEMU emulates the SVE instructions during runtime, particularly when the vector length isn't set correctly. The test passes when the vector length is limited, indicating that the emulator's handling of variable vector lengths is causing the problem.

Therefore, this bug falls under **runtime** errors because it's an issue with how the emulator processes the code at runtime, specifically with SVE instructions.
