Okay, so I'm looking at this bug report about a compilation failure when trying to build QEMU on Debian unstable. The user provided a lot of details, including their system information and the specific error messages they encountered.

First, I'll try to understand what's going wrong. The errors all seem to be coming from `/usr/include/string.h`, which is part of the C standard library. The compiler is complaining about missing binary operators before certain tokens, like `(` in some macros. There are also errors where `size_t` hasn't been declared and that `__BEGIN_DECLS` isn't a type.

Hmm, why would this happen? Well, looking at the error messages more closely, they seem to be related to preprocessor directives in `string.h`. The compiler is interpreting parts of these macros incorrectly. For example, lines 36, 53, and others are using conditionals like `#if defined __cplusplus && (__GNUC_PREREQ (4, 4)`, but the compiler is treating them as syntax errors.

Wait a minute, this might be an issue with how the preprocessor is handling these conditionals. The error about missing binary operators before "(" suggests that maybe the macros are not being expanded correctly, or perhaps there's an issue with the way they're written in `string.h`.

Another angle: the user is compiling C++ code, but `string.h` is a C header. In C++, you should include `<cstring>` instead of `<string.h>`. Maybe that's causing some compatibility issues. Let me check the source file mentioned: `utils.cc`, which includes `utils.h` from libvixl, and that in turn includes `string.h`.

So perhaps the problem is that when compiling as C++, including a C header like `string.h` can cause issues because of differences in how the preprocessor handles things. For instance, some macros might expand differently or not at all, leading to syntax errors.

Let me think about possible solutions. The first step would be to change the include from `<string.h>` to `<cstring>`, which is the C++-friendly version. This might resolve the preprocessor issues because `<cstring>` is designed for use in C++ and handles things like namespace and function declarations appropriately.

Alternatively, there could be a problem with the way the compiler is handling certain macros or conditionals. Maybe some feature of `string.h` isn't compatible with GCC 10.2.1 when compiling as C++. Checking if others have encountered similar issues might help. I recall that sometimes including `<string.h>` directly in C++ can cause unexpected behavior because it doesn't account for C++ features like namespaces.

Another possibility is that there's a missing include or a define that affects how `string.h` is processed. For example, some headers require certain defines to be set before inclusion to work correctly in different contexts. Maybe adding something like `_GNU_SOURCE` could help, but I'm not sure if that would resolve these specific errors.

Looking at the error messages again: the compiler doesn't recognize `size_t`, which is defined in `<stddef.h>`. So perhaps the issue is that when including `<string.h>` without including `<stddef.h>` first, the necessary types aren't declared. But in C++, including `<cstring>` should handle that by pulling in the correct headers.

Wait, but if the code is written to include `<string.h>` directly, then it's not following standard practice for C++. So changing it to use `<cstring>` might fix both the missing `size_t` and the preprocessor errors.

In summary, the problem seems to stem from including a C header (`<string.h>`) in a C++ source file. This can cause issues because of how the preprocessor handles macros and type declarations differently in C++. The solution would be to replace `<string.h>` with `<cstring>` in the `utils.h` file to ensure proper compatibility when compiling as C++.

The issue arises from including a C header (`<string.h>`) in a C++ source file, leading to preprocessor and type declaration errors. Replacing it with the C++-friendly `<cstring>` resolves these problems.
