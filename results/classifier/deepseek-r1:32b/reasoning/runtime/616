Alright, let's try to figure out where this bug belongs. The problem is about an overflow condition being incorrectly determined after addition on s390x architecture. 

The user provided a C program that uses __builtin_add_overflow to check for integer overflows in both 32-bit and 64-bit contexts. When compiled with GCC for s390x and run under QEMU, the output indicates an overflow occurred (no_overflow = 1), but according to the expected behavior, it shouldn't have.

Looking at the generated assembly code, especially after optimization (-O2), it uses the 'o' condition code which is related to overflow. The code adds two integers and checks if there's an overflow. If not, it returns 0; otherwise, 1.

The issue arises because either GCC is generating incorrect code or QEMU isn't handling the condition code properly. Without access to real hardware, determining the root cause is tricky. However, since the user suggests that a QEMU patch might fix this, it's possible that the problem lies in how QEMU emulates the overflow condition.

In the assembly, after adding %r1 and %r3, the code checks bnor (branch if no overflow). If that doesn't happen, it sets the result to 1. But on s390x, the overflow flag might not be set as expected in QEMU, leading to incorrect behavior.

Since this is about how the emulator handles condition codes during runtime, it's a runtime error specific to QEMU's handling of these instructions.
