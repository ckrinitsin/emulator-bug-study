Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report about QEMU. The user mentioned that pressing Ctrl-Alt-- and Ctrl-Alt-+ doesn't do anything in SDL, even though the manual says they should shrink or enlarge the window. They also tried other key combinations like -/= with shift and without, and even checked the numpad but nothing worked. Their keyboard layout is US intl with AltGr dead keys, and QEMU version 1.5.0.

First, I need to understand what's going on here. The problem is that certain key combinations aren't working as expected in the SDL interface of QEMU. The user expects these shortcuts to adjust the window size but they don't work.

Now, looking at the possible categories: instruction, syscall, runtime. 

- Instruction refers to a faulty manual description. Here, the manual says the shortcuts should work, so if the issue is that the instructions are wrong, it would be an 'instruction' bug.
- Syscall errors relate to system calls failing, which doesn't seem relevant here since the problem is about keyboard input handling.
- Runtime issues involve other runtime errors, like crashes or incorrect behavior during execution.

The user's main issue isn't with the manual being wrong (though they might think it is), but rather that QEMU isn't responding correctly to these key presses. So this seems more like a runtime error because the program isn't behaving as intended when those keys are pressed. It could be a bug in how SDL handles certain key combinations or how QEMU processes them.

Therefore, the category should be 'runtime'.
