Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Let me start by understanding what each category entails.

- **Instruction**: This would involve issues related to specific CPU instructions causing problems. For example, if an instruction is not handled correctly by QEMU.
- **Syscall**: This relates to errors when handling system calls between the guest OS and the host OS in QEMU.
- **Runtime**: These are other runtime-related issues that don't fall into the above two categories.

Looking at the provided bug report, it's a crash log from a Go program. The output shows a lot of goroutines with statuses like "GC worker (idle)" and mentions functions like `runtime.gopark`, which suggests this is related to the Go runtime handling garbage collection or scheduling.

Since the error occurs within the Go runtime's own processes—specifically, issues with goroutines and garbage collection—it doesn't seem to be about a specific instruction or a syscall. Instead, it points to an issue in how the runtime is managing these processes, which falls under the "runtime" category.
