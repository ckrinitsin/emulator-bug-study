Okay, so I need to figure out how to classify this bug report about QEMU leaking memory due to cap_disas_plugin not freeing instructions properly. The user provided that when using QEMU under Valgrind, they noticed a memory leak in the cap_disas_plugin function because it's not calling cs_free(insn, count) before cs_close. 

First, I should understand what each category means. The possible categories are instruction, syscall, and runtime. Instruction seems to relate to issues with specific CPU instructions or their handling. Syscall would involve system calls that aren't working correctly. Runtime is for other errors that occur during the program's execution.

In this case, the issue isn't about a faulty CPU instruction being handled incorrectly. It's more about memory managementâ€”specifically, not freeing memory before closing a resource. This sounds like an error in how resources are managed at runtime rather than an issue with system calls or specific instructions. 

So, since the problem is about a function not properly freeing memory during execution, it falls under runtime errors.
