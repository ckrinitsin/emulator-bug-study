Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report about bad fonts on a "cirrus" VGA card in QEMU. Let me go through it step by step. 

The problem is described as similar to another issue (#988), and it's fixed by setting specific options in the XF86Config file: "no_bitblt" and "sw_cursor". The user mentioned that these changes resolved the font issues.

First, I need to figure out what category this falls under. The categories are instruction, syscall, or runtime. 

The issue here is about the display of fonts on a virtualized VGA card in QEMU. The fix involves modifying configuration settings rather than code execution or system calls. So it's not an instruction issue because there's no faulty CPU instruction mentioned. It's also not a syscall error since the problem doesn't involve system calls failing; instead, it's about how the graphics are rendered.

Since the problem occurs during runtime when the virtual machine is running and using the Cirrus VGA card, it's related to how the software handles certain operations at that time. The configuration changes affect how the display driver behaves during runtime, so this seems like a runtime error category.
