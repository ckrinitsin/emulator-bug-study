Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user mentioned that when they read `/proc/self/task/<pid>/maps` in QEMU 3.1.0, it doesn't get remapped correctly. They noted that the code handling `is_proc_myself` supports remapping for some proc files but not others like `/proc/self/task/<tid>/maps`. Extending this function would fix the issue.

First, I need to understand what each category means. The categories are instruction, syscall, and runtime. 

- **Instruction** refers to issues with individual machine instructions or assembly code.
- **Syscall** involves errors in system calls made by the program.
- **Runtime** covers other runtime errors not related to instructions or syscalls.

This bug seems to involve how QEMU handles certain proc filesystem entries during execution, specifically when trying to remap `/proc/self/task/<tid>/maps`. It's about how the process is managed and data structures are handled at runtime. The function `is_proc_myself` isn't handling these specific files, leading to incorrect mapping.

Since it's related to the code not properly handling certain file paths in the proc filesystem during runtime, this falls under a runtime error. There's no mention of specific instructions or syscalls failing; rather, it's about how the process is being managed while running.
