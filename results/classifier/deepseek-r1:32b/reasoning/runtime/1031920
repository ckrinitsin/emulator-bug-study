Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU's gdbserver not responding to remote Ctrl-C interrupts. The user mentioned that when they run QEMU with gdbserver and connect via GDB, pressing Ctrl-C doesn't interrupt the program as expected.

First, looking at the steps: They started QEMU with '-g 1234', connected GDB remotely, set a breakpoint, continued execution, then tried to interrupt with Ctrl-C. The program didn't stop, and they had to choose 'y' to give up.

I think about what each category means. 'Instruction' is about faulty commands or instructions in the code, which doesn't seem directly related here. 'Syscall' would involve issues with system calls, but this seems more about interrupt handling during runtime.

So it's likely a 'runtime' issue because it's happening while the program is running and interacting with GDB through QEMU. The problem occurs when trying to interrupt execution, which is a runtime operation handled by the debugger and emulator.
