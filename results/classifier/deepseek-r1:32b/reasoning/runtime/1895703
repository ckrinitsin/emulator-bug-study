Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. The report discusses performance degradation in TCG targets after switching to Meson build system. It mentions specific test results showing increased instructions for alpha and m68k targets.

First, considering "instruction": This usually refers to a problem with individual CPU instructions, like incorrect handling or generation. Here, the issue is about performance, not correctness of instructions, so this might not fit.

Next, "syscall": This category deals with system calls going wrong. The report doesn't mention any issues with syscalls, but rather an increase in executed instructions leading to slower performance. So syscall seems unrelated.

Lastly, "runtime": This category covers errors or issues that occur during the execution of the program. Since the problem is about TCG (Translation Code Generation) performance, which affects how code runs and translates at runtime, this fits best. The build system change might have introduced inefficiencies in how TCG generates machine code, causing more instructions to be executed.

Therefore, the category should be "runtime".
