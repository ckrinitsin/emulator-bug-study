Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The issue is about a CI job called `build-user-hexagon` not correctly testing Hexagon. The user provided logs showing that the compiler being used is x86_64 GCC instead of the intended Hexagon cross-compiler. They noticed that the toolchain installs clang but doesn't rename it to something target-specific, so the build system uses the native compiler.

The problem arises during configuration when Meson tries to use `clang` as a native compiler, which fails because it's actually meant for Hexagon. The user suggests renaming the compiler binary and setting the cross-prefix correctly.

This seems like an issue with how the build environment is set up, specifically in the CI container. It's about misconfiguration leading to using the wrong compiler, causing build failures. Since this affects the compilation step, which happens at build time rather than runtime, but I'm not sure if it fits into 'runtime' errors.

Wait, 'instruction' refers to faulty instructions, like assembly issues. 'Syscall' is about system calls failing. This problem isn't about either of those; it's more about the build configuration and toolchain setup. So maybe none of these categories fit perfectly, but perhaps 'runtime' could be a stretch if it affects execution somehow.

But actually, since this issue occurs during the build process due to incorrect compiler usage, it might not fall directly into any of these three categories provided. However, among instruction, syscall, and runtime, I'm leaning towards 'instruction' because it's about how the compiler is being used or instructed incorrectly. But that feels a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps this doesn't fit neatly into any of these categories, but since I have to choose one, maybe 'runtime' isn't accurate either. Hmm, maybe I should consider whether this affects runtime behavior. If the build uses the wrong compiler and produces incorrect binaries, then running those would cause issues at runtime. But the problem described is about the CI job not testing Hexagon correctly during build time.

I think the best fit might be 'runtime' because it's an error that occurs when trying to run code (Meson tries to check if executables are runnable), but I'm not entirely sure.
