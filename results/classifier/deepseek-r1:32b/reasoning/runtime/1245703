Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of three categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Let me read through the problem again to understand what's happening.

The user is using QEMU-user emulation with the -L option pointing to a sysroot directory that includes proc and dev filesystems. They notice that QEMU starts consuming a lot of memory until it gets killed by the kernel. The strace output shows that QEMU is following symbolic links in the proc filesystem, leading to an endless recursive loop.

The user suggests modifying the function "add_dir_maybe" in util/path.c to avoid following symbolic links. They also mention that this issue causes a significant waste of resources because QEMU loads over 20,000 directory entries every time it's started.

Now, thinking about the categories:

- Instruction: This would involve issues with how commands or instructions are handled.
- Syscall: Problems related to system calls made by QEMU.
- Runtime: Errors that occur during runtime, such as memory leaks or infinite loops.

The issue here is an endless loop caused by recursively reading directories, specifically following symbolic links in proc. This leads to high memory usage and a crash. It's happening while QEMU is running, so it's a runtime problem rather than an instruction or syscall error.

So the category should be "runtime."
