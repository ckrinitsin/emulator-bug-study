Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report. The problem is that certain applications crash in their signal handlers because the stack alignment isn't correct when using QEMU's x86_64 userspace. Specifically, there's a `movaps` instruction causing issues due to a misaligned stack address.

Let me break down what I understand from the description. The user provided a backtrace where the crash happens in a signal handler. They mentioned that GDB shows the issue is with `movaps`, which requires 16-byte alignment. But the stack pointer (`$rsp`) when entering the signal handler isn't aligned properly.

The x86_64 psABI says that `(%rsp - 8)` should be a multiple of 16 when control transfers to a function entry point. However, QEMU is setting `$rsp` to align to 16 bytes by ending with `0x..0`. The kernel code provided shows how the stack pointer is adjusted for signal frames.

So, the issue arises because the alignment done in the kernel for the x86_64 userspace isn't correct when handling signals within QEMU. This misalignment causes the `movaps` instruction to fail, leading to a segmentation fault.

Now, looking at the possible categories: instruction, syscall, runtime. The problem here is about how the stack is managed during signal handling in QEMU's execution environment. It doesn't seem to be a faulty instruction per se or a syscall issue. Instead, it's an error that occurs during runtime when the application tries to execute instructions after a signal is handled.

Therefore, this bug falls under the 'runtime' category because it's related to how the program behaves at runtime due to improper stack alignment in signal handlers.
