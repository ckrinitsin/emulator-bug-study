Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Let me read through the problem description again carefully.

The issue is about QEMU not blocking target signals when entering a signal handler. The function process_pending_signals in signal.c blocks host signals but doesn't handle queued QEMU signals properly. This leads to recursion if multiple signals come quickly, causing an abort and core dump.

So, what's happening here? It seems like the problem occurs during runtime because it's about how QEMU handles signals as they're being processed by the target application. The issue isn't related to a specific instruction or a syscall but rather the handling of signals at runtime.

Therefore, this bug falls under the "runtime" category.

The bug report describes an issue with signal handling during execution, which is a runtime problem.
