Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: instruction, syscall, or runtime. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The user is working on a TCG plugin called execlog that's supposed to log register changes, including the PC (program counter). They're using QEMU with the -one-insn-per-tb option and without it. When they run their test binary with this option, the PC updates for each instruction as expected. However, without the option, some PC values aren't updating in the logs even though each instruction should change the PC.

The documentation says that the plugin should dump registers when they change. The user's code correctly reads the PC using qemu_plugin_read_register(), but it seems like this function isn't providing the updated value every time it's called. This suggests a problem with how the register values are being retrieved or tracked within QEMU's TCG plugins.

The issue doesn't involve any specific instruction behaving incorrectly, so it's not an instruction category. It also doesn't seem to be related to system calls since the problem is about register updates during normal execution. Therefore, this falls under a runtime error because it's happening during the normal operation of QEMU when using the plugin.

So, I think the correct category for this bug report is 'runtime'.
