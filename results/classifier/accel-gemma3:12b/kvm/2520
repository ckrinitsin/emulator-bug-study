qemu-system-x86_64 : No Display when system wakeup from suspend
Description of problem:
Qemu display window is blank with message `Display output is not active.`
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use https://gitlab.com/berrange/tiny-vm-tools/-/blob/master/make-tiny-image.py to generate tiny-initrd.img
2. Run qemu and drop into shell
