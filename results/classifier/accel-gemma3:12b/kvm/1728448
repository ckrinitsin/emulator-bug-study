qemu-system-arm segmentation fault with cpu cortex-m*

I try to run an emulation with qemu-system-arm under a cpu cortex-m3 but any execution under the processor result by a segmentation fault. 

My command is : qemu-system-arm -m 256 -M versatilepb -cpu cortex-m3 -kernel ~/qemu/wheezy/vmlinuz-3.2.0-4-versatile -initrd ~/qemu/wheezy/initrd.img-3.2.0-4-versatile -hda ~/qemu/wheezy/hda.img -append 'root=/dev/sda1'

If a lauch the emulation without specifying a cpu equivalent to cortex-m*, the vm opens up well and works but I absolutely need to run it under cortex-m3.


Do you have any idea why I have this problem only with this type of processor ?

I also try with other boards different from versatilepb but I have the same result.

I am under ubuntu 17 64bits during my test.
