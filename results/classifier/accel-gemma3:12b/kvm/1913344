 Exynos4210 UART peripheral data loss

Currently the Exynos4210 UART (hw/char/exynos4210_uart.c) incorrectly reports however many empty bytes are available in the FIFO when queried for receive capacity. However this peripheral supports a polled mode where only a single byte can be submitted at a time and the FIFO is unused, meaning that in polled mode data is lost since it's written into the FIFO and the polling code in FIFO disabled mode only returns the value in the RX data register.

Even worse, potentially enabling the FIFO without a FIFO reset will create a weird situation where data is already in the FIFO whenever data came in faster than the polling could pick it up (which is basically always).

This change obscured the issue in https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1913341, which instead presented as strange data loss until I locally resolved this issue. 

I have a patch ready for the bug and will submit it later today, I'm just filing for clarity.
