QEMU refers to VLAN, but doesn't mean 802.1Q

Throughout the (sparse) documentation and the cmd-line help text, Qemu refers to VLAN ("virtual" LANs), which are unrelated to 802.1Q (tagged ethernet) VLAN, which, IMHO is _very_ confusing. Beyond that, it's also unnecessary, as the network in question isn't "virtual", only the devices used to implement it are.

To avoid further frustration and confusion, can the term VLAN, _please_ be removed from source and documentation and replaced with something more suitable? Perhaps vNIC (seems like VMware is using that term for a similiar concept)?
