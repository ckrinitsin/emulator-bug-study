DISCARD support for Crypto Block Devices

It appears that running `fstrim` or similar is useless when the VM is on a LUKS-encrypted device using QEMU's native LUKS support.

Looking at the source, it seems that block/crypto.c lacks an implementation for bdrv_co_pdiscard, which probably needs to delegate to a per-crypto type discard helper.
