USB keyboard and mouse sucked into qemu-kvm (somewhere)

i am unable to run a command line qemu that does not "suck in" the keyboard and mouse of the host PC
i tried all that i could from the command line parameters i want to run a headless gui-less kvm host

if i specify a second set of keyboard and mouse with the -usb the only thing that is diffrent is that i have a keyboard and mouse in the VM if i specify the host keyboard and mouse same thing ... the vm is working fine but the host has no control , no keyboard. i dont see any output of anything 
the only recourse i have is ctrl+alt+delete  and that resets the host after 2-3 times. 

i tried ctrl+alt, ctrl+alt+x , c , z , 2 , etc... also alt + all those combination and alt with F keys 
no luck. 


my command line looks like this (altough i tried many other variations)
 
qemu-system-x86_64 -M q35 -enable-kvm \
-cpu host,kvm=off -m 4096 -smp cpu=4,sockets=1,cores=4,treads=1 \
-drive file=xyz.qcow2,if=scsi \
-device vfio-pci, ... (GPU) \
-device vfio-pci, .... (GPU audio) \
-usb -usbdevice host:XXXX:XXXX -usbdevice host:XXXX:XXXX \   <<< same behaviour with and without
-vga none -vnc localhost:1 -daemonize  

i tried with -nographics , -curses, -monitor stdio, pty and none, same result and with -serial as well
tried </dev/null at the end of the command no luck same with & 

my guess is that the keyboard and mouse gets grabbed by the "window" of the qemu regardless if there is graphics or not and i have not foud a "-headless" ,"-nograb" or "-nopussygrab" mode . (yeah had to make the joke :P)
