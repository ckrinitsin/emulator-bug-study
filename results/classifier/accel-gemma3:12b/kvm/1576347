Only one NVMe device is usable in Windows (10) guest

Full command: qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cpu host -smp cores=4 -m 4G -net bridge -net nic -full-screen -drive file=ovmf_x64.bin,format=raw,if=pflash -drive file=disks/win16_ide.img,format=raw,cache=none,aio=native -drive file=disks/one.img,if=none,format=qcow2,id=one -drive file=disks/two.img,if=none,format=qcow2,id=two -device nvme,drive=one,serial=E86C3CFC43518D6F -device nvme,drive=two,serial=2BDAC262CF831698

QEMU version: 2.5.0

Kernel: 4.5.1 (Arch Linux)

When there are two NVMe devices specified, only the second one will be usable in Windows. The following error is shown under "Device status" of the failed NVMe controller in Device Manager:

"This device cannot start. (Code 10)

The I/O device is configured incorrectly or the configuration parameters to the driver are incorrect."

The only thing seems suspicious to me is that the nvme emulation in qemu does not have WWN/EUI-64 set for the devices, though I have no idea at all whether that is mandatory:
