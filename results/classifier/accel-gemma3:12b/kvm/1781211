HAXM acceleration does not work at all.

I have qemu windows build 2.12.90, haxm 7.2.0. Ubuntu, nor arch linux does not works when i turn on hax acceleration. Permanent kernel panics, black screen freezing and other crashes happens when i run qemu.
Qemu crashed with hax - when i ran it from iso. It crashed on already installed system - it's not matters. 

Versions:
archlinux-2018.07.01-x86_64
ubuntu-18.04-live-server-amd64.iso

I run qemu-system-x86_64.exe binary.

My CPU:
core i7 2600k
