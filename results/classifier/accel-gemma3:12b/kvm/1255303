ALSA underruns occurr when using QEMU

I'm running QEMU 1.6.1 on a 64-bit Gentoo Linux system. The guest operating system is Windows 7 32-bit. I get multiple identical warning messages when using the ac97 or hda sound cards:

> ALSA lib /var/tmp/portage/media-libs/alsa-lib-1.0.27.2/work/alsa-lib-1.0.27.2/src/pcm/pcm.c:7843:(snd_pcm_recover) underrun occurred

The difference between ac97 and hda is that the former works well, while the latter causes the sound to be garbled.

/var/tmp/portage is the directory where Portage, the Gentoo package manager, builds programs. I don't know why it is mentioned in the error message.

I also don't know if this is an ALSA problem or a QEMU problem.

The command I use is:

> qemu-system-i386 -cpu host -m 1G -k it -drive file=~/QEMU/Windows_7_Privato.qcow2,media=disk,index=0 -vga std -net nic -net user -enable-kvm -display sdl -soundhw ac97 -device usb-ehci,id=ehci -usb -rtc base=localtime -usbdevice tablet

My real sound card is an Intel HD Audio:

> lspci | grep "Audio device"

> 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 02)

Please tell me if you need other informations.
