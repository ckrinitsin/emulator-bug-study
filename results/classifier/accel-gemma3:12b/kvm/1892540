qemu can no longer boot NetBSD/sparc

Booting NetBSD/sparc in qemu no longer works.  It broke between qemu version 5.0.0 and 5.1.0, and a bisection identified the following as the offending commit:

  [5d971f9e672507210e77d020d89e0e89165c8fc9] memory: Revert "memory: accept mismatching sizes in memory_region_access_valid"

It's still broken as of 7fd51e68c34fcefdb4d6fd646ed3346f780f89f4.

To reproduce, run

  wget http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-9.0/images/NetBSD-9.0-sparc.iso
  qemu-system-sparc -nographic -cdrom NetBSD-9.0-sparc.iso -boot d

The expected behavior is that the guest boots to the prompt

The observed behavior is a panic:
