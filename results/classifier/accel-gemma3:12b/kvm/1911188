qemu-system-x86_64 prints obscure error message and exits when encountering an empty argument

QEMU emulator version 4.2.1 (qemu-4.2.1-1.fc32) on Fedora 32.

When writing a script to start qemu automatically, I ran into a very confusing error message due to a bug in my script and had trouble understanding it. I isolated the problem to the following:

$ qemu-system-x86_64 ""
qemu-system-x86_64: Initialization of device ide-hd failed: Device needs media, but drive is empty

As you can see, running qemu with an empty argument prints a seemingly random and unrelated error message about an ide-hd device, and the program immediately exits with code 1. This happens when an empty argument appears anywhere in the arguments list, always causing the program to immediately die with this error.

This is a simply baffling message to be encountering when the problem is really an empty argument.

Expected behaviour: Either flatly ignore the empty argument, or at most trigger a warning (eg, "warning: saw empty argument"). It should not at all prevent the program from running.
