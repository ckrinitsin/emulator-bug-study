DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL booting WIndows XP with Synaptics driver installed

Positng the issue here since I did not get any reply on the ML.

I was trying to update some windows XP (SP3) images in kvm.

It worked fine several times but last time I added mass storage
drivers to sysprep and now on the second boot after reseal (the first
is mini-setup) I get a BSOD with message
DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL. I can post the screenshot if somebody
thinks it is interesting enough.

The same image works on hardware (which has controllers different from
the qemu PIIX3) and in VirtualBox (with the default PIIX4 as well as
PIIX3) so long as IO apic is enabled).

I am not sure if this is an error with the MS drivers or how they are
used in sysprep in this particular case or if his is some strange
error in qemu emulation in the PIIX3 controller or elsewhere.

The image is originally created on hardware with MP acpi (not virtualization).
