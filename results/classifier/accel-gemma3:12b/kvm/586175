Windows XP/2003 doesn't boot

Hello everyone,

my qemu doesn't boot any Windows XP/2003 installations if I try to boot the image.
If I boot the install cd first, it's boot manager counts down and triggers the boot on it's own. That's kinda stupid.

I'm using libvirt, but even by a simple
> qemu-kvm -drive file=image.img,media=disk,if=ide,boot=on
it won't boot. Qemu hangs at the message "Booting from Hard Disk..."

I'm using qemu-kvm-0.12.4 with SeaBIOS 0.5.1 on Gentoo (No-Multilib and AMD64). It's a server, that means I'm using VNC as the primary graphic output but i don't think it should be an issue.
