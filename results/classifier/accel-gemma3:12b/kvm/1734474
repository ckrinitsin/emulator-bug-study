Maemo does not boot on emulated N800

I start QEMU with qemu-system-arm-m 130 -M n800 -kernel zImage.1 -mtdblock maemo.img -append "root=/dev/mtdblock3 rootfstype=jffs2"
On QEMU 1.2.0 see "NOKIA" logo and then desktop appears, but on 1.5.0 and newer (including latest versions) I see only white screen and no signs of life. Was this caused by regression or any syntax change?
