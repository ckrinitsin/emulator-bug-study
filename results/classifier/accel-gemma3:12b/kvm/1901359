ignore bit 0 in pci CONFIG_ADDRESS register write for Type 1 access

I'v recently stumbled upon a bug in the Plan9 PCI config space access routines for config mode #1.

The code used to set bit 0 in the CONFIG_ADDRESS register for a Type 1 access.

This was most likely a misreading of the PCI local bus specification on our side.

However, in the PCI local bus specification 3.0, it states the following:

> 3.2.2.3.2 Software Generation of Configuration Transactions
> ...
> For Type 1 translations, the host bridge directly copies the contents of the
> CONFIG_ADDRESS register (excluding bits 31 and 0) onto the PCI AD lines during the
> address phase of a configuration transaction making sure that AD[1::0] is "01".

note the: "excluding bits 31 and 0"

What happens in qemu instead is that it uses bit 0 of the CONFIG_ADDRESS
register as part of the register offset (when it probably should ignore it)
when translating from Type 1 to Type 0 address. So once it reaches the device
behind the bridge the register address is off by one.
