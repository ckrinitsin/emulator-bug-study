Problem: after boot, when type poweroff -f it hangs (not quitting). I have tested this for x86_64, and aarch64 and it works fine. The problem appears only for risv64(of those mentioned). Last time i have checked it worked also for riscv64 and it was on the d0f90e1423b4f412adc620eee93e8bfef8af4117 commit
