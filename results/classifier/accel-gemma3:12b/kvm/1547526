Java program does not execute on SPARC Solaris 8

Hello, 

I am trying to run a java program that never execute. The program uses jre1.1.5 which came with the java program. I don't know what to do to run this application. There are some random messages in command line that can be related to my problem (or not). They are:

	#1. Webstart launcher crashing.
	Also found here: http://www.openfirmware.info/pipermail/openbios/2011-May/006472.html

	#2. Assertion failed: MUTEX_HELD(&svc_mutex), file rpc/svc_run.c, line 766
	Which was already reported here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1450881

	#3. Some problems with libthread in Solaris. 
	I have tried a workaround setting LM_LIBRARY_PATH to use another version of libthread that Solaris 8 has.

I don't know if this is a qemu problem or Solaris problem.
My java application can be executed in command line or in GUI but I've tried both with no luck. I also have tryed other versions of JRE from 1.1.8 to 1.5 but no luck either.

I appreciate **any information** that can help me to execute the java program!!
Thank you.

I am using qemu-system-sparc (v2.5.50) with Solaris 8 (solaris-8-hw4-2.04-sparc).
The host is an Ubuntu 15.10 and I am using the openbios-sparc from Ubuntus ppa as shown bellow:

	openbios-sparc | 1.1+svn1334-1 | http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ wily/universe amd64 Packages

The command line used to launch qemu is:

	qemu-system-sparc \
		-M SS-5 \
		-m 256 \
		-boot c \
		-cdrom $(DATA_ISO) \
		-drive file=root-disk.img,index=0,media=disk,format=raw \
		-serial stdio \
		-monitor tcp::4444,server,nowait \
		-localtime \
		-net user \
		-net nic \
		$(ui)

DATA_ISO is the way I found to send my data to the guest.

The root-disk.img is:
