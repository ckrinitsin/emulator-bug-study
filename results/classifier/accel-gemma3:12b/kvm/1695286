Add multiboot2 support

multiboot2 is a recent specification that resolves some of the issues of multiboot. Multiboot2 is supported by some tools already (e.g. grub).

It would be great if one can run OS with multiboot2 using '-kernel' option, similar as it is done now with multiboot images.

Quick googling shows there is a Debian bug and patch that adds multiboot support https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=621529 Would it be possible to integrate it to QEMU upstream?
