UHCI fails to signal stall response

When TD execution results in STALL error (STALL handshake, no stall as a result of err count reaching 0), there is no way to know about it except for checking that TD. IMO it is an error condition and it should be reflected in the status register (and issue an interrupt if enabled).

Ways to replicate:
Send a query that is answered by stall (like set_idle request to a mouse)

Expected behavior:
UHCI hc sets status bit 1 (usb error interrupt) and issues an interrupt

current behavior:
Neither status bit is set nor interrupt triggered
