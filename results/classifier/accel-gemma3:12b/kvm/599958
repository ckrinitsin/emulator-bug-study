Timedrift problems with Win7: hpet missing time drift fixups

We've been finding timedrift issues witth Win7 under qemu-kvm on our daily testing

kvm.qemu-kvm-git.smp2.Win7.64.timedrift.with_load	FAIL	1	Time drift too large after rest period: 38.63%
kvm.qemu-kvm-git.smp2.Win7.64.timedrift.with_reboot	FAIL	1	Time drift too large at iteration 1: 17.77 seconds
kvm.qemu-kvm-git.smp2.Win7.64.timedrift.with_migration	FAIL	1	Time drift too large at iteration 2: 3.08 seconds

Steps to reproduce:

timedrift.with_load

1) Log into a guest.
2) Take a time reading from the guest and host.
3) Run load on the guest and host.
4) Take a second time reading.
5) Stop the load and rest for a while.
6) Take a third time reading.
7) If the drift immediately after load is higher than a user-
    specified value (in %), fail.
    If the drift after the rest period is higher than a user-specified value,
    fail.

timedrift.with_migration

1) Log into a guest.
2) Take a time reading from the guest and host.
3) Migrate the guest.
4) Take a second time reading.
5) If the drift (in seconds) is higher than a user specified value, fail.

timedrift.with_reboot

1) Log into a guest.
2) Take a time reading from the guest and host.
3) Reboot the guest.
4) Take a second time reading.
5) If the drift (in seconds) is higher than a user specified value, fail.

This bug is to register those issues and keep an eye on them.
