nested 9p filesystem with security_model=mapped-xattr

I do not know whether this is a bug or a feature request, but on a 9p virtfs with security_model=mapped-xattr, access to extended attributes starting with "user.virtfs" coming from the guest seem to be silently ignored. Would it not be more correct to use some sort of "escaping", say map to "user.virtfs.x" on guest to "user.virtfs.virtfs.x" on host or something like that, so that the guest can use arbitrary attributes.

In particular, this would allow nested virtual machines to use nested 9p virtfs with security_model=mapped-xattr.
