Mouse pointer disappears when it is over console window

The host mouse pointer disappears when it is over a console window.

I am emulating quite simple hardware: just text console and no mouse. I don't expect the mouse to have any effect on the emulated computers, but I need to know where the mouse pointer is. That is  important because I need to use the mouse to switch between applications and to switch between virtual machines (QEMU grabs Alt+Tab events). Also, it is quite tricky to work with multiple screens when we don't know where the mouse pointer is.

I am using:
* Virtual Machine Manager 2.2.1
* QEMU 4.2.0
* Fedora 32
* KDE Plasma 5.18.5
