Cannot build qemu-5.0.0 from tarball

Cannot build qemu 5.0.0 from the release tarball. Building from git-clone succeeds.

After downloading and unpacking the 5.0.0 tarball, I typed the following:

mkdir build
cd build
../configure

Then got the following error message:

ERROR: missing file /home/uri/qemu-5.0.0/ui/keycodemapdb/README

This is not a GIT checkout but module content appears to
be missing. Do not use 'git archive' or GitHub download links
to acquire QEMU source archives. Non-GIT builds are only
supported with source archives linked from:

  https://www.qemu.org/download/#source

Developers working with GIT can use scripts/archive-source.sh
if they need to create valid source archives.

It appears the ui/keycodemapdb is missing some files that are obtained from a git submodule in a git tree.

Building from a git clone succeeds.
