Arabic keyboard layout wrong.
Description of problem:
After a while the compilation process starts, xkb gives an error about symbols/ar not found. According to my research, linux distros using "ara" for arabic layout. But qemu pc-bios/keymaps/ folder contains "ar" for arabic layout.
Steps to reproduce:
1.Configure
2.Build
3.Wait until error appears.
