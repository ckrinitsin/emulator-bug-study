Ability to use -net socket with unix sockets

It would be a nice feature (simplifying access control for example) to be able to do something like:

qemu -net socket,listen=unix:/tmp/qemunet
qemu -net socket,connect=unix:/tmp/qemunet

For now one has to use TCP connections even for guests running on the same host, which involves setting up iptables to restrict access.
