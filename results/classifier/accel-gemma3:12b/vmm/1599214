virtlogd: qemu 2.6.0 doesn't log boot message

This report is related to the OpenStack Nova bug [1].

OpenStack tries to utilize the "virtlogd" feature of qemu [2].

steps to reproduce:
1) launch a quest with qemu 2.6.0 which uses virtlogd for the stdout/stderr of its char device
2) check the contents of the backing file of that char device

expected result:
The boot messages of the guest are logged in this file

actual result:
The file is empty

notes:
When I'm connected to that char device and reboot the guest, I see the boot messages in the terminal and also in the backing log file.
