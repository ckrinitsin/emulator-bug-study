Disk corrupted after snapshot deletion

  I found the vm disk corruption after snapshot deletion sometimes(the probability is very low, I'm afraid i can't reproduce it). And I found there is a patch for it as follow, but I'm not sure whether the patch repaired the bug. 
  Drain disk before snapshot deletion can't guarantee anything, there is still pending IO in snapshot-deletion process. Anyone can help?

snapshot: add bdrv_drain_all() to bdrv_snapshot_delete() to avoid concurrency problem
If there are still pending i/o while deleting snapshot,
because deleting snapshot is done in non-coroutine context, and
the pending i/o read/write (bdrv_co_do_rw) is done in coroutine context,
so it's possible to cause concurrency problem between above two operations.
Add bdrv_drain_all() to bdrv_snapshot_delete() to avoid this problem.
