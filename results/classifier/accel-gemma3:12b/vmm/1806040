Nested VMX virtualization error on last Qemu versions

Recently updated Qemu on a Sony VAIO sve14ag18m with Ubuntu Bionic 4.15.0-38 from Git

After launching a few VMs, noticed that i could not create Snapshot due to this error:
"Nested VMX virtualization does not support live migration yet"

I've created a new Windows 7 X64 machine with this compilation of Qemu and the problem persisted, so it's not because of the old machines.

I launch Qemu with this params (I use them for malware analisys adn re...):
qemu-system-x86_64 -monitor stdio -display none -m 4096 -smp cpus=4 -usbdevice tablet -drive file=VM.img,index=0,media=disk,format=qcow2,cache=unsafe -net nic,macaddr="...." -net bridge,br=br0 -cpu host,-hypervisor,kvm=off -vnc 127.0.0.1:0 -enable-kvm 


Deleting the changes made on this commit solved the problem, but I dont have idea what is this for, so... xDD
