Keyboard not fully working on Windows version

Hello,

I am working with windows qemu version:

qemu-w64-setup-20190815

I have installed a msdos virtual machine on qemu with sp keyboard layout (Spain at Europe). I have found that some keys do not work in the way they should. I believe that the problem is that es qemu spanish keyboard layout is the latin one, la in msdos sysytem.

I ask you to create the Spain layout.



Thanks in advance.
