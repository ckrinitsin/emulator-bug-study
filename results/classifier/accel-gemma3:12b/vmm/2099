Setting for initial GTK window size?
Description of problem:

Steps to reproduce:
1. When starting QEMU on Windows, the GTK window size appears to be sized to approx 640x480, which is very hard to see on a 4k+ monitor.  So interacting with the boot, reading BIOS messages, etc, isn't great.
2. It would be great to be able to specify the dimensions of the GTK window, say 2560x1600, and then just set "Zoom to Fit".
3. This way, the visible window area remains constant, and all stages of graphical interaction get scaled to a workable size.
4. The OS can be configured to say 2560x1600 once setup.
5. Perhaps I've overlook settings to accomplish this?

Thank you.
