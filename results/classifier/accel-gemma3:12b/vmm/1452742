the option for vdagent communication needed for qxl scren resizing is not documented

Hello,

I tried running a guest with vdagent which is supposed to resize the guest screen to match client window size.

However, a special serial port needs to be created for the vdagent to communicate with the client.

This patch adds a short note to the vga qxl option.
