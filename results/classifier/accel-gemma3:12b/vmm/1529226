qemu-i386-user on 32-bit Linux: uncaught target signal 11 

Even though the command I'm trying to run (a wrapper script for qemu-i386-user running rustc, the rust compiler)  produces the expected  compiled output, the build process is interrupted:

qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
i686-unknown-linux-gnu/stage0/bin/rustc: line 1:  7474 Segmentation fault      /usr/local/bin/qemu-i386 -cpu qemu32 /home/petevine/stage0/rustc.bin -C target-cpu=pentium2 -L /home/petevine/unpacked/rust-master/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/stage0/lib/rustlib/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/ "$@"
make: *** [i686-unknown-linux-gnu/stage0/lib/rustlib/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/stamp.rustc_back] Error 139

The stamp file is not being created so this could be about forking bash after finishing the wrapper script.

Qemu was compiled from the latest git source.
