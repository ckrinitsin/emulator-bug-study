Minimal Ubuntu vs. Debian differences

I'm using Qemu on Ubuntu (minimal) and Debian (minimal) on Android (Arch64) via Linux Deploy to run Windows guests. Here's a few issues I encountered:

1) Qemu on (minimal) Debian 9 and Ubuntu cannot run Windows 7-10 guests (only Windows XP and below) because there's a black screen after the boot menu. Qemu on Debian 10, however, can run Windows 7. Incidentally, these distros run on the host in bios compatibility mode instead of UEFI. Ubuntu Desktop (full distro) on other hosts does not display the black screen when running Qemu.

2) Qemu on Debian 9-10 (minimal) does not display fullscreen - but Ubuntu minimal does display full-screen.

3) Qemu on Limbo PC Emulator and on Debian 9-10 only run windows guests at 1 GHz using the default Qemu CPU, but Ubuntu runs windows guests at 2 GHz using the default Qemu CPU.

4) Enable KVM doesn't work, and virtualization isn't detected through Limbo PC Emulator and minimal Linux distros running on Android - perhaps is a problem with running Linux distros via Linux Deploy using Chroot on Android (not so much a Qemu-KVM issue) and failing to detect ARMv8-A CPUs that are indeed capable of virtualization.

Can anyone explain these differences? I believe they are all using the latest versions of Qemu.
