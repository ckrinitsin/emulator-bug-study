Qemu DOS Quake - 640x480 and above resolutions - Unable to load VESA palette in dos prompt and game crashing are not working 

I have problem make Quake Demo working with 640x480+, with 320x200 working fine.
I tried 3 virtual videocards settings: -vga cirrus 640x480 is not available, probably emulated GPU has not enough VRAM or some Vesa2 utility is needed. For -vga std and -vga vmware // 640x480 is available in game menu, but when i tried to set it, im getting: Unable to load VESA palette in dos prompt and game crashing.
With vmware svgaII other Q2DOS 640x480 and 1024x768 its working fine, so it not working only with some games.

  Qemu 4.2, its same on Linux and Windows.
