PPC msgsnd for DOORBELL CRITICAL masked by MSR[EE] instead of MSR[CE]
Description of problem:
When executing PPC instruction "msgsnd r3. with r3 = 0x08000001" an DOORBELL CRITICAL exception is raised on core number 1. But this exception is masked by MSR\[EE\] bit, the MSR\[EE\] should be set to 1 in core1 to get this exception. But the NXP E500MCRM.pdf reference manual indicates that MSR\[CE\] is the mask bit for DOORBELL_CRITICAL Exception.
Additional information:
In qemu-8.1.2/target/ppc/excp_helper.c i try to change in ppc_next_unmasked_interrupt_generic function:
   
```
if (FIELD_EX64(env->msr, MSR, CE)) {
    /* Critical doorbell */
    if (env->pending_interrupts & PPC_INTERRUPT_CDOORBELL) {   <- move this part from (async_deliver != 0)
        return PPC_INTERRUPT_CDOORBELL;
     }
     /* External critical interrupt */
     if (env->pending_interrupts & PPC_INTERRUPT_CEXT) {
         return PPC_INTERRUPT_CEXT;
     }
}
```
 

And it seems to work in my case.
