POWER9 emulation is broken when compiler optimizations are on (for gcc 11.3 and later)
Description of problem:
Comparing two floating point memory operands produces incorrect result
Steps to reproduce:
1. Unpack attached archive and change to test_p64 directory
2. Build the source file with: powerpc64le-linux-gnu-g++ -O2 -static test.cpp -o test_p64
3. Run with QEMU: qemu-ppc64le -cpu POWER9 test_p64 > output.txt
4. Check the output text file output.txt (with pluma or any other text editor) to see the printouts
Additional information:
The pre-built binary and its output file are attached as test_p64.tar.gz[test_p64.tar.gz](/uploads/0e9dbc22e6841496efc15775e6aa624a/test_p64.tar.gz)

The purpose of this report is to motivate the creation of a point release QEMU 6.2.1 for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (which will be supported for years to come). Also cross-linking similar bug report for MIPS with exact same goal: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1531
