vnc websocket option not properly parsed when running on commandline

All of my vms are started with a simple script on the command line.  
Starting with Qemu 2.3.0, the option "-vnc host:port,websocket" is no longer working.

Previously if I said listen on Tor:17,websocket it would function correctly.  Now it's kicking an error:


qemu-system-x86_64: -vnc tor:17,websocket: Failed to start VNC server on `(null)': address resolution failed for tor:on: Servname not supported for ai_socktype

The error leads me to believe it's not parsing the command line options for the "vnc" option correctly.  If I leave off ",websocket" it works correctly.  I've even tried, replacing the hostname with an IP address, and using the alternate form " -display vnc=tor:17,webscoket". It reports the same error.
