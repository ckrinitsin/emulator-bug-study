COLO's guest VNC client hang after failover

Hello,

After setting up COLO's primary and secondary VMs,
I installed the vncserver and xrdp (apt install tightvncserver xrdp) inside the VM.

I access the VM from another PC via VNC/RDP client, and everything is OK.
Then, kill the primary VM and issue the failover commands.

The expected result is that the VNC/RDP client can resume after failover.
But in my test, the VNC client's screen hangs and cannot be recovered no longer.

BTW, it works well after killing SVM.

Thanks.

Regards,
Derek
