[Performance Regression] Constant freezes on Alder lake and Raptor lake CPUs.
Description of problem:
Strangely, no logs are recorded. The guest just freezes. It can however be rescued by a simple pause and unpause.

This issue only happens when using the KVM hypervisor. Other hypervisors are fine.

This issue does NOT happen when I tested my Intel Core i7 8700K.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a basic virtual machine for Windows 11 (Or 10).
2. Run it for about 5 - 30 minutes (Sometimes it happens in 20 seconds or even less).
3. The problem should occur.
