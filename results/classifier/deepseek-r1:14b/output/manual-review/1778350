Android-x86 4.4-r5 won't boot on QEMU since v2.11.0-rc2

Try to boot from the Android-x86 4.4-r5 ISO won't boot in QEMU after 2.11.0-rc2. The last known version it works is 2.11.0-rc1.
It also works on the 2.10.x-line, even the 2.10.2 which was released after 2.11.0-rc2!

How to reproduce:
Download the ISO from
http://www.android-x86.org/releases/releasenote-4-4-r5 or directly https://www.fosshub.com/Android-x86.html/android-x86-4.4-r5.iso

Start QEMU with this command-line: qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom android-x86-4.4-r5.iso -m 1024

On 2.11.0-rc1 and 2.10.2 after selecting to boot from CD it shows the Android splash after a short while ...
On 2.11.0-rc2 through the latest 2.12 line it goes to black screen shortly right after selecting to boot from CD
