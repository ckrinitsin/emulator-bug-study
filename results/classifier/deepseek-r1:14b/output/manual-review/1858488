qemu git && 4.2:  timed audio issues with sb16,  gus not working?


I have built [both] current git, and 4.2.0, there are issues with audio/soundhw for both.

Specifics:

Linux nullrig 5.3.0-24-generic #26-Ubuntu SMP Thu Nov 14 01:33:18 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Out of source build, successful for both:

../configure --prefix=/opt/qemu --target-list=i386-softmmu,mips64el-softmmu ---enable-sdl --enable-sdl-image --enable-lzo --enable-bzip2 --enable-avx2 --enable-kvm --enable-membarrier --enable-plugin

Call:

./qemu -machine pc,accel=kvm,usb=off -cpu pentium -m 64 -rtc base=localtime -parallel none -soundhw sb16,adlib,pcspk -device cirrus-vga,bus=pci.0 -drive id=disk1,file=doom.cow,format=qcow2,if=virtio -audiodev pa,id=pa 

Audio for sb16 sounds ok,  however if i switch to a timer based audio: -audiodev wav

The output is wrong..  I had assumed it was all timer based audio, however it seems to be limited to sb16.

So I then tried the next popular/compatible audio device for dos games:  gravis ultrasound [gus].

I get no output at all for it.
I have tried more than one piece of software,  DOOM shareware is any easy example.

I realize there are better solutions for playing DOS games, however I am interested in snapshot support which many of them lack.

I am willing to put the work into fixing it myself if need be,  however i'm not very familiar with the audio backend.   Specifically, it is already mixed into a single buffer,  if 'adlib' driver is already working: (audio_pcm_ops.write() output is correct on timer based output) I failed to see how it affects emulation of the sound blaster.
