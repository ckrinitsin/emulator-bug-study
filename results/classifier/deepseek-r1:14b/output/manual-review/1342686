Windows 95 setup hangs

Windows 95 (first version, not 95A or OSR2) setup hangs on QEMU version 2.0.0. It was compiled from the sources on Fedora 20. 
Setup starts without problems, it goes through the first phase and then hangs on the "Getting ready to run Windows 95 for the first time..." screen (http://www.guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win95#win95startupshutdownsplash1correctaspect).

Steps to reproduce:
qemu-img create -f qcow2 win95.img 2G
qemu -L . -machine isapc -cpu pentium -m 32 -vga std -soundhw sb16 -hda win95.img -cdrom POLWIN95.ISO -fda BOOT95A.IMA -boot a
after this select default options everywhere. When it asks to remove the boot floppy do "eject floppy0" and confirm.
It displays the "Getting ready to run Windows 95 for the first time..." and hangs.

The same behavior can be observed on 2.1.0-rc2. On 1.7.1 It hangs immediately after this screen, it hangs on displaying a underscore cursor.

I managed to complete the setup on QEMU 1.6.2.
