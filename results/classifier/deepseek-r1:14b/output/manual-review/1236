blockdev fixed vhdx trying to reserve space, also misleading error, Could not open file: Invalid argument
Description of problem:
The qemu-storage-daemon/other qemu commands will not start and will choke on requiring vhdx driver for the blockdev layer.
Opening a fixed-virtual-disk like fixed-vhdx should not reserve extra space, and should only overwrite as all blocks are already allocated.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Ensure that a partition size is such that after deciding a fixed-vhdx size, the remainder space after creation of fixed-vhdx is less than the fixed-vhdx.
2. Create a fixed-vhdx file 
3. Try to start an nbd server with it
the qemu-storage-daemon will not start
Additional information:
I want to mention that I am testing qemu-storage-daemon under windows/hyperv

So far, I want to report that it has **worked** for rawimg and qcow2-fixed.  
See comment of 20220926 https://github.com/cloudbase/wnbd/issues/63#issuecomment-1257148849 

The driver parameter ```vhdx``` to the blockdev argument seems to struggle with it.

I wanted to check if the vhdx blockdev driver has the same VHDX-related-bugs as qemu-nbd 
- #727 VHDX is corrupted on expansion.
- #806 Fixed VHDX inflates beyond its fixed size when data is copied onto it and also corrupts 

Even the the blockdev reference entries seem to have VHDX all over the place
