default memory parameter too small on x86_64 today

Launching a centos7 VM today does not work anymore on x86_64 without increasing the size of the memory parameter. For example with this command :

$ /opt/qemu-3.0.0/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 --curses   -enable-kvm -drive file=file.dd,index=0,media=disk -drive file=centos-x86_64.iso,index=1,media=cdrom

[    3.047614] Failed to execute /init
[    3.048315] Kernel panic - not syncing: No init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel. See Linux Documentation/init.txt for guidance.
[    3.049258] CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 3.10.0-693.21.1.el7.x86



Increasing the size from the default 128MiB to 512MiB let the VM works without problem.
So, ok, it's not a qemu problem, it's more a "User problem" and interface problem for me.
But it push me in the end to launch VirtualBox instead of qemu, because the default parameter does not work anymore... And I had no time to investigate why it does not work because the message is not visible.
Debian iso with the same command line for example show a message to tell me that there is not enough memory, so it help me to track the real issue behind.

But... In the end, I think today, the default memory parameter on x86_64 is too small and it can lead some people like me to switch to VirtualBox.
VirtualBox, in the wizard is set by default to 4MiB Ram size, which tell you... Ok I need to put more. But, you know that 4MiB is not enough in the end.
