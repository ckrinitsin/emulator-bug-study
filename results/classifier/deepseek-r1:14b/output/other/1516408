sh4: Unsupported syscall: 186

Hello!

I'm currently testing qemu as a possibility to set up a buildd for the Debian sh4 port.

I set up qemu and an sh4 chroot as described in the Debian Wiki [1]. This seems to be working mostly fine (besides the fact that qemu segfaults on an amd64 host while it runs fine on an i386 host, I'll file a separate bug report). However, when installing python3.4 in the sh4 chroot, qemu repeatedly printed an error message about an unimplemented syscall: 186:

qemu: Unsupported syscall: 186

From the source code in linux-user/sh4/syscall_nr.h it's apparent that 186 is defined as 

#define TARGET_NR_sigaltstack   186

Looking at the implementation part, it becomes obvious that this syscall is not enabled for sh4:

#if defined(TARGET_I386) || defined(TARGET_ARM) || defined(TARGET_MIPS) || \
    defined(TARGET_SPARC) || defined(TARGET_PPC) || defined(TARGET_ALPHA) || \
    defined(TARGET_M68K) || defined(TARGET_S390X) || defined(TARGET_OPENRISC)
        ret = do_sigaltstack(arg1, arg2, get_sp_from_cpustate((CPUArchState *)cpu_env));
        break;
#else
        goto unimplemented;
#endif

Is there any particular reason why TARGET_NR_sigaltstack is not enabled on sh4? If not, could you enable it?

Thanks,
Adrian
