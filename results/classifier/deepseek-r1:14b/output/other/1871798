Fails to start on Windows host without explicit --disable-pie

Since commit d2cd29e30736afd4a1e8cac3cf4da360bbc65978, which removed the x86 conditional around PIE, QEMU completely fails to start on a Windows host unless --disable-pie is explicitly given at build time. Even just requesting the help text doesn't work. To make testing easier, this can be replicated with Wine.
