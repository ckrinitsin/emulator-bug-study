QEMU does not express a dependency on perl-Test-Harness

This is a minor thing; in Fedora you can install most of the developer dependencies by issuing something like `dnf builddep qemu-kvm` and this takes care of just about everything such that you can run ./configure and make.

For "make check" though, configure doesn't catch that you'll need perl-Test-Harness; so it fails halfway through the check routine, and you'll see this:

```
Can't locate TAP/Parser.pm in @INC (you may need to install the TAP::Parser module) (@INC contains: /usr/local/lib64/perl5 /usr/local/share/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /usr/share/perl5) at ./scripts/tap-driver.pl line 30.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./scripts/tap-driver.pl line 30.
make: *** [/home/jhuston/src/qemu/tests/Makefile.include:905: check-unit] Error 2
```

I'm not sure how we should express this dependency; it shouldn't be a requirement for building, but it IS a dependency for testing. We probably ought not let users skip the qapi tests just because they don't have the perl requirement met.

(And, separately, the Fedora package should list this as a builddep, but that's not an issue for here.)
