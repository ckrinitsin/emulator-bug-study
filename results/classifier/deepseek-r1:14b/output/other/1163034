linux-user mode can't handle guest setting a very small RLIMIT_AS (hangs running gnutls28, coreutils configure check code)

Please look at
https://code.launchpad.net/~costamagnagianfranco/+archive/costamagnagianfranco-ppa/+packages
and
https://code.launchpad.net/~costamagnagianfranco/+archive/costamagnagianfranco-ppa/+build/4457434

I cannot make gnutls28 build on armhf, I suspect a builder problem
