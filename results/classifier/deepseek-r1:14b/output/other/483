qemu doesn't process -object secret when read from a config file
Description of problem:
Qemu doesn't process -object secret lines when read from a config file.  This results in the new spice password-secret option failing with error: No secret with id '\<theid\>'
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a password file
```
printf "password" > passfile.pw
```
2. Start qemu with command line options and also write to a config file
```
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -object secret,id=spicepwd,format=raw,file=passfile.pw \
  -spice port=5901,password-secret=spicepwd \
  -writeconfig qemu.cfg
```
3. Optional: Connect using spice client and password: "password"
4. Exit qemu and cat qemu.cfg and verify it looks okay with equivalent options to what was specified on the command line
5. Now attempt to start qemu and read the options using the config file
```
qemu-system-x86_64 -readconfig qemu.cfg
```
6. This fails with an error:
```
qemu-system-x86_64: No secret with id 'spicepwd'
```
