Description of problem:
warning: Deprecated CPU topology (considered invalid): Unsupported clusters parameter mustn't be specified as 1
VM does not start

What I've tried so far to fix:

- Removed the offending `clusters="1"` parameter in the XML, both via virsh edit and virt-manager but the sucker comes back every time!

- Creating a completely new VM from scratch, just keeping the qcow2 for Windows. What happens then is funny: The initial setup goes well. Machine type automatically gets set to q35 version 9.0. After setting up my cores (pinning) for the VM (7C/14T for the VM 1C/2T for host), there is no "clusters" parameter anymore. So the first start went well. After a RESTART of the whole host machine and subsequent launch of the VM guess what happened? The "clusters" thing is back in full swing.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create Windows 11 VM with virt-manager
2. Try to do core pinning and setting up the following in virt manager before
- Copy CPU configuration from host (host-passthrough)
- Manually set CPU structure via GUI to 1 Socket, 7 Cores, 2 Threads on an 8 Core (in my case 11900k)
3. Observe result in XML being: 
 `<topology sockets="1" dies="1" clusters="1" cores="7" threads="2"/>`

Again, the "clusters" entry leads to the VM not starting. Removing it doesn't work, it comes back straight away. I tried in virt-manager as well as with virsh edit.
Additional information:
