Qemu-5.1.0 build from source man entry not found

Hello together,

i build qemu-5.1.0 from source on centos 8 withe the following command:

../configure --prefix=/usr --target-list=x86_64-softmmu,x86_64-linux-user

make -j4

make install

The build and the installation finished successfully. But when i try the command

man qemu-system-x86_64

i got the message "No manual entry found". What i do wrong ?

Best regards
Damian
