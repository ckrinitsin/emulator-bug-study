ecovec.c:66: buffer too small by one.

[qemu-2.1.2/roms/u-boot/board/renesas/ecovec/ecovec.c:66]: (error) Buffer is accessed out of bounds.

    sprintf(env_mac, "%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X",
        mac[0], mac[1], mac[2], mac[3], mac[4], mac[5]);

but

    char env_mac[17];

and 18 into 17 won't go. Suggest increase size of env_mac.
