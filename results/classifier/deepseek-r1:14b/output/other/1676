Signed release tarball for 8.0.2 is missing
Description of problem:
Hi! I package QEMU for Arch Linux. I usually rely on the signed tarballs (which are also linked to from the website).
For [8.0.2](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/tags/v8.0.2) there does not seem to be a signed tarball though.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Try to update to 8.0.2 using a signed tarball
2. Find no signed tarball in https://download.qemu.org/
