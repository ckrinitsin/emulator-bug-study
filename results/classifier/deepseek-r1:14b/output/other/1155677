snapshot=on fails with non file-based storage

The snapshot=on option doesn't work with an nbd block device:

/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 \
[...]
    -device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi \
    -drive file=nbd:localhost:61930,snapshot=on,format=raw,id=hd0,if=none \
    -device scsi-hd,drive=hd0 \
[...]

gives the error:

qemu-system-x86_64: -drive file=nbd:localhost:61930,snapshot=on,format=raw,id=hd0,if=none: could not open disk image nbd:localhost:61930: No such file or directory

If you remove the snapshot=on flag, it works (although that of course means that the block device is writable which we don't want).

Previously reported here:

and I can confirm this still happens in qemu 1.4.0.
