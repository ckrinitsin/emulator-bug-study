Can't write to 9p shared folder with qemu 2.9.0

When running a virtual machine with qemu 2.9.0 with this parameter for sharing a folder:

-virtfs local,id=fsdev1,path=$HOME/git,security_model=none,mount_tag=git

then the folder is shared to the VM but in some subfolders I can't delete files. The guest system then reports that the file, I want to delete, is "no file or folder".

I've downgraded to 2.8.0 now, which re-enables deleting my files.

Is this a known bug which will be fixed with a future version?
