Raspberry Pi: Unable to start raspios bookworm
Description of problem:
I am able to start RaspiOS bullseye (2023-05-03-raspios-bullseye-arm64-lite) in both, the rpi3 and rpi4 configurations, by first extracting the DTB and the kernel from the downloaded image (see the command lines).

When I attempt to start RaspiOS bookworm (2024-03-15-raspios-bookworm-arm64-lite), I only get the following messages on the host's terminal:

```
usbnet: failed control transaction: request 0x8006 value 0x600 index 0x0 length 0xa

```
