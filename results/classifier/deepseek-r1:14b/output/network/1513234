Cannot ping guest from host after closing laptop lid, and re-opening

I am running Ubuntu 15.10 (this issue also exists on 15.04) x64. Desktop environment to re-produce is either GNOME 3.16 or OpenBox-3. 

I have a Windows 8.1 VM that I run with QEMU and I will work out of that for my job most of the day. When I am going to leave I like to just close my laptop lid, come home, and then get back at it. Unfortunately whenever I get home and open back up my laptop, I can no longer RDP into my VM and can no longer ping it from the host.

If I open up Virt-Manager I can see the desktop via the Console page but cannot RDP into it with FreeRDP (I use FreeRDP all day on this machine so I know this works fine). 

If I use the Console tab to login to the Windows VM again, I notice that I can ping the host from the guest and am connected to the internet. Just can't seem to communicate with the VM via its IP anymore.

I have a NIC NAT virtual card and am using a Bridge
