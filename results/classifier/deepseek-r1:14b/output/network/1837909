This seems to be related to use of AI_ADDRCONFIG in qemu-sockets.c inet_parse_connect_saddr, dropping it fixes the test. 'man getaddrinfo' makes it sound like AI_ADDRCONFIG requires the host to have a non-loopback ipv4 or ipv6 address available

This host setup may seem niche, but it is what the 'mock' RPM build tool has by default. In Fedora we run the test suite during the RPM build, so the failing test causes a bit of pain for certain workflows
