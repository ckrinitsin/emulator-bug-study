[feature request] bind nat (-net user) to other interface (like eth0:2)

-net user mode is very nice because it does not require any changes in host system. However if host system has muplitple IPs You cant use it, or even switch to another. Qemu should be able to "bind" to eth0:1 eth0:2 so that outgoing traffic uses this interface and thus other IP.
