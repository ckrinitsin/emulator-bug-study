qemu can't resolve ::1 when no network is available

I'm not sure if this is a qemu thing or a getaddrinfo/glibc thing, or
even just something about my laptop.  However we have a test failure
in nbdkit which only occurs when my laptop is not connected to wifi or
other networking.  It boils down to:

  $ qemu-img info --image-opts "file.driver=nbd,file.host=::1,file.port=1234"
  qemu-img: Could not open 'file.driver=nbd,file.host=::1,file.port=1234': addre
ss resolution failed for ::1:1234: Address family for hostname not supported

In a successful case it should connect to a local NBD server on port
1234, but if you don't have that you will see:

  qemu-img: Could not open 'file.driver=nbd,file.host=::1,file.port=1234': Faile
d to connect socket: Connection refused

I can ‘ping6 ::1’ fine.

It also works if I replace ‘::1’ with ‘localhost6’.

My /etc/hosts contains:

127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
