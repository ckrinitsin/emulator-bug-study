file transfer over cifs to 64bit guest corrupts large files

qemu 4.0 compiled fom source.
vm called by
qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu qemu64 -smp 4 -m 4G -drive file=/data/images/slack14.2_64bit_test.qcow2,format=qcow2 -cdrom /mnt/smb1/slackware/iso/slackware64-14.2-install-dvd.iso -boot c -net nic,macaddr=02:00:00:11:11:17,model=i82551 -net bridge,br=br0 -enable-kvm -k en-gb -display vnc=:3 -monitor telnet:localhost:7103,server,nowait,nodelay

copying large files eg 2.4gb or reading them on a cifs mount in the guest causes corruption every time. For smaller files 40-60mb corruption is more than 50% of the time. tested by md5sum on cifs server, or on host machine vs. on guest vm.
corruption is seen only with 64bit guest using cifs with i82551 emulated network device
ie. 32bit guest using cifs with i82551 emulated network device gives no corruption.

changing the emulated device to vmxnet3 removes the data corruption (see below)

qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu qemu64 -smp 4 -m 4G -drive file=/data/images/slack14.2_64bit_test.qcow2,format=qcow2 -cdrom /mnt/smb1/slackware/iso/slackware64-14.2-install-dvd.iso -boot c -net nic,macaddr=02:00:00:11:11:17,model=vmxnet3 -net bridge,br=br0 -enable-kvm -k en-gb -display vnc=:3 -monitor telnet:localhost:7103,server,nowait,nodelay

this corruption is repeatable. ie. I created new vm, call using top example, installed 64bit linux, mounted cifs share and copied 2.4gb file to /tmp then run md5sum "filecopied"
the md5sum is different every time. copy same file to the host, or to a 32bit guest with the same virtual network device and bridge and md5sums are correct. The host pysical network adapter is
