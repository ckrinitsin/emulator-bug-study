QEMU crashes on ARMv7 since at least commit 493c9b19
Description of problem:
I'm trying to build QEMU for Android, Arm64 versions work well, but **Armv7** builds began to crash nearly since this series of commits (QEMU 7.2.50), related to 'TCG_TARGET_HAS_direct_jump' removal by @rth7680.
More precisely, this commit still works:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/82df11e78d0baef7ffb7e7933c6fb830ffed087c

and this one crashes:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/493c9b19a7fb7f387c4fcf57d3836504d5242bf5

(I tracked commits of 'tcg' subfolder and didn't bisect finer, but it's possible if needed).

Both qemu-system-x86_64 and qemu-system-i386 emulators crash.

**The crash is related to translation buffer size** : if I don't specify "-accel tcg,thread=single **,tb-size=256** ", the machine works.

The problem is that I can not run debugger on a phone, and crash dump does not show any useful information, just "segfault" reason ("Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV), code 2 (SEGV_ACCERR), fault addr 0xe19b8000").

Even more, the Linux starts and runs, but it crashes only when I'm trying to run the GIMP, between splash screen and main interface appearance.

I know that 1) Android is not officially supported and 2) 32-bit hosts were considered deprecated recently, but maybe it's possible to do something with these crashes?

Recent master (https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/5692a39f329413a00020a61fff95aff6b9884a73) doesn't work as well.
All 8.0.x Arm64 builds are runnable.

Thanks in advance.
