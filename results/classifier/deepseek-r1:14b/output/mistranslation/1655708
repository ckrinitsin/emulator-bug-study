target/ppc/int_helper.c:2806: strange expression ?

target/ppc/int_helper.c:2806:25: warning: ‘*’ in boolean context, suggest ‘&&’ instead [-Wint-in-bool-context]

Source code is

       zone_digit = (i * 2) ? b->u8[BCD_DIG_BYTE(i * 2)] >> 4 : zone_lead;

Which I read as

       zone_digit = (i * 2) ? (b->u8[BCD_DIG_BYTE(i * 2)] >> 4) : zone_lead;

so I think the compiler warning is for the i * 2 lhs of the ?.

I am not sure what to suggest as a bugfix.
