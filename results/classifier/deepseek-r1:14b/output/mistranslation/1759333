Illegal Instruction with HVF when encountering SSE instructions in the emulator

The latest version of QEMU doesn't seem to support emulated SSE instructions with HVF acceleration on macOS.
The decoder will treat SSE instructions as invalid, get the instruction sizes wrong and quickly crash the guest OS because of illegal instructions.
After having a quick look at target/i386/hvf/x86_decode.c, it seems that SSE instruction emulation isn't implemented in the current version of the x86 emulator.

A way to reproduce the issue is to run a macOS 10.13 guest with HVF acceleration enabled, this will crash once it's loading up the GUI.
