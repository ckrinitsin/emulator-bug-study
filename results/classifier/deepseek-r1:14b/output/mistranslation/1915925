ARM semihosting HEAPINFO results wrote to wrong address

This affects latest development branch of QEMU.

According to the ARM spec of the HEAPINFO semihosting call:

https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100863/0300/Semihosting-operations/SYS-HEAPINFO--0x16-?lang=en

> the PARAMETER REGISTER contains the address of a pointer to a four-field data block.

However, QEMU treated the PARAMETER REGISTER as pointing to a four-field data block directly.

Here is a simple program that can demonstrate this problem: https://github.com/iNvEr7/qemu-learn/tree/newlib-bug/semihosting-newlib

This code links with newlib with semihosting mode, which will call the HEAPINFO SVC during crt0 routine. When running in QEMU (make run), it may crash the program either because of invalid write or memory curruption, depending on the compiled program structure.
