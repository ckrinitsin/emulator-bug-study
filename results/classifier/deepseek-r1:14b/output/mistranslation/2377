Debootstrapping debian-bullseye arm64 segfaults with qemu >=8.1
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use qemu >= 8.1 (version <= 8.0.x work well)
2. Install `debootstrap` package
3. Run `sudo debootstrap --arch=arm64 bullseye root11-arm64`

This fails to chroot into the system being debootstrapped:

```
$ sudo debootstrap --arch=arm64 bullseye root11-arm64
...
W: Failure trying to run: chroot "/home/3/root11" /sbin/ldconfig
W: See /home/3/root11/debootstrap/debootstrap.log for details
$ tail -n2 /home/3/root11/debootstrap/debootstrap.log
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
/usr/share/debootstrap/functions: line 1092:  3869 Segmentation fault      chroot "/home/3/root11" "$@"
```
Additional information:
Failure happens only when debootstrapping "bullseye" with "arm64" architecture.
Older (e.g. <= "buster") and newer (e.g. > "bookworm") distros are deboostrapped OK.
Other (e.g. "armhf" and others) architectures are debootstrapped OK.

Qemu version <8.1 (e.g. 8.0.5 I use in Gentoo or versions in Debian <= bookworm) don't have the bug.

Originally faced the issue with Gentoo host. Recently rechecked with Debian Trixie host.
