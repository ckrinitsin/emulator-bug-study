PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA in Windows 7 x64.
Description of problem:
When trying to install Windows 7, it always crashes with PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA. This also impacts Windows 8.1, but crashes when it tries to start up the installation disc.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create A VM with the Windows 7 installation disc inside the cdrom.
2. Go through the installation
3. At some point, it will pull a blue screen with a PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA. (around expanding windows files or completing installation)
Additional information:
It looks like this bsod is relating to some non-canonical (illegal) virtual address being referenced. (It's just my guess based on the stop code)
