rdhpr %htstate unimplemented in translator
Description of problem:
I accidentally mixed up a copy of T1 and T2 sun4v firmwares and was able to trigger the following TCG assert ``tcg_reg_alloc_mov: Assertion `ts->val_type == TEMP_VAL_REG' failed.`` upon boot.

Having discovered my mistake I was expecting the guest to crash at some point but without triggering an
assert.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download the attached file bug.tar.gz and extract it

2. Apply the following diff to update the UART address for the T2 firmware

```
diff --git a/hw/sparc64/niagara.c b/hw/sparc64/niagara.c
index ccad2c43a3..7af64bd50f 100644
