qemu-io: the 'map' command hangs on the fuzzed image

Sequence:
 1. Unpack the attached archive, make a copy of test.img
 2. Put copy.img and backing_img.vdi in the same directory
 3. Execute

qemu-io copy.img -c map

Result: qemu-io processes part of the image and then hangs loading 100% of CPU time.
