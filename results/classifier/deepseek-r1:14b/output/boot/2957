qemu-system-riscv32: Some ROM regions are overlapping
Description of problem:
Booting the image produces:
```
qemu-system-riscv32: Some ROM regions are overlapping
These ROM regions might have been loaded by direct user request or by default.
They could be BIOS/firmware images, a guest kernel, initrd or some other file loaded into guest memory.
Check whether you intended to load all this guest code, and whether it has been built to load to the correct addresses.

The following two regions overlap (in the memory address space):
  output/images/fw_jump.elf ELF program header segment 1 (addresses 0x0000000000000000 - 0x00000000000278cc)
  mrom.reset (addresses 0x0000000000001000 - 0x0000000000001028)
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. `make qemu_riscv32_virt_defconfig`
2. `make`
3. `qemu-system-riscv32 \
-M virt -nographic \
-bios output/images/fw_jump.elf \
-kernel output/images/Image \
-append "root=/dev/vda ro" \
-drive file=output/images/rootfs.ext2,format=raw,id=hd0 \
-device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0 \
-netdev user,id=net0 -device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0`
Additional information:
Changing `-bios output/images/fw_jump.elf` to `-bios output/images/fw_jump.bin` or `-bios output/images/fw_dynamic.bin` resolves the issue.
