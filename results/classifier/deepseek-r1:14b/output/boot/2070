TCG acceleration + EDK2  + Secure Boot hangs on boot since qemu 8.2
Description of problem:
Since qemu 8.2, using TCG acceleration in combination with EDK2-OVMF UEFI Secure Boot firmware hangs on boot. qemu freezes and keeps a full CPU core busy at 100% while it hangs. The issue does not occur when using KVM acceleration. It also does not occur when not using EDK2-OVMF UEFI firmware. It also does not occur when using the non secure boot EDK2-OVMF UEFI firmware.
Steps to reproduce:
1. `git clone https://github.com/systemd/mkosi`
2. `cd mkosi`
3. `bin/mkosi --tools-tree=default --tools-tree-distribution=arch --qemu-kvm=no --qemu-firmware=uefi --debug -f qemu`
