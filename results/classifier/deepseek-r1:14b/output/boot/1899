AArch64: Wrong SCR_EL3 after turning on secondary cores via PSCI
Description of problem:
The system fails to boot when using "direct kernel boot" with EL3 enabled. After the guest OS enables secondary cores via PSCI, those have an incorrectly set up `SCR_EL3`. When the OS then executes an intruction which traps into (QEMU provided fake) EL3, the core ends up in an endless loop of "Undefined Instruction" exceptions.

This is nicely visible with `-serial stdio -append "earlycon=pl011,0x9000000 console=/dev/ttyAMA0" -d int`:

Steps to reproduce:
1. `qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt,secure=on -cpu max -smp 1 -kernel linux` works
2. `qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt,secure=on -cpu max -smp 2 -kernel linux` does not
Additional information:
The setup for `SCR_EL3` is done by `do_cpu_reset` in hw/arm/boot.c, but this is only called on full system reset. The PSCI call ends up in `arm_set_cpu_on_async_work` (target/arm/arm-powerctl.c) which calls `cpu_reset`. This clears `SCR_EL3` to the architectural reset value, not the one needed for direct kernel boot.

`arm_set_cpu_on_async_work` has code for `SCR_HCE`, but none of the other flags handled by `do_cpu_reset`. It would probably work after copying all of `do_cpu_reset` into `arm_set_cpu_on_async_work`, but that seems wrong. I prepared a patch which makes `do_cpu_reset` public such that `arm_set_cpu_on_async_work` can call it (works here), but I'm not sure whether that's the right way.
