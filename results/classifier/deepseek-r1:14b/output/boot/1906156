Host OS Reboot Required, for Guest kext to Load (Fully)

Hi,

Finding this one a bit odd, but I am loading a driver (kext) in a macOS guest ... and it works, on the first VM (domain) startup after a full / clean host OS boot (or reboot). However, if I even reboot the guest OS, then the driver load fails => can be "corrected" by a full host OS reboot (which seems very extreme).

Is this a known issue, and/or is there a workaround?

FYI, running,
QEMU emulator version 5.0.0 (Debian 1:5.0-5ubuntu9.1)

This is for a macOS guest, on a Linux host.

Thanks!
