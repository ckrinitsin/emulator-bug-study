qemu-2.12.1 crashes when running malicious bootloader.

Running specific bootloader on Qemu causes fatal error and 
hence SIGABRT in /qemu-2.12.1/tcg/tcg.c on line 2684.

Bootloader binary code is included in attachments.
The code was generated by assembling a valid bootloader, then
appending random-bytes from file `/dev/urandom` to the binary file.
