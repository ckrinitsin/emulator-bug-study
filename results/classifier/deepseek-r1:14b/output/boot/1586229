seabios hell

getting weird annoying seabios hell and not sure how to fix it.

ok.

there IS a SEA-BIOS. There IS a way in.

-I found it by mistake.(and yall need to move the BIOS key...its in the wrong place)

I was tryng to boot Yosemite to re-install. I mashed the key too early and it wanted to boot the hard drive.

Apparently the bios loads AFTER the hard drive wants to boot, not BEFORE it.And it will ONLY load when booting a hard disk.

..Booting hard disk...[mash F8 here but let go and wait]
eventually will want to load the OS and clear the screen[mash F8 again]

--Youre in!

Its tiny, like a mini award bios but youre in! 
-Change anything HERE, though...and kiss booting a cd goodbye!

Im trying to diagnose a black screen, seems related to seabios, not the vga driver.

-mayhaps wants to boot hard disk but in fact its not bootable as the installer hung(and often unices install bootloader late in process)?

I cant boot the disc to reinstall to tell. But I have a few dos iso lying around...hmmm.
