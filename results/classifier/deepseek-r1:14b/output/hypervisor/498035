qemu hangs on shutdown or reboot (XP guest)

When I shut down or reboot my Windows XP guest, about half the time, it hangs at the point where it says "Windows is shutting down...".  At that point qemu is using 100% of one host CPU, about 85% user, 15% system.  (Core 2 Quad 2.66GHz)

This is the command line I use to start qemu:

qemu-system-x86_64 -hda winxp.img -k en-us -m 2048 -smp 2 -vnc :3100 -usbdevice tablet -boot c -enable-kvm &
