AMD Ryzen 9950x with -smp option yields "warning: This family of AMD CPU doesn't support hyperthreading"
Description of problem:
When using the above -smp option (`-smp 32,sockets=1,dies=1,clusters=1,cores=16,threads=2`), which should be valid for the Ryzen 9950X 16 cores / 32 threads CPU, QEMU prints:
```
qemu-system-x86_64: warning: This family of AMD CPU doesn't support hyperthreading(2). Please configure -smp options properly or try enabling topoext feature.
```
This is unexpected.  This CPU should support hyperthreading out of the box, it seems.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run command above on Ryzen 9950X or similar CPU.
