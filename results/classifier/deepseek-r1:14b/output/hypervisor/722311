Segmentation fault if started without -enable-kvm parameter

I start qemu (Linux) from the same USB memory stick on several computers. Up to and including qemu 0.12.5, I could use or not use qemu's "-enable-kvm" command line parameter as appropriate for the hardware, and qemu would run. In contrast, qemu 0.13.0 and 0.14.0 segfault if started without "-enable-kvm". I get a black window appearing for fractions of a second, disappearing immediately, and then the error message "Segmentation fault".

Hardware: Pentium 4, and Core 2 Duo.
Command line: either "qemu" or "qemu -enable-kvm" (after manually loading the kvm-intel module on the Core 2 Duo).
Reproducible: always.
