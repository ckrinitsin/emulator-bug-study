watchdog doesn't bring down the VM

Qemu-kvm version : QEMU emulator version 1.5.3 (qemu-kvm-1.5.3-105.el7), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Billard

Qemu version: Virsh command line tool of libvirt 1.2.17

I have the VM stuck in bios (efi shell), but i don't see the watchdog in the host bringing it down?

Couple of questions:

1. Does the watchdog functionality requires the driver in adminvm to trigger the reload? or qemu detects it in the host and causes the reload.

2. Does this work reliably? I have seen cases where in i have the watchdog daemon in the VM shut, still don't see the VM going down (I put the action in the XML file as power off)

Thanks
