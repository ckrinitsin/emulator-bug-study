Data corruption after block migration (LV->LV)

We quite frequently use the live block migration feature to move VM's between nodes without downtime. These sometimes result in data corruption on the receiving end. It only happens if the VM is actually doing I/O (doesn't have to be all that much to trigger the issue).

We use logical volumes and each VM has two disks.  We use cache=none for all VM disks.

All guests use virtio (a mix of various Linux distro's and Windows 2008R2).

We currently have two stacks in use and have seen the issue on both of them:

Fedora - qemu-kvm 0.13
Scientific Linux 6.2 (RHEL derived) - qemu-kvm package 0.12.1.2

Even though we don't run the most recent versions of KVM I highly suspect this issue is still unreported and that filing a bug is therefore appropriate. (There doesn't seem to be any similar bug report in launchpad or RedHat's bugzilla and nothing related in change logs, release notes and  git commit logs.)

I have no idea where to look or where to start debugging this issue, but if there is any way I can provide useful debug information please let me know.
