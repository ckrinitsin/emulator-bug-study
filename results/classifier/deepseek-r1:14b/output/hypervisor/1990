qemu ASSERT [ArmCpuDxe] DefaultExceptionHandler.c:333 on Mac M3
Description of problem:
I am installing Podman 4.7.2 and `podman-machine` uses `qemu-system-aarch64` to boot up an embedded coreos image to run containers.
With the new Apple M3 hardware, I am experiencing a QEMU assertion failure almost all of the time.

`ASSERT [ArmCpuDxe] /home/kraxel/projects/qemu/roms/edk2/ArmPkg/Library/DefaultExceptionHandlerLib/AArch64/DefaultExceptionHandler.c(333): ((BOOLEAN)(0==1))`

I have been unable to get the full crash output - I didn't figure out how to resize the console any larger, and I tried a couple different ways to hook the console up to qemu stdout without any success. (since the kernel command line parameters are not passed in, but instead the image uses a bootloader)

I believe this is the same issue I experience, but with a better capture of the crash:

Steps to reproduce:
1. Use Mac M3 (Max in my case)
2. Install Podman
3. Run `podman-machine init`
4. Run `podman-machine start --log-level=debug`
5. Crash (almost certainly)
