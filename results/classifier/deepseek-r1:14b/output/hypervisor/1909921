 Raspberry Pi 4 qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0xffff87709b0e

Hello,

I have a Raspberry Pi 4 with an ESXi hypervisor installed on it (ESXi ARM Edition).
I created a CentOS 7 VM on it and I'm using a Docker container which is running qemu inside it.

This container is a Debian Bullseye OS and I'm using qemu-i386 to start my application inside it.
The error given by qemu is the following :

qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0xffff9d5f9b0e
qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0xffff82f29b0e

(The pc= value is always different, I guess it is randomly generated).

My qemu version is : qemu-i386 version 5.1.0 (Debian 1:5.1+dfsg-4+b1)

Could you please help me? Why am I facing this error?

Feel free to ask any questions regarding this matter in order to find a solution to it!
