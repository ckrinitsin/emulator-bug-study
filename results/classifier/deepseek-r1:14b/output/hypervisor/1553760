NUMA node binding are not supported by this QEMU

I read https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+bug/1417937/, but I don't understand why it was only fixed on Ubunto.
I'm running on Debian 8, openstack kilo, and trying to launch a VM with numa pinning.
Is it not possible to build qemu with CONFIG_NUMA enabled for Debian where libnuma is present?
