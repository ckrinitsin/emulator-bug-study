Regression: QEMU 4.1.0 qxl and KMS resoluiton only 4x10

Host is Arch Linux.  linux 5.2.13, qemu 4.1.0.

Guest is Arch Linux Sept 2019 ISO.  linux 5.2.11.

Have replicated this both on a system using amdgpu and one using integrated ASPEED graphics.

Downgrading from 4.1.0 to 4.0.0 works as usual, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyMdcYwOCvY

Going back to 4.1.0 reproduces, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3nGG2Mk6i0

4.1.0 displays fine until KMS kicks in.
