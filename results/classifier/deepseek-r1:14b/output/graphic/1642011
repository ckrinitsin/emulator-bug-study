Mouse wheel events not forwarded to guest using GTK display

Using QEMU 2.7.0 with KVM enabled, when I launch the guest without options (using the default of gtk), the mouse wheel events are not propagated to the guest.

When I start qemu using -display sdk, mouse wheel events are properly forwarded.

I can determine that the guest is not receiving mouse wheel events by doing cat /dev/input/by-id/usb-QEMU_QEMU_USB_Mouse_42-event-mouse. When I scroll the wheel, no output is printed to the screen.

The guest is ChromiumOS.

The command line is:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 2G -smp 4 -vga cirrus -usbdevice mouse -pidfile /tmp/kvm.pid -chardev pipe,id=control_pipe,path=/tmp/kvm.pipe -serial file:/tmp/kvm.serial -mon chardev=control_pipe -net nic,model=virtio -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:9222-:22 -drive file=chromiumos/src/build/images/amd64-generic/latest/chromiumos_qemu_image.bin,index=0,media=disk,cache=unsafe

(Most of that invocation sets up Linux fifos for various and nefarious purposes and can be profitably ignored).
