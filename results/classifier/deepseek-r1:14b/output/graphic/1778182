qemu-system-aarch64 shows black framebuffer window on minimal bare metal example on SDL but not on VNC

QEMU v2.12.0, Ubuntu 18.04 host.

Build QEMU and the bare metal image exactly as described at: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/revisions/85135/4 with:

Then cd into example 09_framebuffer.

Now if I do:

../../qemu/aarch64-softmmu/qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3 -kernel kernel8.img -serial stdio

the SDL window shows up black.

However, if I use VNC:

../../qemu/aarch64-softmmu/qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3 -kernel kernel8.img -serial stdio -vnc :1
vinagre :5901

an image of Homer Simpson appears as expected.

Therefore, I think this must be a QEMU / SDL bug instead of the repository, since we get different behaviors with `-vnc` and with SDL.
