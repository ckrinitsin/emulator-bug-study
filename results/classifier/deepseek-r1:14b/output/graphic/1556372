Superfluous popup on Cocoa to verify quit, cannot be disabled.

This patch severely reduces the quality of life for developers using QEMU in a rapid Edit-Compile-Test cycle.
Any method of quitting QEMU via the UI triggers this dialogue, whose default option is "cancel" -- necessitating the use of the mouse to click "Confirm".

This dialogue cannot be disabled by any flag, and is highly annoying. Recommend a flag to disable this confirmation, or in fact disable it by default and enable it with a flag.
