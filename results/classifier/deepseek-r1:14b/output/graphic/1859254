host window size does not change when guest video screen size changes while moving host window

When QEMU is emulating a legacy text mode, then switches to a VESA mode, if you happen to be moving the host window while the switch is made, the host window never changes size.  The emulated size does, but the host window doesn't.

For example, at Legacy boot up, the screen mode is mode 03 at 80x25.  Then when the GUEST OS changes the screen to a VESA mode, say 1024x768x16, normally the host window will change to that size to accommodate the new emulated screen size.

However, if you happen to be moving the host window at the time of the screen mode change, the host window doesn't change in size to accommodate the new screen size.  

I am using:
  QEMU for Windows, version 4.1.0-11789
  Host: Windows 10 (latest updates)
  Emulating: Intel x64, Legacy BIOS
Command line:
"c:\program files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe" -m 256 -drive file=C:\fysos64.img,format=raw,if=ide,media=disk,index=0 -parallel file:para.txt -boot c -d guest_errors -vga std -smp cpus=4 -rtc base=localtime,clock=host,driftfix=slew -net none -monitor stdio

I tried different -vga settings:
   -vga std
   -vga cirrus
   -vga vmware
Each did the same thing.

[ Side note (possible error in documentation):

If you need an image to test with, I have been using www.fysnet.net/temp/fysos64.zip (2meg zipped/10meg raw).  It starts in Legacy BIOS/Hardware mode 3, then switches to VESA 1024x768x16 within a few seconds, so be ready to move the HOST window when the mode changes.

I do not have a Linux box to test with, so unknown if this is only an issue with the Windows version or not.
