QEMU 2.12 Running Problem in Windows 7 Installation

QEMU Version: 2.12 (Binary installer qemu-w64-setup-20180424.exe  from Stefan Weil's website so I am not sure I should report it to Weil by email or by this bug report system.)
Host System: Windows 7 64bit
Guest System: 9front 6350 (Codename“CONTENTS, MAINTAINED, STABLE”, Release 2018/02/02)

QEMU Command:
qemu-system-x86_64 -usb -device usb-mouse -hda plan9.qcow2.img -cdrom 9front-6350.iso -boot d

QEMU warning: 
(qemu-system-x86_64.exe:8844): GdkPixbuf-WARNING **: Cannot open pixbuf loader module file 'D:\qemu\lib\gdk-pixbuf-2.0\2.10.0\loaders.cache': No such file or directory

This likely means that your installation is broken.
Try running the command
  gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders > D:\qemu\lib\gdk-pixbuf-2.0\2.10.0\loaders.cache
to make things work again for the time being.

(qemu-system-x86_64.exe:8844): Gtk-WARNING **: Could not find the icon 'window-minimize-symbolic-ltr'. The 'hicolor' theme was not found either, perhaps you need to install it.
