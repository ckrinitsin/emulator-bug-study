Netbeans failing to start after netbeans splash comes up. No netbeans window is being drawn.
Problem can be reproduced.
It IS working with -vga qxl, so maybe there's a bug in std emulation.

output from netbeans log (more in attachement):

SEVERE [global]
java.lang.RuntimeException: failed to load system cursor: DnD.Cursor.CopyDrop : cannot load system cursor: CopyDrop.32x32
