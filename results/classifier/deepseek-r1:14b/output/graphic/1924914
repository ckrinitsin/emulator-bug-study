Running sway in a QEMU VM results in a GPU hang of the guest (virtio-gpu driver)

System is Arch Linux (guest and host OS).

Problem:

Basically, when using sway on a guest and running certain applications via Xwayland (on the guest), the GUI will freeze and won't be usable anymore, I can still ssh to the guest and run commands.

This is the command I use to run my guest:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cdrom ~/Downloads/linux/archlinux/archlinux-2021.04.01-x86_64.iso -m 4G -vga virtio -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22

This doesn't happen when I use X with i3-wm.
