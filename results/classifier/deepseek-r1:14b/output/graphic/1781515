Resolution switch leads to the screen/image being corrupted

I am currently using QEMU on a Arch Linux host, the guest OS is also Arch Linux.

The QEMU version is currently 2.12.0-2 packaged by Arch Linux, the command line I'm using to fire an Arch VM is:

$ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -hda archlinux.qcow2 -m 4G -smp 4

The problem I'm currently having is, after firing the VM and running startx I want to change the resolution to the native resolution, which is 1366x768 on my ThinkPad T450, however, after changing the resolution the image on the guest gets corrupted and it's impossible to see anything.

At this point I can only turn off the VM. The only workaround I found is to start the VM with -vga virtio.

The problem in this case occurs with -vga std which is the default video driver.
