qemu-kvm-spice spice server locks up when large user image is set

QEMU emulator version 2.0.0 (Debian 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.22), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

I have QEMU kvm spice installed, running a Windows 10 1511, freshly installed this morning, using VirtIO root volume, Ethernet, and QXL graphics through Spice. It successfully installed the latest updates, and installed Visual Studio 2010 Professional plus Service Pack 1 and updates.

Upon attempting to configure the following PNG as my account's user picture in the Settings control panel applet:

It added successfully, but then I noticed that Windows does not support alpha blended user pictures, and it blended it against white, so I quickly replaced it with the following:

Upon assigning that, with the other one still in the previous image buttons, Spice locked up completely. The VM was still running, as evidenced by a successful Remote Desktop session.

Do I need to replace my entire Qemu setup with a Git or hand built official version to verify that this isn't Ubuntu's fault?
