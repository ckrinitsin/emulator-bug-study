I don't sure what is the problem...

Here are my tested history
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install android-x86 on I7 desktop PCs with intel UHD GPU  - No leak.
Install android-x86 on I7 desktop PCs with NVIDIA GTX GPU series - No leak.
Install android-x86 on guest machine emulated skylake cpu with QEMU(+virt-gpu, virgl-renderer) - Leak
(HOST CPU - I5, INTEL UHD GPU)
Install android-x86 on guest machine emulated skylake cpu with QEMU(+virt-gpu, virgl-renderer) - Leak
(HOST CPU - I7, NVIDIA GTX GPU)

COMMON:
In case of NVIDIA GPU : check vram using nvidia-smi
In case of intel UHD GPU : check shared-vram using free cmd

We checked guest android-x86 system down when vram is full after performing many rotation

Is it virt-gpu driver's problem?

I hope someone can help me...

Thanks in advance!!
