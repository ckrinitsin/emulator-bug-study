x86_64 host curses interface: spacing/garbling

Environment:
Arch Linux x86_64, kernel 2.6.33, qemu 0.12.3

Steps to reproduce:
1. Have a host system running 64-bit Linux.
2. Start a qemu VM with the -curses flag.

Expected results:
Text displayed looks as it would on a real text-mode display, and VM is therefore usable.

Actual results:
Text displayed contains an extra space between characters, causing text to flow off the right and bottom sides of the screen. This makes the curses interface unintelligible.

The attached patch fixes this problem on 0.12.3 on my installation without changing behavior on a 32-bit machine.  I don't know enough of the semantics of console_ch_t to know if this is the "correct" fix or if there should be, say, an extra cast somewhere instead.
