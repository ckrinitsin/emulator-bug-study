Windows 7 guests hang on bootup when qxl video is used

I installed libvirt-bin and virt-manager on Ubuntu 16.04.  I created a new VM for Windows 7, basically with default settings, which includes qxl video..  The Windows boot process hangs with the "Starting Windows" animation.  CPU and disk I/O drop to zero, and it continues animating.... forever and ever...  It never finishes booting.  But it doesn't fully "hang" either: the animation continues to animate.

As a workaround, I set the video mode to "Cirrus" and then Windows boots but it is slow and limited.  And also apparently to be avoided:

I can confirm it's only when qxl is enabled, because if I switch from Cirrus back to qxl, it hangs again - and going back to Cirrus again "fixes" the problem.

This issue is also reported elsewhere:
