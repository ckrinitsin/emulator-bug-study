Under KVM recommendations

PCI passthrough recommendations

If you are running PCI passthrough with 16.04.x KVM and with the stock QEMU package, update to the QEMU package that have DDW support. If you do not update the package, you will hit data integrity issues as soon as I/O is started on the adapter.

The package is available at: https://launchpad.net/~ibmpackages/+archive/ubuntu/ddw
