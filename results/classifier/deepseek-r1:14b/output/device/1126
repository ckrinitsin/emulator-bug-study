qemu-system-mipsel freezes for nanoMIPS in the semihosting mode
Description of problem:
In the current git master branch (SHA: 7b17a1a8) there is a problem with qemu-system-mipsel when trying to execute a simple hello.elf program in the semihosting mode for the nanoMIPS architecture. I.e. after executing the following command the terminal freezes: 
 ```
   $ ./qemu-system-mipsel -cpu I7200 -semihosting -nographic -kernel hello.elf
 ```
hello.elf file is generated using the nanoMIPS GNU Toolchain (https://github.com/MediaTek-Labs/nanomips-gnu-toolchain/releases).
The program regularly terminates with QEMU emulator version 6.0.1.
