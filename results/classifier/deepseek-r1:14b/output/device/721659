qemu-kvm-0.13.0 doesn't pass USB devices to the VM

I have the bug, similar to this one:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=583108
but under gentoo

When I add parameters -usb -usbdevice host:4348:5584, I see the following lines in console:

husb: config #1 need -1
USBDEVFS_DISCONNECT: No route to host
husb: open device 2.11
(...many repetitions of three above lines...)

All parameters (2.11) are verified with lsusb at host computer - parameters are correct

Error description is very confusing - I don't know what to check, what "config #1" mean, which route should be checked and how to check it.
