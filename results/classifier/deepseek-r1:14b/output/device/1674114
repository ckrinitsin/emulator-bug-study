Bad sectors when using MS-DOS 6.22

When I try to install DOS 6.22 in QEMU, I get many disk errors when the virtual disk is beeing partionized and formatted. When I later do a SCANDISK, I can see many bad sectors and file errors.

I have tested this with the following disk formats: qcow2, vmdk, raw.

I tested this on Windows 7 with the following command line and QEMU version:
qemu-system-i386 -name "Windows 3.11 WfW" -machine isapc -cpu 486 -boot order=adc -m 32 -soundhw sb16 -hda disk1.qcow2 -vga cirrus

qemu-system-i386 --version
QEMU emulator version 2.8.50 (v2.8.0-12557-g0bd1f6b1b2-dirty)

I then did a test with the linux version of qemu, which gave me the same results.
Command line: qemu-system-i386 -name "Windows 3.11 WfW" -machine isapc -cpu 486 -boot order=adc -m 32 -soundhw sb16 -hda disk1.qcow2 -vga cirrus -monitor stdout
Version: qemu-system-i386 --version

I also checked the disk image with qemu-img, with no results:

No errors were found on the image.
7986/8000 = 99.83% allocated, 0.20% fragmented, 0.00% compressed clusters
Image end offset: 523698176

Because I got the error with two different versions of QEMU, I think this is a general problem and not related to a specific distribution.

I have attached a zip file with screenshots of SCANDISK, which shows the disk errors.
