IDE HDD emulation random read/write errors

I unfortunately can’t give more tracks other than how to reproduce the bug, especially that the bug occurs randomly.

Basically, I’m trying to install DOS 6.22 on an emulated ISA machine, and it fails, DOS complaining about read or write error on drive C. Repeating the operation multiple time, I see it occurs at random stage, sometime even before it partitions the drive, sometime when it formats the drive, sometime when it copies the files from the floppy to the drive.

To test it, unpack the attached archive and execute `./run` from the extracted directory. The archive contains three raw floppy images for installing DOS 6.22, and a Bourne Shell script which invokes QEmu. Just press enter at any installation stage, the bug may occurs at any stage.

I tried with `cache=none` to be sure it’s not a cache issue, but its the same whatever the cache policy is.

Version and environment: using QEmu 3.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 on a 32 bits DELL Inspiron 9400 (not an emulation, that’s my real laptop).

For why I’m using QEmu for this: the installation proceeds with not error in VirtualBox, but I wanted to use QEmu to have a serial mouse which is not available with QEmu and to have finer control over the machine configuration ; VirtualBox although good, is more limited in that regard.
