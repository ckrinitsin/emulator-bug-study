[Feature Request] Automatic device configuration discovery

Would it be possible to have a script that enumerates the device tree of a Linux host and generates a qemu command line that would recreate it under emulation? The user would have to customize the arguments (for instance to point to disk image files), but it would take a lot of the guesswork out.

Similarly, is there information that can be gleaned from the kernel build config that would help with configuration?
