qemu does not pass sector size from physical devices to virtual devices

When passing a physical disk (i.e. a multipathed fcal volume in my case) with a 4k sector size as raw image to qemu (-drive file=/dev/mapper/hartebeest-sys,if=none,id=drive-virtio-disk0,boot=on,format=raw), the resulting virtual device has a sector size of 512b, rendering the partition table unusable!
