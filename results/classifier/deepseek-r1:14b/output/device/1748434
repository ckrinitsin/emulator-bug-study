Possibly wrong GICv3 behavior when secure enabled

I an tried arm-aarch64 interrupt routing to EL3, by SCR_EL3.FIQ=1. First I am started QEMU with secure=on and GICv3 support.
I programmed secure and non-secure timers and set-up appropriate interrupts.Secure timer to be GRP1_Secure and non-secure timer to be GRP1_NonSecure. ICC_PMR = 0xff. Then I switched CPU to EL1. 
With that setup no interrupt was delivered to PE. GIC interface showed that non secure IRQ is pending. ICC_PMR read at EL1 returns 0 (shall return value ((PMR_(el3) << 1) & 0xff) according to GIC specification.
Than I tried to increase interrupt priority mask  - so I set ICC_PMR = 0x7f (at EL3). Then I read at EL1 ICC_PMR=0xfe - (is shall be 0). With this setup IRQ of secure timer was taken at EL3, non secure timer didn't rise IRQ (as it is masked by PMR). 
I dig to qemu code and see wrong condition in file arm_gicv3_cpuif.c in function  icc_pmr_read(). This behavior is opposite of ARM specification.
