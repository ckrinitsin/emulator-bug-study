Keyboard input not working when the "-k en-us" argument is specified.

This bug occurs on qemu compiled with i386_softmmu and x86-64_softmmu on linux kernel 3.5.0.
Whenever I run qemu (both i386 and x86_64) to use the en-us language (even though it is the default), I get "Warning: no scancode found for keysym X" (X is an integer).
In the disk image I need qemu to run, I had a shell set up.  The shell doesn't register keyboard input when the '-k en-us' command line argument is set when running qemu. I did not have this problem with earlier versions of qemu.
