usb-host devices given by command line are routed incomplete to the guest

affected qemus: qemu-1.0, qemu-kvm-1.0, qemu and qemu-kvm master branches (older versions not tested)
affected guests: linux, windows
test hardware: standard usb key (or any other piece of USB hardware) that works perfectly when plugged in after guest bootup

Several Sequences have been tested:
- start qemu with  -readconfig /etc/ich9-ehci-uhci.cfg -device usb-tablet -device usb-host,bus=ehci.0
- start qemu with -readconfig /etc/ich9-ehci-uhci.cfg -device usb-tablet -S (to not start up the guest directly) + at the console prompt: "device_add usb-host" then "c" to start the guest.

For the linux guest, I get a usb device listed and detected as /dev/sdb when plugging it in at runtime. At startup linux does NOT detect it.
For the windows guest, I get a usb device listed and detected as "removable media" when plugging it in at runtime. At startup Windows does detect "something" that is listed in the device manager as Generic Mass Storage device, but with a yellow exclamation mark and there is no removable media listed in Explorer

If you need further testings, just let me know.
