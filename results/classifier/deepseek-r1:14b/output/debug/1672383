Slow Windows XP load after commit a9353fe897ca2687e5b3385ed39e3db3927a90e0

I've recently discovered, that in QEMU 2.8+ my Windows XP loading time has significantly worsened. In 2.7 it took 30-40 second to boot, but in 2.8 it became 2-2,5 minutes.

I've used Git bisect, and found out that the change happened after commit a9353fe897ca2687e5b3385ed39e3db3927a90e0, which, as far as I can tell from the commit message, handled race condition when invalidating breakpoint.

I've set a breakpoint in static void breakpoint_invalidate(CPUState *cpu, target_ulong pc), and here's a backtrace:
#0  cpu_breakpoint_insert (cpu=cpu@entry=0x555556a73be0, pc=144, 
    flags=flags@entry=32, breakpoint=breakpoint@entry=0x555556a7c670)

It seems that XP sets some breakpoints during it's load, and it leads to frequent TB flushes and slow execution.
