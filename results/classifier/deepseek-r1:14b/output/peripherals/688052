usb does not work 0.13.0

Hi all, I'm using both, debian lenny and debian squeeze.
I installed qemu-kvm (0.12.5) form debian repository but I got problem trying to pass a host usb device to the guest.

I compiled so the latest stable version (0.13.0) hoping that the problem was fixed.
It didn't help, the error I get is always:

usb_create: no bus specified, using "usb.0" for "usb-host" 

The command I use is

qemu-system-x86_64 -hda lenny_amd64_vergine.qcow2 -usbdevice host:002.007 -boot order=c

On internet I found this, it might help:

The guest is a simple debian lenny with 2.6.26 kernel.


I tried also to download the qemu development version but the download get interruped

git clone http://git.qemu.org/qemu.git
Cloning into qemu...

I attach more info about the host machine I'm testing on.
