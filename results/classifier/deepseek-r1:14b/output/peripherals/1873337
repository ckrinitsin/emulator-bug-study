Arrow keys press is double in some programs in Dos

Hello,
im trying to use Qemu for Dos machines.

 But there is problem with some programs that arrow key press is double in some problems. As advanced Filemanagers - Dos Navigator or File Wizard, same Scandisk.

 Its blocking to use such problem, unless you use Numlock key for it, but im used 25+ years to arrow keys and its bug.. I guess that it would mess with some games too.
