keyboard suddenly stops working in VM and problem persists until host reboot. All super-standard setup no funny stuff

I already had this with ubanto VM so I installed a centos one but then I type HDD password in VNC suddenly keyboard stops working forever. Kill qemu, stop qemu, start again ... same issue. Very strange. Problem in VNC, problem in vga std problem in spicec problem with options problem without options, SDL no SDL and nothing helps. dmesg only shows unhandled wrmsr like always .. so irrelevant. 

Must be problem with new kernel or nvidia driver mystery magic I suppose? But I had riced CK kernel before and no issue. Hardware didn't change. Nothing works, what is this? Can do sendkey 1 1 in console no issue. So why is all keyboard input dead in mid-operation? You see after reboot I open VM and no matter what VNC or spicec or SDL I input keyboard all normal then this! BAM all keyboard input gone! So in ubuntu I still had mouse so I used onscreen keyboard to enable SSH and then I didn't care. But now I have harddrive password, what can I do? Install different QEMU but I suppose problem with new kernel xorg stuff rather ... Can't change that! Help much appreciated.
