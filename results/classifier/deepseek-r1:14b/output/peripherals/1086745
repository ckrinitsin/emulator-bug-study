serial port data THRE comes too early

When using a serial port with a Linux guest (and host) and the application uses hardware handshake, this fails because the handling of TEMT and/or THRE is not operating properly in such cases.

As long as it takes _time_ for the 'real' port to output the data TEMT may not return true. After writing characters to a real port, the driver should timeout the transmission and after the total time expired, TEMT can be set.

Some applications i.e. with a simplex modem do: RTS_on, WRITE_data, repeat IOCTL(GET_LSR_INFO), RTS_off, READ_data.
At the moment this fails because very early in the transmission, GET_LSR_INFO returns true and the modem transmitter is switched off.

I looked in the source (git)  and found that 'char_transmit_time' is present. My skills fail to implement it myself.
I build and ran the latest git version and found it to fail as decribed above.  I hope someone can solve it.
