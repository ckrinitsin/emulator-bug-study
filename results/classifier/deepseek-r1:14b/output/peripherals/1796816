Wrong keyboard in QEMU Windows for OpenSUSE PowerPC

I am trying to run an OpenSUSE PowerPC Little Endian system under Microsoft Windows. I have an English UK keyboard. The keyboard is basically correct (I get a 'pound' sign when I press shift-3) but some of the keys are rendered incorrectly. The wrong keys are
\ renders as # (just right of left hand shift key)
| renders as ~ (shift-\)
' renders as ` (2 keys right of l)
@ renders as Â¬ (shift-')
# renders as ' (3 keys right of l)
~ renders as @ (shift-#)

QEMU command line was
>"\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-ppc64.exe" -hda opensuse.qcow2

OpenSUSE was installed from download.opensuse.org/ports/ppc/tumbleweed/iso/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-DVD-ppc64le-Current.iso .

I am running OpenSUSE in runlevel 3 (no X11).

I don't really know whether the problem is with QEMU, the Windows port of QEMU, or with OpenSUSE Tumbleweed.

This is with QEMU for Windows 3.0.0 from https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/
