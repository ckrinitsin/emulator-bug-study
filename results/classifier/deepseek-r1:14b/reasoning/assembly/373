Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user provided a list of categories and the bug report says: "Indentation should be done with spaces, not with TABs, in the ARM subsystem." 

First, I need to understand what each category means. Let's go through them one by one.

- **mistranslation**: This is about incorrect mapping from source to target architecture, maybe during assembly lowering. Doesn't seem relevant here.
- **assembly**: Relates to assembly code issues. The bug mentions indentation in the ARM subsystem, which might be part of the assembly code handling.
- **other**: For things that don't fit elsewhere.
- **device**, **graphic**, **socket**, **network**: These are hardware or protocol-related. Probably not about formatting.
- **KVM**, **boot**, **vnc**, **debug**, **files**, **permissions**, **performance**, **kernel**, **peripherals**, **hypervisor**: All these seem more related to system operations, virtualization, or specific functionalities rather than code style.

The bug is about using spaces instead of tabs for indentation in the ARM subsystem. This sounds like a coding style issue within QEMU's source code. Since the ARM subsystem likely deals with assembly lowering or code formatting during translation, the category might be **assembly**. Alternatively, it could fall under **other** if it's just about code style rather than functional issues.

But considering that indentation in assembly code is part of how the code is structured and translated, especially in the ARM context which involves specific assembly handling, **assembly** seems more appropriate.

The bug report pertains to coding style within the ARM subsystem, specifically regarding indentation. Since this relates to how code is formatted during assembly processing, it falls under **assembly**.

**Answer:** assembly
