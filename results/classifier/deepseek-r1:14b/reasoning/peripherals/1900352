Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned that there's no sound in the SPICE client when VNC is enabled. They're using Fedora32 with virt-manager, libvirt, and QEMU. 

So, the problem occurs when both SPICE and VNC are configured. Without VNC, sound works fine through SPICE. This makes me think that enabling VNC somehow interferes with SPICE's audio handling.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, network, etc. The issue is related to sound, which falls under peripherals because it's about input/output devices and their functionality. 

I don't think it's a translation or assembly issue since it's more about configuration between two graphical protocols. It's not directly about graphics handling (graphic category) but rather about the audio component.

So, the most appropriate category would be "peripherals" because sound is a peripheral device function that isn't working correctly when VNC is active.

The bug report involves no sound in the SPICE client when VNC is enabled. The issue relates to the interaction between the SPICE server and the VNC display, affecting audio routing. Since the problem pertains to the functionality of a peripheral device (sound) being impacted by another component (VNC), the appropriate category is:

peripherals
