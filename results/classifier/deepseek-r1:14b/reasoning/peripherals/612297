Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's see what the problem is.

The user is reporting that qemu-kvm fails to detect the mouse when installing Windows 95. They've tried different options but still can't get the mouse to be detected. They mention that USB isn't supported during setup, so they have to install a driver later with usbsupp.exe.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about mouse detection. Mice are input devices, so this falls under peripherals. It's not a translation issue or related to graphics or networking. The problem occurs during the setup process, but it's more about hardware (peripherals) than boot issues.

The bug report involves mouse detection failure in QEMU-KVM during Windows 95 installation, which relates to input device handling.
