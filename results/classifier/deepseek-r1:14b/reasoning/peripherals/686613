Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU where USB MSD aren't marked as removable. Let me go through the possible categories.

First, the categories are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report mentions that guests can access USB Mass Storage Devices but they aren't marked as removable. So it's related to how QEMU handles USB devices in the guest OS.

Looking at the categories, "peripherals" seems relevant because USB devices are peripherals. The issue is about their properties not being correctly set (removable), which affects device management in the VM.

I don't think it's mistranslation or assembly since those relate to code translation or lowering. Other categories like network, socket, or graphic don't fit here. Itâ€™s more about device handling, specifically USB peripherals.

So, the category should be "peripherals".

The bug report deals with how QEMU handles USB Mass Storage Devices (MSD), specifically that they aren't marked as removable in guest operating systems. This issue pertains to the management and configuration of hardware devices within a virtual machine environment. Since the problem is related to device properties and their interaction with the guest OS, it falls under the category of peripherals.

**Answer:** peripherals
