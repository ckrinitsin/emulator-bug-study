Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is about keyboard errors in DOS under QEMU. Specifically, cursor keys and some letter keys are repeating, especially when typing quickly. The numpad arrows work fine, but the insert key doesn't function. The user referenced similar bugs related to "drunken keyboard" in go32v2 programs and a VirtualBox ticket that mentions a QEMU patch.

Looking at the categories, this issue is about input device behaviorâ€”specifically how the keyboard is handled in the virtual machine. Since it's related to keyboard keys not working correctly, it falls under the peripherals category because it involves hardware devices (keyboard) interacting with the VM.
