Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user is reporting a bug with QEMU related to USB pass-through for a printer. So, when the guest VM starts, the printer is connected and works if it's on. But if the host turns off the printer, both the host and the VM stop showing it. Then, when the printer is turned back on, the host recognizes it again, but the VM doesn't. This only happens with QEMU 2.1.0; it worked in a previous version like 1.0.

First, I need to categorize this bug. The possible categories are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the issue, it's about USB devices not reattaching after being turned off and on. USB pass-through is a feature that allows devices connected to the host to be used by the guest VM. The problem occurs when the device is disconnected (turned off) and then reconnected (turned on). The guest doesn't recognize it again, which suggests an issue with how QEMU handles hot-plugging or device reconnection.

The user mentioned using KVM, so this relates to virtualization. USB devices are peripherals in a VM setup. So the category should be related to handling peripherals. "Peripheral" is one of the categories listed. 

I don't think it's a network issue because it's about USB specifically. It's not a graphic or socket problem either. It's also not about kernel, hypervisor, or performance issues directly; it's more about device management within the VM.

So, putting it all together, this is a peripherals-related bug because it's about the handling of a USB device in the guest VM when the device is disconnected and reconnected.
