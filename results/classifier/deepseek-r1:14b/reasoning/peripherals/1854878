Alright, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the provided categories for QEMU. The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue described is about a USB thumbdrive being treated as read-only even after specifying the 'raw' format. The user ran QEMU with '-drive file=\\.\PhysicalDrive1,format=raw' expecting it to allow writes, but still faced read-only behavior. However, when using the 'snapshot' option, writes worked correctly.

This problem relates to how QEMU handles physical drives and their write permissions. Since the drive is a physical device connected to the host, QEMU might impose restrictions even if the format is specified as raw. This could be an issue with how QEMU interacts with hardware devices, specifically USB peripherals.

Looking at the categories, 'peripherals' seems appropriate because it's related to handling input/output devices like USB drives. Other options like 'device' or 'hardware' aren't listed, so 'peripherals' is the closest fit.

The bug report deals with QEMU incorrectly treating a physical USB drive as read-only despite specifying raw format, which relates to how QEMU interacts with hardware peripherals.

**Answer:**

peripherals
