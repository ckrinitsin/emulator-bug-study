Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "Mouse stops working when connected USB-storage device." The categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the issue is about a mouse stopping when a USB storage device is connected. So it's related to hardware devices, specifically USB. The mouse is a peripheral, but more importantly, connecting a storage device affects other devices. This sounds like an interaction between different hardware components under QEMU's management.

Looking at the categories, "peripherals" could be relevant since both mouse and USB are peripherals. But the problem seems related to how the USB device is handled, possibly causing issues with other devices. Maybe it's a resource conflict or incorrect driver behavior when multiple USB devices are attached.

Another category is "device," which is broader but might fit because it's about device interaction. However, "peripherals" feels more precise here because we're dealing with specific hardware devices connected via USB.

I think the best fit is "peripherals." It directly relates to the mouse and USB storage devices being peripherals under QEMU's control.

The issue involves a peripheral (mouse) malfunctioning when another peripheral (USB-storage device) is connected, making the most appropriate category:

peripherals
