Okay, so I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user reported that the mouse cursor disappears in a RHEL guest when using specific options: "-device virtio-vga-gl -display gtk,gl=on". They also provided steps to reproduce, which include building QEMU with certain configurations and installing RHEL 8.5 before running it. The issue is that once the VM starts, moving the mouse causes the cursor to disappear.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem seems related to how the mouse input is handled in QEMU. The options used include VirtIO VGA with OpenGL and GTK display settings. Since the issue is about the mouse cursor disappearing, it's likely a problem with the display or graphics handling rather than something like network or permissions.

VirtIO devices are usually part of the device category, but since this specifically affects the mouse (a peripheral) in the graphical environment, maybe it's more related to the graphic subsystem. Alternatively, it could be an issue with how the VirtIO-VGA interacts with the display setup, which might fall under peripherals or graphics.

But wait, looking at the categories again, 'peripherals' is a separate category. The mouse is a peripheral device, so if the cursor disappears, it's probably related to how QEMU handles input devices in this context. However, since it's happening with VirtIO-VGA and GTK display options, maybe it's more about the graphics setup causing the issue.

Alternatively, could it be a problem with the hypervisor or KVM? The bug occurs when using KVM as one of the enabled features during build, but I don't think that's directly causing the mouse issue. More likely, it's an interaction between the display and input handling.

So considering all this, 'peripherals' seems like a possible category since the mouse is a peripheral device and its disappearance is related to how QEMU manages input in the VM.
