Okay, so I've got this bug report about QEMU where the NumLock isn't working properly when using DOS under QEMU. The user is reporting that they can't turn on NumLock for input numbers, which affects games that require it. They mentioned testing both Windows and Linux builds.

First, I need to classify this issue into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

The problem is related to the keyboard functionality in DOS under QEMU. NumLock not working correctly suggests an issue with how the keyboard input is being handled, possibly at the device level. Since it's about peripheral devices (the keyboard) and how QEMU emulates them, I'm leaning towards 'peripherals' as the category.

I should also consider other possibilities to make sure I'm correct. It doesn't seem related to assembly lowering or mistranslation because those would be more about code translation issues rather than input handling. Graphic and network don't fit here either since the issue is with keyboard input, not display or networking. KVM is about virtualization for full OS runs, which might not apply directly here since it's a DOS environment. Boot isn't relevant to input during runtime.

So yes, 'peripherals' seems like the right category because it deals with hardware device emulation, specifically the keyboard.

The issue relates to keyboard functionality in QEMU under DOS, particularly with NumLock handling. This is an input device problem, making 'peripherals' the appropriate category.

**Answer:** peripherals
