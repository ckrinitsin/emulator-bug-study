Alright, let's try to figure out what category this bug report falls into. The user mentioned that the PS2 keyboard isn't working after booting, but only when using libspice to connect. They also noted that when they start multiple QEMU VMs, some have this issue. However, rebooting or migrating fixes it.

Looking at the steps to reproduce, starting 40 VMs asynchronously might be causing resource contention, which could affect input handling. The gdb debug shows a hang in "prepare_mmio_access" and mentions that keyboard events are added to the queue but not read, suggesting an issue with event processing.

The PS2 keyboard is a hardware device, so this seems related to how QEMU handles peripherals. Since it's about device interaction, specifically the keyboard as a peripheral device, the category should be 'peripherals'.
