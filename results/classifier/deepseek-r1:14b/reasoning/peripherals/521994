Alright, I'm looking at this bug report where Windows 98 isn't detecting the mouse in QEMU with SeaBIOS. The user provided some debug output which shows that there are issues with the PS/2 controller.

First, the error messages mention "ps2_recvbyte timeout" multiple times, which indicates a problem with the PS/2 communication. Since the mouse typically uses the PS/2 interface, this points towards an issue with how QEMU or SeaBIOS handles the PS/2 devices.

Looking at the commit mentioned, it switched from pc-bios to seabios. So perhaps this change introduced some regression in the handling of PS/2 devices. The debug output shows that there are no serial ports found and mentions the PS/2 irq but no data, which suggests that the mouse (a PS/2 device) isn't being properly initialized or recognized.

The possible categories include "peripherals" which covers hardware devices like mice and keyboards connected to the system. Since the issue is specifically with the mouse not being detected, which is a peripheral device, this seems to fit under the peripherals category.

Other possibilities were considered, like whether it's related to network (since some devices use similar communication), but since the problem is about PS/2 and SeaBIOS, it's more aligned with how peripherals are handled in the BIOS.
