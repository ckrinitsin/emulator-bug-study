Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The issue is about an invalid PMU interrupt ID in an ARM virtual machine's device tree. The commit mentioned, 9036e917f8357f4e5965ebfecdab5964d40e6a40, changes the definition of PPI interrupt IDs but forgets to update the PMU device tree accordingly.

Looking at the provided patch, it modifies hw/arm/virt.c. The change is in how the "interrupts" property is set for the PMU node in the device tree. Previously, it used VIRTUAL_PMU_IRQ directly, but now it's using INTID_TO_PPI(VIRTUAL_PMU_IRQ). So the bug is related to incorrect handling of interrupt IDs in the device tree.

The categories I have are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Since this issue involves the device tree and PMU (which is a peripheral), it's related to how devices are defined and configured. The problem isn't about translation or assembly lowering; it's more about incorrect configuration data in the device tree affecting hardware peripherals.

Therefore, the most appropriate category here would be "peripherals" because the bug is within the handling of PMU as a peripheral device.
