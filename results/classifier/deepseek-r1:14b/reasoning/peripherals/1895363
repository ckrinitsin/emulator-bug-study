Okay, so I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem described is with Borland IDEs where cursor key presses are doubled. The user explains that these DOS-era programs read the PS2 input register multiple times per byte, expecting each byte to stay for a few hundred microseconds before the next comes in. However, QEMU immediately sends the next byte upon a guest read, which breaks this expectation.

So, looking at the categories:

- It's not a mistranslation or assembly issue because it's about how input is handled.
- Not graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, hypervisor either. Those don't seem relevant here.
- The issue is related to the PS2 port and how QEMU handles device input timing. It affects peripherals because it's about keyboard input which is a peripheral device.

Therefore, 'peripherals' seems like the most fitting category since it deals with hardware devices and their interaction with the guest OS in QEMU.
