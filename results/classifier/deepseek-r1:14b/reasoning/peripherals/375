Alright, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. The task is to categorize a given bug report into one of several predefined categories related to QEMU. 

First, I'll read the bug report carefully: "MacOS 11.4 (x86_64) Host - USB passthrough appears to be broken." So, the issue is about USB passthrough not working on macOS 11.4 when using QEMU.

Now, looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and mistranslation (under assembly). 

USB passthrough typically relates to how devices are handled in virtual machines. In QEMU, this involves emulating or passing through hardware devices so the VM can use them. Since USB is a type of peripheral device, the most fitting category seems to be 'peripherals'.

I should consider other options too. Is it related to network? No, because USB isn't network-related. Graphic issues would pertain more to display problems. Socket and kernel seem less likely here. KVM is about hypervisors but the problem is specifically with device passthrough, not the hypervisor itself.

So, 'peripherals' seems the correct category as it directly relates to hardware devices like USB being passed through in a VM.

The bug report concerns USB passthrough functionality, which falls under hardware device management. In QEMU, this typically involves how peripherals are handled and made available to virtual machines. Therefore, the appropriate category is:

**peripherals**
