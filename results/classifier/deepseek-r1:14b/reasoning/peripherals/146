Okay, I need to classify this bug report about macOS guests reading the USB 3.0 bus as USB 2.0 in QEMU. Let me think through the possible categories.

First, the issue is related to USB devices. The guest OS is misidentifying a USB 3.0 device as USB 2.0. In QEMU, this likely involves how the hypervisor handles USB devices.

Looking at the categories: peripherals include things like USB, serial ports, etc., so that seems relevant. Other options like network or graphic don't fit because it's not about networking or display issues.

So, the bug is probably under 'peripherals' since it's about USB device handling.
