Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "Support for additional CMOS memory banks." The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is about adding support for more CMOS memory banks. CMOS usually refers to the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor RAM used in computers for various purposes, including hardware configuration data. In QEMU, which emulates hardware, supporting additional CMOS memory banks likely relates to the devices being emulated or how they're configured.

Looking at the categories, "peripherals" seems appropriate because CMOS is part of the system's hardware components, and adding support would involve device emulation. Other options like "device" are too generic, but since it's about memory banks in a specific context (CMOS), peripherals fits better as it relates to the overall hardware devices being managed by QEMU.

I don't think it's about assembly or mistranslation because those relate more to code generation or translation issues. It's not performance-related either; it's about adding functionality for additional hardware resources.

So, I'll go with "peripherals."
