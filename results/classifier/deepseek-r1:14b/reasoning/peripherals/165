Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "No evdev mouse passthrough with virtio-vga or kvm". The categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about mouse passthrough not working. Mouse passthrough typically relates to how devices are handled in a virtualized environment. Since it's related to input devices (mouse), that points towards the "peripherals" category because peripherals usually include input/output devices like mice, keyboards, etc.

Looking at the possible categories, 'device' could also be relevant, but 'peripherals' is more specific to input/output hardware. The bug mentions evdev, which is related to device events in Linux, and KVM is involved as a hypervisor. However, the core issue is about mouse passthrough not functioning, which falls under how peripherals are handled in the virtual environment.

So, the most appropriate category here is 'peripherals'.
