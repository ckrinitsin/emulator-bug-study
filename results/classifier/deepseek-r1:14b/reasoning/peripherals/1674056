Alright, I'm looking at this bug report and trying to figure out which category it falls into. The user is having trouble with their QEMU/KVM setup where the host's keyboard and mouse are being "sucked in" by the VM. They can't control the host because the input devices are grabbed by QEMU regardless of whether they're using graphics or not.

The command line they provided shows that they've tried various options like -nographics, -curses, and others, but none seem to fix the issue. They mention that even without a GUI, the problem persists, which makes me think it's related to how QEMU handles input devices when running in headless mode.

I remember that QEMU has features for capturing keyboard and mouse input, especially when using certain display types or when not properly configuring the device passthrough. The user tried specifying USB devices but still experienced the same behavior. It seems like the VM is taking over the host's input, which isn't intended in a headless setup.

Looking at the categories provided: hypervisor would be related to KVM itself, but this issue is more about device handling. The problem here is with peripheral devices (keyboard and mouse) being captured by QEMU/KVM, so the appropriate category should be 'peripherals'.
