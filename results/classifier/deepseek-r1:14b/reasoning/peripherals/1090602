Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The report is about QEMU and suggests adding an option to specify a USB host device by its serial number. Currently, users can only specify devices using vendor and product IDs, which isn't enough when multiple identical devices are present.

Looking at the categories: 'usb-host' falls under peripherals since it's related to hardware devices connected to the system. The issue is about enhancing how these devices are specified, so it's not a translation error or assembly problem. It also doesn't fit into other specific areas like network, graphics, or kernel directly. 

Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'peripherals' because it deals with USB devices and their management in QEMU.
