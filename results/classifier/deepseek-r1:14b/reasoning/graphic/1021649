Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report related to QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the report carefully.

The user mentioned that when using QEMU 1.1.0, it waits for a keypress at boot. They provided some context and a test script. Notably, they mention that removing the `-nographic` option fixes the problem, and switching from `virtio-scsi` to `virtio-blk` also resolves it.

Hmm, so the issue occurs during the boot process of QEMU. The key point here is that the emulator is pausing at startup, waiting for a user input. This suggests an issue with how QEMU handles the graphical or display-related output, possibly because without `-nographic`, it uses the default which might be expecting some interaction.

The fact that changing the device (from sCSI to blk) affects this makes me think it's related to the I/O devices being emulated. Maybe the graphics or display drivers are involved in how input is handled during boot.

Looking at the categories provided, "graphic" seems like a likely fit because it's affecting the visual output and user interaction with the emulator. Alternatively, "device" could be considered since it's about the hardware devices (like virtio-scsi), but the main issue here is the keypress waiting, which points more towards graphical I/O handling.

So, putting it all together, the bug report relates to how QEMU handles graphics or display during boot, leading to a keypress wait. Therefore, the category should be "graphic".
