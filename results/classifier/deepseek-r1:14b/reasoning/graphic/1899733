Alright, let's break down this bug report. The user is experiencing issues with QEMU 5.1.0-1 when using GPU passthrough on a macOS VM. Specifically, the VM only starts if an HDMI cable is attached. Without it, the VM doesn't start and there are no logs indicating what's wrong.

First, I need to understand the components involved here. The setup includes GPU passthrough with an NVIDIA GTX Titan Black, which suggests that this is a hardware virtualization scenario, likely using KVM under libvirt on Manjaro. The user mentions two monitors: one connected via HDMI and another via DVI converted to VGA.

The problem occurs when the HDMI cable is removed. Without it, QEMU doesn't start, and the second monitor just shows a black screen with the power LED blinking. This behavior changed between QEMU 4.2 and 5.1.0-1, implying that something in the update caused this regression.

Now, considering the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The key here is GPU passthrough and monitor configuration. The issue relates to how QEMU handles graphics when certain cables are attached or not. Since the VM starts with HDMI but not without, it's likely a problem in how QEMU detects or initializes the GPU resources based on the connected monitors.

GPU passthrough typically involves assigning specific hardware resources (like the GPU) to the VM, and this is handled by the hypervisor (in this case, KVM) and the virtualization stack. If the detection of available monitors affects the VM's ability to start, it points towards a graphics-related issue in QEMU.

The user also mentioned that this works with an older version of QEMU but not the newer one, suggesting a regression introduced in 5.1.0-1. This further points towards changes in how QEMU handles GPU or display configuration during VM startup.

Looking at the possible categories, "graphic" seems to fit best because the issue revolves around monitor connections and GPU passthrough, which are graphics-related functionalities in QEMU.

The bug report describes an issue where a macOS VM using GPU passthrough fails to start when the HDMI cable is detached. The problem occurs with QEMU 5.1.0-1 but worked with version 4.2, suggesting a regression. The issue is related to how QEMU handles monitor connections during GPU initialization.
