Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user is reporting that `max_hostmem=1000` isn't working with `virtio-vga-gl`. They expect 1GB video memory but get 0MB.

First, I'll look at the problem: it's related to video memory allocation for a VGA device in QEMU. The tool they're using is virglrenderer, which is part of the Virtio-GPU support. `max_hostmem` is supposed to set the maximum host memory available for the VM, but here it seems not working with the virgl device.

Looking at the categories: 'graphic' seems relevant because it's about VGA and video memory in a graphical context. Other possible categories could be 'device' since it's a hardware-related issue, but 'graphic' is more specific. There's no mention of translation issues or assembly lowering, so 'mistranslation' doesn't fit. It's not performance, network, socket, or others listed.

Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'graphic'.

The bug report is about video memory allocation for a graphical device (virgl-vga-gl), so it falls under the 'graphic' category.
