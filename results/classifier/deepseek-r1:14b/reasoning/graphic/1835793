Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is working with QEMU and using a custom BIOS they developed based on EDK2. They successfully ran EDK2 BIOS but when using their personalized version, QEMU throws an error saying "guest has not initialized display."

First, I'll break down the information given. The command used is similar for both BIOS images: `-net none`. The main difference is that their custom BIOS has more features. The error message points to a problem with the display initialization.

I know that QEMU handles different types of hardware emulations, including graphics and displays. If the guest OS or BIOS doesn't initialize the display, it could be related to how the GPU is being emulated or configured in QEMU.

Looking at the possible categories: graphic seems relevant because the error mentions the display not initializing. Other categories like network (since `-net none` was used) might not fit here. The issue isn't about translation, assembly, performance, or permissions but rather hardware initialization.

So, considering all this, the category should be related to graphics.
