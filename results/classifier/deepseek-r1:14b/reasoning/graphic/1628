Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The issue is about Windows display scaling causing an exception in QEMU.

Looking at the problem description: When the display scale is set to 150% or higher, the system throws an exception. The user provided code snippets from `qxl-render.c` and `QXLDod.cpp`. 

In `qxl-render.c`, there's a loop that processes chunks of data. The comment mentions that when getting the next chunk, it uses the current chunk's data size instead of the next chunk's. This can cause an exception if the next chunk's allocated size is smaller than the current one.

The code example shows that `qxl_phys2virt` is called with the current chunk's data size, which might be larger than what the next chunk actually has. This leads to an out-of-bounds access or allocation issue.

In `QXLDod.cpp`, the function `PutBytesAlign` allocates memory for the next chunk but uses a different size than intended. The calculation of `alloc_size` in this function might not correctly handle cases where multiple chunks are needed, especially when scaling up display sizes.

The user suggests modifying the code to first get the next chunk's data size before proceeding. This adjustment ensures that each chunk is processed with its correct size, preventing exceptions due to mismatched allocations.

The bug relates to how QEMU handles display data chunks, particularly in the graphical rendering part. The issue occurs during the processing of graphics data when scaling up, leading to a crash or exception.

Considering the categories provided: `graphic` seems appropriate because it's related to display handling and rendering issues.
