Alright, let's figure out how to classify this bug report. The user provided a detailed description of the problem they're encountering with QEMU when using OpenGL acceleration and seccomp sandboxing.

First, the crash happens immediately upon startup when certain flags are set, specifically `spawn=deny`. This suggests that the issue is related to how QEMU interacts with system calls after applying seccomp restrictions. The audit log shows a clone syscall being blocked, which ties into the seccomp policies in place.

The problem occurs during OpenGL initialization after seccomp has taken effect. Since OpenGL acceleration involves graphics drivers and libraries like NVIDIA's user-mode ones, there's likely an interaction between these components and QEMU's sandboxing mechanisms. The suggested solution is to adjust when seccomp is activated or modify how frontends initialize before applying the sandbox.

Looking at the possible categories, we have 'graphic' as one of them. Since the issue arises from OpenGL usage and graphics-related initialization, it makes sense that this falls under the 'graphic' category.
