Okay, so I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let's read through the problem description carefully.

The user is experiencing an issue with fullscreen functionality in QEMU 6.2.0. When they set the guest display resolution to native and press ctrl+alt+f, the fullscreen only covers the QEMU window, not the entire host screen. This doesn't happen when using certain other configurations, like `-display sdl` or `-device virtio-vga`.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, etc. The problem seems related to how the display is handled. When they change the device (like from qxl-vga to virtio-vga), the issue goes away, which suggests it's tied to a specific hardware device or display driver.

The key here is that the fullscreen mode isn't working as expected with certain devices and display settings. Since it works when using `-display sdl` or `-device virtio-vga`, but not others, it points more towards an issue with how the graphical output is being managed rather than a specific hardware device alone. But given that changing the device affects the outcome, maybe it's part of the graphic handling.

Alternatively, since the problem occurs when adjusting display resolutions and using certain fullscreen options, perhaps it's related to the way QEMU interacts with the host's display settings or graphics drivers. That would fall under the 'graphic' category because it's about how the graphical interface is rendered or managed.

I'm leaning towards 'graphic' as the category because the issue revolves around the display behavior in fullscreen mode, which directly relates to how the graphical output is handled by QEMU.
