Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is having trouble with their QEMU setup on ARM/AARCH64 guests after migrating from virtio-gpu-pci to virtio-gpu-gl-pci. When they use virtio-gpu-gl-pci, the guest screen doesn't display anythingâ€”it's black. However, switching back to virtio-gpu-pci allows the image to load but without GL acceleration. They also mention that changing SDL to GTK didn't help.

Looking at the steps to reproduce, they're using a Debian netinstall ISO and specific EDK2 files. The key part here is that it works with virtio-gpu-pci but not with virtio-gpu-gl-pci on ARM guests. This suggests an issue related to the GPU device or its driver in QEMU.

The categories include things like 'graphic', 'device', etc. Since the problem revolves around the GPU device and display issues, 'graphic' seems appropriate. The failure is specifically when using a GL-enabled GPU device, so it's likely a graphics-related bug.

The issue pertains to the GPU device not functioning correctly in ARM guests after switching to virtio-gpu-gl-pci, leading to display problems. This points to a graphics-related problem.
