Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "Building hw-display-virtio-*-gl modules with empty source set." Let me break it down.

First, the issue is about building certain hardware display modules related to VirtIO-Graphics (VGA) in QEMU. The key part here is that the source set is empty. This suggests there's a problem when trying to compile these modules without any source files.

Looking at the possible categories: assembly lowering, which deals with converting code during compilation; device relates to hardware devices; graphic pertains to display and graphics handling. Since the bug involves VirtIO-Graphics, it seems related to the graphics subsystem in QEMU.

VirtIO-Graphics is part of the virtual GPU implementation, so any build issues here would fall under the 'graphic' category. The empty source set likely causes compilation errors specific to these graphic modules.
