Okay, so I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is having an issue with the VNC console in QEMU when using high resolutions like 4K. The problem includes the screen being cut off on the right side and mouse coordinates being offset. They mentioned that this happens with both TightVNC Viewer and RealVNC Viewer, so it's not viewer-specific.

They created a VM with Fedora 37, used `virtio-vga-gl` and `egl-headless`, and set the resolution to 4K or higher horizontal pixels. Even when using `-device virtio-vga-gl,edid=off,xres=3840,yres=2160`, the issue persists. However, turning off EDID helps with lower resolutions like 2560x1600.

They also noted that this occurs under both Wayland and Xorg, indicating it's a deeper issue in how QEMU handles VNC connections at high resolutions. The user suggests that the VNC protocol supports 4K fine, so it's likely an issue with QEMU's implementation of the VNC server.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, etc. Since the problem is related to display resolution and graphical output in the VNC console, "graphic" seems like the most appropriate category.

The bug report describes issues with the VNC console's graphical display when using high resolutions, specifically 4K or higher. The problems include screen cutoff and mouse offset, which are graphical rendering issues within QEMU's VNC server. Therefore, the appropriate category is:

graphic
