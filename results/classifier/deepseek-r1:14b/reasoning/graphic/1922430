Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. So the user is having an issue with QEMU where when they use "-device virtio-vga,virgl=on -display gtk,gl=on", the window doesn't display correctly at 1280x960. Instead, it's tiny and they have to uncheck "zoom to fit" to get the correct size. But with "-device qxl", it works fine.

First, I need to look at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue seems related to how QEMU handles graphics output. The user is using VirtIO-VGA with VirGL enabled and the display set to GTK with OpenGL. When they do this, the window size isn't respected correctly unless they disable "zoom to fit." In contrast, using QXL works as expected.

VirtIO-VGA and VirGL are related to GPU acceleration in QEMU, specifically for better graphics performance in virtual machines. The problem arises when setting a specific resolution via the kernel command line parameter "vga=1280x960". So it's likely an issue with how VirtIO or VirGL is handling the resolution configuration.

Looking at the categories, "graphic" seems like the most appropriate because the issue is about display resolution and window sizing in QEMU, which falls under graphics handling. The other options don't fit as wellâ€”this isn't a problem with assembly translation, permissions, networking, or hypervisor functions specifically.
