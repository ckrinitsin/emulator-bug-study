Alright, let me try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user is talking about QEMU's behavior with mouse grabbing and window management in their i3 setup. They mention that when they switch workspaces using "Win+2", the '2' key gets sent to the guest instead of just moving focus. They want QEMU to only grab the mouse after a click, not automatically.

So, looking at the possible categories: It's not about translation issues (mistranslation), nor assembly lowering (assembly). The problem is related to how QEMU handles input and window management. Specifically, the issue arises when using the display SDL because that's part of QEMU's graphical handling. 

The user is experiencing an issue with window focus and mouse grabbing, which falls under the 'graphic' category since it's about the visual interface and input handling in the display. Other categories like 'network' or 'vnc' don't fit here because the problem isn't related to networking or remote desktop but rather the local graphical environment.

So, I think the correct category is 'graphic'.

The issue relates to how QEMU handles mouse grabbing and window focus under a graphical interface, so it falls under 'graphic'.
