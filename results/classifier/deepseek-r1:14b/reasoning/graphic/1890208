Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user is reporting that the mouse pointer disappears when it's over a console window in QEMU. They mention they're using a simple hardware setup with just a text console and no mouse. They expect the mouse to behave normally, not interacting with the emulated system, but the disappearance is causing issues with managing multiple applications and virtual machines.

Looking at their setup: Virtual Machine Manager 2.2.1, QEMU 4.2.0 on Fedora 32 with KDE Plasma 5.18.5. The problem affects how they use their environment, especially with window switching.

Now, considering the categories provided:

- Mistranslation, assembly, other are possible but don't seem to fit here.
- Device: Might relate to hardware devices, but the issue is about mouse pointer visibility in the UI, not hardware interaction.
- Graphic: This seems relevant because it's a display-related issue. The mouse pointer disappearing is a graphical problem within the emulator's interface.
- Network, socket, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor don't directly apply here.

The issue pertains to how QEMU handles the mouse pointer in its graphical display, so "graphic" appears to be the most fitting category. It's about the visual behavior of the interface rather than underlying hardware or system processes.

The bug report involves an issue with the mouse pointer disappearing within the console window, which relates to the graphical display handling in QEMU. Therefore, the appropriate category is:

**graphic**
