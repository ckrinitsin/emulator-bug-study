Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is experiencing an issue with QEMU where the LightDM resolution isn't correct in their Ubuntu guest OS. They provided details about their setup, including the host and guest configurations, and mentioned a workaround they found.

First, I'll look at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem is related to display resolution in QEMU. The user mentioned using 'vga vmware' in their startup options. Since the issue is with the graphical display and resolution settings not being applied correctly, it likely falls under a graphics-related category.

Looking at the categories, 'graphic' seems the most fitting because it's directly about the visual output of the virtual machine. The other options like network or kernel don't seem to fit here since the problem isn't with connectivity or system performance but rather with how the graphical environment is being handled.

I should also consider if this could be a KVM issue, as KVM is involved in hardware acceleration. However, the specific symptom points more towards a display configuration problem within QEMU's setup, which would be under 'graphic'.
