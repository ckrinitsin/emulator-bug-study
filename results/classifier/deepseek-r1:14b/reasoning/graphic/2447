Alright, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the provided categories. Let's see what the issue is about.

The user reports that when using QEMU with SDL display and OpenGL enabled (using flags `-display sdl,gl=on`), the mouse cursor position is incorrect. Specifically, the real mouse is nearly 100px to the left of where it appears on the VM window. This discrepancy worsens as the cursor approaches the lower right corner.

Looking at the steps to reproduce, they're using QEMU version 9.0 with Virtio VGA and OpenGL acceleration. The issue doesn't occur when OpenGL isn't enabled, suggesting a problem related to how the mouse position is handled in the graphics pipeline.

The possible categories include 'graphic' which seems relevant here because it's about display issues. Other options like 'device' or 'network' don't fit as well since the problem is specific to visual positioning. The issue isn't about permissions, performance, or kernel functions either.

Therefore, the most appropriate category for this bug report is 'graphic'.

The issue revolves around incorrect mouse cursor positioning when using OpenGL acceleration in QEMU's SDL display mode. This points to a graphics-related problem, likely in how the cursor position is calculated or rendered with 3D acceleration enabled.
