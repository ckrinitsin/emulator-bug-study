Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "Intel GVT-g works in X11, segfaults in wayland". Let me break it down.

First, understanding what GVT-g is. It's a graphics virtualization technology for Intel GPUs. So, it's related to the graphical output of QEMU.

The user mentions that it works with X11 but causes a segfault (segmentation fault) when using Wayland. Both X11 and Wayland are display servers, so the issue is likely in how the graphics drivers or QEMU interacts with these environments.

Looking at the possible categories: graphic seems relevant because it's about graphical output issues. Other options like device or kernel might be related, but since it's specifically about graphics under two different window systems, 'graphic' fits best.
