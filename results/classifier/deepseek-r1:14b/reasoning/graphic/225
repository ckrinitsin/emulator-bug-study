Alright, so I need to classify this bug report: "Menu is not clickable on OSX Catalina". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

First, the issue is about a menu not being clickable in QEMU on macOS Catalina. Since QEMU is an emulator and virtualization tool, I'm thinking about which parts of it could be causing this.

"Menu" likely refers to the graphical user interface (GUI) elements, so maybe something wrong with how QEMU handles graphics or display output. Could it be related to VNC? Because sometimes when remote desktop services are involved, there might be issues with input devices like the mouse not working as expected.

Alternatively, if the menu is part of the host's graphical interface, perhaps the problem lies in the way QEMU interacts with the host's graphics drivers or system calls. This could tie into device handling, especially input devices, which might fall under peripherals or graphic categories.

Looking at the options, 'graphic' seems like a potential fit because it directly relates to display and UI elements. The menu being unclickable suggests an issue with how QEMU is rendering or handling user interface events in the graphical environment on macOS Catalina.

The bug report mentions that the menu is not clickable on OSX Catalina. Since this involves the graphical user interface (GUI) of QEMU, it likely relates to issues with how QEMU handles display output or interacts with the host's graphics system. This falls under the 'graphic' category as it pertains to visual elements and user interaction within the emulator.

**Answer: graphic**
