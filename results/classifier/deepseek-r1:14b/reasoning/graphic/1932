Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is having an issue with QEMU where the grab on hover setting isn't working as expected. They mention that setting `vmport=off` in `-M` or emulating a USB mouse and disabling `psmouse` in the guest can fix it, but the setting itself seems broken.

First, I need to understand what "grab on hover" refers to. It sounds like a feature related to how the mouse is handled when moving over the VM window. In QEMU, this is typically managed by the display backend, which could be something like GTK or SPICE.

The user mentions that the setting can be toggled in the menu but isn't functioning correctly. They also point out that `vmport` seems to control whether the grab happens, and they want the setting to influence this behavior.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. Since this is about mouse handling and display settings, it likely falls under 'graphic'. The issue isn't related to kernel mode or hypervisor functions but rather the graphical interface's behavior.

So, I think the correct category for this bug report is 'graphic'.
