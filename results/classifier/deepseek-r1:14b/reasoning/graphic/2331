Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user is asking about a CLI option for the GUI feature called "Grab On Hover." Let me think about what each category means.

Looking at the options: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report is asking if there's a CLI option for "Grab On Hover," which sounds like it's related to the graphical user interface (GUI) of QEMU. So, the feature in question is part of the GUI. Now, checking the categories, I see 'graphic' as an option, which would cover GUI-related issues.

I don't think this falls into other categories like network or KVM because those are more about system-level components rather than the user interface. Therefore, the most appropriate category here should be 'graphic.'
