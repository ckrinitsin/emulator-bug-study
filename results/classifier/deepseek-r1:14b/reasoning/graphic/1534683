Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. Let's see what the issue is about.

The user mentioned they're using QEMU version 2.4.1 with the qxl graphic card and an SDL2 client as the display. The problem occurs when running a Windows Seven guest, where there's no mouse cursor visible. However, it works fine with Windows 8.1. They need this for using two monitors with their Windows guest.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about the mouse cursor not showing up in a QEMU VM when using qxl graphics. Since it's related to the display and specifically the mouse cursor which is part of the graphical output, this points towards a problem with the graphic subsystem.

I recall that qxl is related to QEMU's accelerated graphics support, so any issues here would fall under the 'graphic' category rather than something else like network or device. There's no mention of networking, sockets, or KVM hypervisor specifics beyond what's necessary for running the VM.

Therefore, the appropriate classification for this bug report is 'graphic'.

The issue revolves around the absence of a mouse cursor in a QEMU virtual machine using qxl graphics under Windows Seven, which works correctly under Windows 8.1. Since this pertains to graphical display functionality within the guest OS, it falls under the 'graphic' category.
