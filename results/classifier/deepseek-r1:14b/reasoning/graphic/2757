Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "EGL can't handle multi plane textures." Let's break it down.

First, EGL stands for Embedded Graphics Library. It's used for handling graphics and OpenGL ES in embedded systems and within QEMU's graphical output processing.

The issue is that EGL isn't handling multi-plane textures correctly. Multi-plane textures are commonly used in video decoding to support high-quality scaling and rendering, especially with formats like VP9 or AV1 where multiple planes (like Y, U, V) are involved.

Now, looking at the possible categories: graphic seems appropriate since it's related to how graphics are processed. Other options like device or peripherals might be broader but not as precise. Performance isn't directly mentioned, nor is it a boot issue or network-related.

So, the category should be 'graphic' because it pertains to the handling of graphical elements within QEMU.

The bug report relates to issues with handling multi-plane textures in the graphics library (EGL), which falls under the 'graphic' category as it directly affects how graphical elements are processed.
