Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is running QEMU with different display backends and encountering a black screen when using GTK instead of SDL. 

First, they mention using `-display sdl` which works fine but switches to `gtk`, the screen goes black. Both setups are using VirtIO for VGA and OpenGL acceleration with virgl. So, it's related to how QEMU handles graphics output.

The system specs include Gentoo Linux with a custom-built QEMU that includes flags like gtk and opengl. The GPU is an NVIDIA 1070 Ti, which suggests they have proper hardware support for OpenGL.

The issue seems specific to the display backend. When using GTK, it fails, but SDL works. So it's likely related to how QEMU interacts with the display drivers or libraries when using GTK versus SDL. Since VirtIO and OpenGL are involved, it points towards a graphics-related problem in QEMU's rendering or acceleration setup.

Looking at the possible categories: graphic seems appropriate because it's about display output issues. Other possibilities like 'device' or 'network' don't fit here since it's about visual output. The failure is consistent across different setups (libvirt too), so it's a reproducible issue with QEMU's graphics handling.
