Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report about QEMU. The user mentioned that 1366x768 resolution is missing even when using -vga std or -vga vmware. They think it needs patching and suggest adding a command-line option for custom resolutions.

Looking at the possible categories, I need to figure out which one fits best. Let's go through them:

- Mistranslation: Not related here; it's about resolution.
- Assembly lowering: Doesn't seem relevant.
- Other: Possible if none of the others fit.
- Device: Maybe, but not sure yet.
- Graphic: This seems likely since it's about display resolutions.
- Socket/network/boot/vnc/debug/files/permissions/performance/kernel/peripherals/hypervisor: These don't directly relate to graphics or resolution.

The issue is about missing video resolution support, which falls under the graphic category. Adding a command-line option for custom resolutions also relates to how QEMU handles graphics output.
