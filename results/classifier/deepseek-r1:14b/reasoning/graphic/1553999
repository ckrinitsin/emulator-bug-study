Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the provided categories. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The user is trying to enable OpenGL support in QEMU using the command line options: `-display sdl,gl=on` and `-vga qxl`. However, they're encountering an error that SDL1 doesn't have OpenGL support and suggest recompiling with SDL2. The output mentions that OpenGL support is disabled.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue revolves around QEMU's display capabilities, specifically OpenGL. Since this is related to how graphics are handled in the emulator, the most fitting category seems to be "graphic". The user is dealing with a missing feature in the graphical output of QEMU, which points directly to a graphics-related problem.
