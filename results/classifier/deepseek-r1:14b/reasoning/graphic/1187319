Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user mentioned that Ctrl-Alt-- and Ctrl-Alt-+ aren't working in the SDL interface. They also tried other key combinations without success. 

First, looking at the categories provided: assembly, device, graphic, network, etc. Since the issue is about keyboard shortcuts not functioning in the graphical interface, it's related to how QEMU handles input events.

The bug isn't a translation issue because it's about user input behavior in the UI, not source-to-IR mapping. It also doesn't fall under assembly or performance issues. Considering the GUI aspect, 'graphic' seems like the most fitting category. The problem is likely with how SDL (a graphics library) processes these key presses, so it's a graphics-related bug.

The issue pertains to the graphical interface where specific keyboard shortcuts are not functioning as expected. Therefore, the correct classification is:

**graphic**
