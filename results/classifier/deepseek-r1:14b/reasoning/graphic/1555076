Okay, I need to classify this bug report in QEMU into one of the given categories. The user provided a detailed bug report where they're unable to start QEMU with certain display configurations.

Looking at their command lines, they're using either sdl or gtk as the display driver with gl=on. They also mentioned that Virtio and Virgl are configured correctly, but there's an error in surface_gl_create_texture.

The error message is from console-gl.c, line 95, indicating a problem during texture creation. This seems related to OpenGL integration within QEMU's UI layer. Since the issue occurs with both sdl and gtk display options and affects the graphical output, it points towards a graphics-related bug.

Given the categories, 'graphic' would be the most appropriate because the error is in the GL context handling for the display.

The issue relates to OpenGL texture creation during display setup, which falls under the graphics category.

**Answer:** graphic
