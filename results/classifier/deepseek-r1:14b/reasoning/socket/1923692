Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the provided categories. Let me read the report carefully.

The user is reporting an issue with QEMU 5.2.0 where the netdev socket doesn't support the "reconnect" option. They mention that other qemu socket accepting options like chardev do accept this "reconnect" parameter, but netdev socket throws an error saying it's an invalid parameter.

I need to determine which category this falls under from the list: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is specifically about the netdev socket not recognizing the "reconnect" option. Since it's related to sockets and their configuration options, the category should be 'socket'. The user also references a previous bug report which was closed without resolution, indicating this is an ongoing concern with how options are handled for socket links in QEMU.

So the category that best fits this bug report is 'socket'.
