Okay, I need to classify this bug report into the appropriate category. The user provided two stack traces from what seems like a crash related to memory management issues.

Looking at the first trace, the error is about realloc() and an invalid next size. That usually points to heap corruption or incorrect usage of dynamic memory, possibly due to overflows or using already freed pointers.

The second trace mentions "invalid next size" again in malloc_printerr. This also indicates a problem with how memory is being handled, perhaps similar issues like writing beyond allocated boundaries or double-freeing.

Both stack traces show calls to functions like __GI_abort and issues with g_realloc, which suggests that the problem occurs during memory reallocation. The presence of slirp_input in both traces points towards network-related code, possibly in a library like GLib used by QEMU or similar tools.

The fact that this happens when there's high network traffic implies that under certain conditions, the program can't handle the load correctly, leading to heap issues. This could be due to improper memory management in handling packets or data structures related to networking.

Given all this, the bug is likely a memory corruption issue in the Slirp component, which handles TCP/IP for QEMU's user-mode networking.

The bug report indicates that there are heap-related issues when handling network traffic. The problems occur during calls to `g_realloc()` and involve invalid sizes or pointers, suggesting a potential buffer overflow or improper memory management in network data processing. 

**Classification:** *Memory Corruption*
