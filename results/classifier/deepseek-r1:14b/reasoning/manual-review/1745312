Okay, let me try to understand what's going on here. The user is talking about running QEMU in a loop for testing different commits of QEMU. They have two scripts: run-qemu-loop and another script they're modifying, perhaps run-qemu or something similar.

In the code snippet provided, it looks like a loop that runs QEMU multiple times with some specific parameters. The main part is inside an if-else block where it's checking for certain strings in the output buffer. If it finds 'Reboot and select', it proceeds to do some actions; else, if it finds other specific strings, it does something else.

The user mentioned that they had to modify the top of run-qemu-loop to include disk parameters like cylinders, heads, and sectors. They were having issues where QEMU wouldn't boot correctly unless these values matched what VirtualBox determined.

So, their main points are:

1. They discovered two separate issues with QEMU: one related to how the image is created and another about CHS (Cylinders, Heads, Sectors) detection not working when using /dev/loopN.

2. They provided instructions on how to build specific branches of QEMU, which are in different directories (qemu-working and qemu-broken). These branches correspond to different commits, 306ec6c and e689f7c.

I think the user is encountering a problem where the QEMU image doesn't boot correctly unless it's created with specific CHS parameters. They had to manually set these in run-qemu-loop by adding disk options like 'disk=/path/to/wnt4ts-broken.img,format=raw,cyls=1523,heads=16,secs=63'. Without this, the boot fails.

They also tried running the image with /dev/loopN, but that didn't work either. So they concluded there are two issues: one in how QEMU creates images and another in CHS detection when using loop devices.

In their testing, they ran over 350 successful runs where commit 306ec6c only produced a boot menu, implying it's not fully functional without the correct setup. The other commit (e689f7c) might be the broken one.

The user provided steps to build these specific QEMU versions using git archive and compiling with certain configure options. They disabled several features to speed up compilation and used -j64 for faster builds, which worked on their system.

So, the main issues they're reporting are:

- The need to set CHS parameters when running QEMU images created by older QEMU versions (like 2.9.0) with certain commits.
- Problems when using /dev/loopN for disk images, leading to incorrect CHS detection and failed boots.

Their solution involves modifying the run script to include these specific disk parameters and building separate QEMU instances from specific commits to test these behaviors.

I think they're concluding that there are two bugs in QEMU: one in image creation and another in CHS handling with loop devices. They want others to reproduce their findings by following the build steps and using the provided scripts.

Based on your detailed description, here's a concise summary of the issues and solution:

### Issues Identified:
1. **CHS Geometry Configuration**: When running QEMU images created with specific commits (e.g., 306ec6c), the boot process fails unless the CHS (Cylinders, Heads, Sectors) parameters are explicitly set to match those discovered by VirtualBox. Using /dev/loopN for disk images does not correctly detect these parameters.

2. **Image Creation and Booting**: QEMU may fail to boot when using certain image creation methods or configurations, particularly with older versions like 2.9.0. The image must be created and run with specific CHS settings for reliable booting.

### Solution:
- Modify the run script (e.g., `run-qemu-loop`) to include disk parameters such as cylinders, heads, and sectors when running QEMU images.
- Build separate QEMU instances from specific commits (306ec6c and e689f7c) in different directories. Use the provided build commands to compile these versions with optimized configure options.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. **Clone QEMU Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qemu/qemu.git
   ```

2. **Build Specific Commits**:
   - For `qemu-working` (commit 306ec6c):
     ```bash
     git archive 306ec6c3cece7004429c79c1ac93d49919f1f1cc | tar xC /path/to/qemu-working/
     ```
   - For `qemu-broken` (commit e689f7c):
     ```bash
     git archive e689f7c5e4a099e7b2d8d030c0c0d11d7 | tar xC /path/to/qemu-broken/
     ```

3. **Compile with Configure Options**:
   In each directory, run the following to configure and compile QEMU (adjust options as needed):
   ```bash
   ./configure --enable-debug [other options] && make -j$(nproc)
   ```

4. **Run QEMU with CHS Parameters**:
   Include specific disk parameters when running the image in your loop script:
   ```bash
   -drive file=/path/to/wnt4ts-broken.img,format=raw,cyls=1523,heads=16,secs=63
   ```

### Conclusion:
By explicitly setting CHS parameters and building specific QEMU versions, you can reliably test booting older images. This setup highlights potential issues in image handling and device configuration within QEMU, which may require further investigation or patching.
