Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to make QEMU handle signals better. From what I understand, there's a problem where sending a SIGTERM to QEMU doesn't allow the guest OS to shut down gracefully. Instead, it just kills the guest abruptly. This is an issue because daemons should ideally handle SIGTERM by initiating a clean shutdown.

The user has proposed three solutions:

1. Classify QEMU as a daemon so it reacts properly to SIGTERM.
2. Map internal monitor actions to different signals like SIGTERM, SIGHUP, etc., using options in the command line.
3. Use scripts to handle signals, where QEMU spawns a script upon receiving a signal.

Let me break this down step by step.

Starting with solution 1: Classifying QEMU as a daemon. Daemons typically manage their own signal handling to ensure they shut down gracefully on SIGTERM. But the user mentioned that implementing this might be politically unfeasible because QEMU's current behavior is entrenched, and changing it could break existing setups.

Moving to solution 2: Mapping internal commands via signals using options like -signal SIGTERM,monitorcommand=system_powerdown. This seems more manageable as it allows both old and new users to coexist. Existing users can keep their current setup where SIGTERM triggers a forceful shutdown, while others can remap signals to actions that QEMU understands, ensuring a clean exit.

Solution 3 is about using scripts for signal handling. It's more flexible but also more complex. The idea is that when QEMU receives a signal, it spawns a script which communicates with the monitor and sends commands like system_powerdown. However, this introduces potential issues if the script fails, leaving QEMU in an uncertain state.

The user concludes that solutions 2 and 3 should include a timeout to ensure QEMU doesn't hang indefinitely. They also emphasize that without proper signal handling, QEMU behaves incorrectly as a daemon, causing data integrity issues similar to what's seen with databases.

I think the key points here are:
- SIGTERM is meant for graceful shutdowns.
- Current QEMU behavior on SIGTERM isn't ideal and causes abrupt termination.
- Solutions need to maintain backward compatibility while offering new flexibility.

The proposed solution 2 seems most viable because it uses existing QEMU infrastructure (options parsing) and allows remapping without breaking current setups. It's a middle ground that addresses both old and new requirements.

I'm wondering if there are other considerations, like how supervisors handle signals or if adding too many signal mappings could complicate things. Also, I should check if the QEMU community has discussed these solutions before, as the user mentioned some existing patches and discussions.

In summary, implementing a way to map signals to internal commands (solution 2) seems like the best approach to improve QEMU's signal handling while keeping it compatible with existing setups.

To address the issue of improper signal handling in QEMU, the proposed solution focuses on mapping internal monitor actions to specific signals. This approach ensures backward compatibility and provides flexibility for administrators.

**Solution Overview:**

1. **Signal Mapping via Command-Line Options:**
   - Introduce a command-line option allowing users to map signals (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGHUP) to internal QEMU commands.
   - Example: `-signal SIGTERM,monitorcommand=system_powerdown`

2. **Graceful Shutdown on SIGTERM:**
   - By default, SIGTERM will trigger a graceful shutdown using the monitor command `system_powerdown`.
   - This aligns with standard daemon behavior, ensuring data integrity.

3. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - Existing users can continue using their current setup where SIGTERM forces an abrupt shutdown.
   - New users can benefit from graceful termination by leveraging signal mapping.

4. **Timeout Mechanism:**
   - Implement a timeout for signal handling to prevent QEMU from hanging indefinitely, ensuring reliability.

This solution effectively balances the needs of existing and new users while enhancing QEMU's behavior as a daemon. It leverages existing infrastructure and provides a clear path forward for improving signal management.
