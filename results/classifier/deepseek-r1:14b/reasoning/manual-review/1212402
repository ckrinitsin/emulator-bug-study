Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user is experiencing an issue where enabling KVM with a recent QEMU build causes it to hang at boot on Ubuntu Precise AMD64. They've provided details about bisecting and identified a specific commit as the first bad one.

Looking at the possible categories, I see 'KVM' is listed. The problem occurs when using the -enable-kvm option, which directly relates to KVM functionality in QEMU. The bug report mentions that after applying this commit, KVM no longer works properly, leading to a hang during boot. The commit itself modifies kvm-all.c and introduces support for KVM_MEM_READONLY flags, which suggests it's related to how QEMU interacts with the kernel's KVM hypervisor.

Since the issue is specifically tied to KVM functionality after applying this change, the most appropriate category from the list is 'KVM'. Other categories like 'device', 'network', or 'hypervisor' might be considered, but 'KVM' is the most direct and relevant here.
