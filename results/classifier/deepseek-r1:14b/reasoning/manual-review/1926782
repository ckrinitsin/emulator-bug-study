Okay, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user mentioned that when building QEMU after version 5.2, the configure script fails because it can't find 'sasl/sasl.h'. They were using `--extra-cflags` and `--extra-ldflags` with proper paths, which worked until version 5.1.

Looking at the problem, they found that in the configure script, meson is being passed CFLAGS instead of QEMU_CFLAGS. The latter includes the extra flags. So, the issue is about how the build configuration is handled, specifically regarding the environment variables used for passing compiler and linker arguments during cross-building.

The bug is related to the build process and how flags are being managed in the configure script. It doesn't involve any specific component like networking, graphics, or hypervisor features but rather the build configuration itself. Since it's about the build setup and flags not being passed correctly, this falls under "build" category.

The bug report is related to the build process where certain environment variables are incorrectly used when passing compiler and linker arguments during a cross-build. This issue doesn't fall into any of the specific categories like network, graphic, or hypervisor but rather pertains to how the configure script handles these flags.
