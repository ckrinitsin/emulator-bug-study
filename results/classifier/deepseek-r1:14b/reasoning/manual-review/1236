Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is having trouble with QEMU when using the vhdx driver for blockdev. They mentioned that when they try to start the qemu-storage-daemon with a fixed-vhdx file, it doesn't work and throws an error saying "Invalid argument". 

Looking at the steps to reproduce, it seems like the issue occurs specifically with VHDX files. The user also referenced some previous issues (#727 and #806) related to VHDX corruption and expansion problems in QEMU's nbd driver. So, this might be a similar bug affecting blockdev.

The error message suggests that the storage daemon can't open the VHDX file properly, which indicates a problem with how the driver is handling the file. The user also tried adding 'subformat=fixed' but got an unexpected parameter error, showing that maybe there's an issue with how arguments are being parsed or supported by the blockdev driver.

Since the problems mentioned relate to the VHDX format and the blockdev layer, it's pointing towards issues in the storage drivers rather than other components like graphics or network. The user successfully used rawimg and qcow2-fixed, so it's likely specific to vhdx handling in blockdev.

Therefore, the category should be related to block device drivers. Looking at the options, "blockdev" is one of them, which fits this scenario perfectly.
