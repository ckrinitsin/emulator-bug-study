Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The user is reporting an issue with QEMU 10 where using Incus (a container and VM manager) causes a failure when handling NVME devices. The error message says that the 'nvme-subsys' device doesn't support hotplugging, which breaks their setup because they rely on being able to add drives dynamically.

From what I understand, in QEMU 10, there's a commit (cd59f50) that changes how NVME devices are handled. Before, each drive could have its own controller, but now when adding an 'nvme' device without an existing subsystem, it creates an 'nvme-subsys'. This subsystem doesn't support hotplugging, leading to the error.

The user's setup involves using QMP to add devices at runtime, which is essential for their workflow. The problem arises because the new behavior in QEMU 10 makes the creation of a subsystem mandatory, and this can't be hotplugged.

Looking at the categories provided: block device issues might involve storage problems but seems broader. Block device hotplug specifically refers to adding or removing devices while the system is running, which aligns with their issue since they're trying to add drives dynamically. This fits because the inability to hotplug the subsystem is causing the failure.

I don't think it's a device discovery issue because that's more about recognition rather than dynamic addition. Similarly, other categories like storage configuration or multipath might be related but not as specific as block device hotplug.

So, the key here is that the user can't add NVME devices dynamically anymore due to the subsystem requirement, which makes 'block device hotplug' the most appropriate category.

The issue described involves the inability to hotplug NVME devices in QEMU 10 due to the creation of an 'nvme-subsys' that doesn't support dynamic addition. This directly relates to block device hotplug as it pertains to adding devices while the system is running.

**Answer:**

The appropriate classification for this bug report is:

**Block Device Hotplug**
