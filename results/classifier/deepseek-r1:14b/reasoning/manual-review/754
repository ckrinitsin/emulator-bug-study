Alright, I'm trying to figure out why the instructions at 0x80046160 and 0x80046164 aren't being executed and why there's an extra instruction at 0x80046162. Let me start by understanding the context.

Looking at the provided code, it seems like a disassembly of some M68K machine code. The user mentioned that certain instructions aren't executed as expected, and an unexpected one is being added. 

First, I see that at address 0x8004615e, there's a PC value pointing to the next instruction. Then, the next instruction listed is 0x80046162: orib #20,%d0. That means the code jumped from 0x5e to 0x62, skipping the instructions at 0x60 and 0x64.

This suggests that there might be a conditional branch instruction causing this jump. Looking further, I notice that before the orib instruction, there's a brcond_i32 tmp0,$0x0,lt,$L0 in the disassembly. The 'brcond' instruction is used for conditional branching in M68K code. If the condition isn't met, it might be skipping over some instructions.

In the first set of instructions after 0x8004615e, the code checks if tmp0 is less than $0x0 (which would never be true since tmp0 was set to 0xfffffffffffffff8 earlier). So, the condition is not met, and it branches to label $L0. This skipping over of instructions explains why 0x80046160 and 0x80046164 aren't executed.

As for the extra orib instruction at 0x80046162, perhaps this is part of the code that's being jumped into after the branch. It might be an instruction within a block that wasn't supposed to execute under normal circumstances but was triggered due to some condition.

I should also consider whether there's any error in how the code is being executed or if it's related to the emulator settings, like QEMU options provided. The user ran the chroot with specific flags, so maybe something there affects instruction flow.

Another angle: perhaps there's an interrupt or exception that alters the program counter (PC) unexpectedly, causing it to jump to 0x80046162. But looking at the context, the PC changes from 0x5e to 0x62 without such events being mentioned in the logs.

I should verify if the branch instruction indeed skips those addresses and whether there's another path that leads to 0x62. Maybe an unconditional jump elsewhere or a trap.

In summary, the likely cause is the brcond_i32 instruction causing a skip of the next few instructions, leading to the execution of the orib at 0x80046162 instead. The skipped instructions (linkw and movel) are part of the code path that's taken when tmp0 is less than $0x0, which doesn't happen here.

The issue arises due to a conditional branch instruction (`brcond_i32`) in the M68K code causing the program counter (PC) to skip certain instructions. When the condition isn't met, the code jumps over `linkw %fp,#0` and `movel %a4@,%sp@-`, leading to the execution of an unexpected `orib` instruction instead.

**Answer:**

The skipped instructions at 0x80046160 and 0x80046164 are not executed because a conditional branch skips over them. The extra instruction at 0x80046162 is executed due to the flow change caused by this branching logic.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Branch Instruction:**
   - The `brcond_i32 tmp0,$0x0,lt,$L0` instruction checks if `tmp0 < $0`.
   - Since `tmp0` is 0xfffffffffffffff8 (which is not less than zero in signed terms), the condition isn't met.

2. **Determine Flow Change:**
   - Upon evaluating the false condition, the program counter jumps to `$L0`, skipping the subsequent instructions at 0x60 and 0x64.

3. **Execution of Unexpected Instruction:**
   - After the branch, the next instruction executed is `orib #20,%d0` at address 0x80046162.

**Conclusion:**

The PC skips over `linkw %fp,#0` and `movel %a4@,%sp@-` because of the conditional branch evaluating to false, leading to the execution of an unintended instruction.
