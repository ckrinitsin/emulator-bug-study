Okay, so I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. Let's read through the details carefully.

The problem is that the mouse isn't working correctly when using the SDL display backend. The user mentioned that the mouse moves erraticallyâ€”like up and down or left and right. They also noted that when they use GTK, it crashes before starting the VM. 

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about the mouse not working properly with a specific display backend (SDL). Since it's related to input devices and their interaction with the display or graphics system, I think "peripherals" would be the most appropriate category. Peripherals typically include input devices like mice, keyboards, etc., so this seems right.
