Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why my block copy job is hanging on the last block for several minutes. Let me try to understand what's happening based on the logs provided.

First, looking at the log entries, it seems like there are multiple messages indicating that the len and offset of the device in question (copy-vdb-libvirt-5-format) are both 1073741824. That number looks familiar—it’s 1GB because 1073741824 bytes equal 1 gigabyte. So, the job is trying to copy a 1GB block.

The initial log shows that the status of the device is "running", and then later it changes to "ready". The speed is zero during this time, which makes me think that no data transfer is happening when it's in the "ready" state. This suggests that maybe there's some processing happening behind the scenes once the copy is complete.

After a few minutes, the job transitions through several states: from 'waiting' to 'pending', then to 'concluded', and finally becomes 'null'. It also mentions pivoting the copy job, which I'm not entirely sure about. I think pivoting might be part of the process where the copied data is made available as a new image or something like that.

I remember that when dealing with block-level operations in virtualization environments like libvirt and KVM/QEMU, sometimes there are additional steps after the actual copying is done. This could include things like flushing caches, updating metadata, or preparing for snapshots if that's part of the process.

The fact that len equals offset doesn't trigger the job to finish immediately might be due to how QEMU or libvirt handles asynchronous operations. Maybe the monitoring system is waiting for some acknowledgment or completion signal before it can mark the job as done.

I also wonder if there's any specific configuration related to block jobs in libvirt that would cause this delay. Perhaps certain settings control whether the job should auto-finalize or if additional steps are required after the copy completes.

Looking up, I find that QEMU's block jobs, such as 'copy', can sometimes take a bit longer to finish because they might involve operations like reflinking (if supported by the storage) or metadata updates. The 'auto-finalize' being true suggests that the job is set to handle its own completion once it's done, but maybe there are some delays in the underlying storage handling.

Another thought: since the speed is zero during this time, perhaps it's not an active copy anymore but rather a verification or post-processing step. Maybe the system is ensuring data integrity after the copy, which could take additional time, especially on slower storage mediums.

I should also consider if there are any logs indicating issues with the storage backend. If libvirt is talking to a remote storage (like NFS or iSCSI), network latency or server load could contribute to delays in completing these operations. But given that it's only the last block hanging, maybe it's more about how QEMU handles job completion rather than network issues.

In summary, while len equals offset might suggest that the copy is logically done, there are likely additional steps involved in concluding the job, such as metadata updates, cache flushes, or storage-specific operations. This could explain why the job doesn't close immediately when len and offset match. It's probably normal for these block jobs to take a bit longer once the actual data transfer is complete due to these post-copy processes.

The behavior you're observing is indeed part of the normal process when dealing with block copy jobs in QEMU/KVM environments managed by libvirt. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and why the job might appear to hang:

1. **Job Completion Check**: When the `offset` equals the `len`, it indicates that all data has been successfully copied. However, this doesn't immediately conclude the job because there are post-copy operations needed.

2. **Post-Copy Operations**: After the copy completes, QEMU and libvirt perform additional tasks such as metadata updates, cache flushes, or storage-specific operations (like reflinking for thin provisioning). These steps ensure data integrity and prepare the new image for use.

3. **Job State Transitions**: The job transitions through several states after completion—'waiting', 'pending', 'concluded', and finally becoming 'null'. These state changes reflect the internal processing happening in QEMU and libvirt to finalize the operation.

4. **Auto-Finalization**: With `auto-finalize` set to true, the job is designed to handle its own conclusion once all necessary post-copy tasks are done. This might include pivoting to a new image or updating snapshots.

5. **Speed Indication**: A speed of zero during these states doesn't indicate an issue but rather that no active data transfer is occurring; instead, the system is handling metadata and other overhead operations.

**Conclusion**: It's normal for block copy jobs to take additional time after the last byte is copied due to necessary post-processing steps. The delay you're experiencing is part of the standard procedure to ensure all aspects of the virtual machine's storage are correctly updated and optimized.
