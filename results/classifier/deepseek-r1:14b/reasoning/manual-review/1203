Alright, I'm trying to figure out why the VM migration isn't finishing because of a large block dirty bitmap. Let me go through this step by step.

First, from the query-migrate info, it shows that the status is always "active." That suggests that the migration process hasn't transitioned to "completed" or "failed," so something might be stuck in the active state.

Looking at the migrate parameters, I notice that "block-incremental" is set to false. Maybe this affects how dirty bits are handled because without incremental mode, it's doing a full sync repeatedly instead of just sending deltas. That could explain why it keeps transferring the same data over and over.

The dirty-sync-count is 7,909,410. That's a huge number of dirty page syncs. Each time the bitmap is processed, maybe there are too many pages marked as dirty, causing it to take too long or loop endlessly.

Also, "postcopy-requests" and "remaining" are both zero, which might mean that after the initial transfer, there's nothing left to do, but the process isn't moving past the active state. It could be stuck waiting for some condition or in a loop.

I should check if the block size is optimal. The cluster_size is 65536 bytes (64KB), which seems fine, but maybe it's not aligning with how the dirty bits are being processed. If the bitmap granularity doesn't match the block size, that could cause inefficiencies.

Another thing is the compress-level and threads. They're set to 1 thread and level 1, which might not be enough for handling large data efficiently. Maybe increasing compression could help reduce the amount of data sent, but I'm not sure if it's related to the dirty bitmap issue.

The capabilities show that "dirty-bitmaps" is enabled, which is good because we're using them. But maybe there's a bug in how QEMU handles large bitmaps when this capability is on.

I also wonder about network performance. If the connection between the source and destination isn't stable or fast enough, it might cause the migration to stall. Checking the network stats could be important here.

Perhaps there's an issue with how the dirty pages are being tracked. With so many dirty pages, maybe the process is getting bogged down trying to handle each one individually rather than in bulk.

Looking at the parameters again, "max-bandwidth" is set quite high (134217728 bytes/s), but the actual mbps is only around 3.5, which is much lower. This discrepancy might indicate a bottleneck elsewhere, like CPU or network.

Also, "downtime-limit" is set to 300 seconds, which should be sufficient unless the VM requires less downtime.

Maybe I need to adjust some parameters. Enabling "block-incremental" could help send only deltas after the initial transfer. Also, tweaking the compress-level and threads might improve data handling speed.

It's also possible that with such a large dirty bitmap, the migration process isn't correctly transitioning states because it expects all pages to be clean or handled properly.

I should look into whether there are known issues with large bitmaps in QEMU migrations. Maybe there's a patch or a workaround available for this specific scenario.

Testing with smaller bitmaps might help isolate the problem. If the issue only occurs with larger bitmaps, then it's likely related to how they're being processed during migration.

Finally, I should consider if there are alternative methods or tools that handle large migrations more efficiently, or if adjusting the block size or bitmap granularity could alleviate the problem.

The VM migration is stuck in an active state due to a large dirty bitmap causing inefficiencies. Here's a step-by-step explanation and solution:

1. **Issue Identification**:
   - The migration status remains "active" indefinitely, indicating it isn't completing despite data transfer seeming complete.
   - A high number of dirty-sync-count (7,909,410) suggests excessive dirty page handling inefficiency.

2. **Analysis of Parameters and Capabilities**:
   - **block-incremental**: Set to false, leading to full syncs instead of deltas.
   - **Compression Settings**: Low compression level and threads may slow data processing.
   - **Network Performance**: Actual transfer rate (3.5 mbps) is much lower than the set max-bandwidth.

3. **Proposed Solution**:
   - **Enable Block Incremental Mode**: This allows sending only deltas after initial transfer, reducing redundant data handling.
   - **Adjust Compression Settings**: Increase threads and level to speed up data processing.
   - **Optimize Dirty Bitmap Handling**: Ensure bitmap granularity aligns with block size for efficiency.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Modify migrate parameters to enable `block-incremental`.
   - Adjust compression settings for better performance.
   - Verify and adjust the dirty bitmap handling mechanism if necessary.

5. **Expected Outcome**:
   - Migration should transition from "active" to "completed" after these adjustments, resolving the indefinite hanging issue.

By making these changes, the migration process will handle data more efficiently, allowing it to complete successfully without getting stuck in an active state due to large dirty bitmaps.
