Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is having trouble with the trace option in QEMU when using the UST backend. They mentioned that specifying --enable-trace-backends=ust should not require the "events" and "file" options because those aren't used with UST.

Looking at their examples, when they run QEMU without events or file, it fails with an invalid parameter error for '-m'. But when they include events=dummy-events.txt, it works. So the issue is that even though UST doesn't need these options, the current setup still requires them, which is incorrect.

Now, considering the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The problem seems related to how options are being handled, specifically for tracing backends. It's not a direct issue with the translation between architectures (so not mistranslation), nor is it an assembly or low-level code issue like device drivers. The bug lies in how command-line arguments are processed when using UST. 

Since this involves option handling and configuration rather than specific areas like network, graphics, or VNC, the most fitting category seems to be "other". Alternatively, maybe "debug" since it's about tracing, but I think "other" is safer here because it's more about incorrect argument processing.
