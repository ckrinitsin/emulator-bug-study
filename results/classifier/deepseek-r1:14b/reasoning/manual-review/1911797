Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned that the HMP command `hostfwd_remove` isn't working when the VM is running. They successfully added a port forward with `hostfwd_add`, but trying to remove it returns 'invalid format'. 

First, I need to understand what each part of the commands does. The `hostfwd_add` and `hostfwd_remove` commands are used in QEMU for managing host port forwarding. These commands interact with the QEMU monitor, which handles device configurations.

The bug occurs specifically when trying to remove a port forward from a running VM. Since the addition works, it's likely an issue with how the removal command is being handled by the monitor. The error message 'invalid format' suggests that the command string isn't parsed correctly, maybe due to a typo or incorrect syntax expected by QEMU.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, etc. Since port forwarding relates to networking and managing how ports are forwarded between host and guest, this falls under the 'network' category.

The bug is related to the handling of HMP commands for port forwarding in a running VM, which involves network configuration.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The issue occurs with HMP commands used for managing port forwarding (`hostfwd_add` and `hostfwd_remove`).
2. These commands are part of the QEMU monitor's functionality for handling network connections.
3. Since the problem is with the correct parsing or execution of these network-related commands, it falls under the 'network' category.

Answer: network
