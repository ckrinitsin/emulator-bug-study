Okay, I'm trying to figure out why the network traffic between VM1 and VM2 is getting interrupted. Let's start by looking at the information provided.

First, when someone pings 192.168.3.20 from another machine, they get a series of "Destination Host Unreachable" errors. That suggests that the packets aren't reaching their destination. The ping statistics show 100% packet loss, which is pretty severe. So something is definitely wrong with connectivity here.

Then there's an iperf test showing low bandwidth and some issues. The client didn't receive acks after several tries, indicating possible packet loss or a broken connection. This aligns with the ping resultsâ€”no data is getting through.

Looking at the output from VM2 when the enter key was pressed, it shows statistics for two ports. Port 0 has TX-packets:10 and RX-packets:0, while port 1 has RX-packets:10 and TX-packets:0. This seems like a mirror setup where data is being sent but not received back, or vice versa.

The additional info mentions that restarting the VM fixes traffic, which points to some configuration issue in DPDK perhaps. It also happens sometimes when stopping and starting dpdk-testpmd, which suggests it's related to how DPDK interfaces are managed.

Another case involves a multi-threaded DPDK application where one thread sends data over the network to the tap interface, and another handles data from the tap. Traffic stops after less than a minute without any reboots or interruptions, implying some resource might be getting exhausted or misconfigured in real-time.

So putting this together, it seems like the problem lies within the DPDK setup on VM2. The traffic is being mirrored but not correctly handled, leading to packet loss and eventually no data flow. It could be a configuration error in how ports are set up, maybe something wrong with the forwarding rules or buffer management causing packets to drop after some time.

I'm thinking that checking the DPDK port configurations would be a good first step. Maybe the setup isn't correctly handling both RX and TX on the right ports, leading to data not being processed properly. Also, resource limits or incorrect queue depths might cause the traffic to drop after a while, especially under load.

Another angle is to look into how the cores are handling the traffic in DPDK. If there's a misconfiguration in core assignments for RX and TX tasks, it could lead to packets getting stuck or not being processed correctly. Maybe one port isn't properly set up to handle incoming data while another is only sending out.

I should also consider any possible interferences with other network processes. Could firewalls or other network management tools be blocking the traffic? Or maybe there's an issue with VLAN settings if they're used here.

Overall, it looks like a misconfiguration in the DPDK setup on VM2 causing packets to not flow correctly, leading to high loss and eventual traffic stoppage. The solution would involve reviewing the port configurations, ensuring proper handling of RX and TX on each port, and checking for any resource constraints or threading issues that might be causing the instability.

The issue arises from a misconfiguration in the DPDK setup within VM2, leading to network packet loss and eventual traffic interruption. Here's a structured approach to diagnose and resolve the problem:

### Diagnosis:
1. **Network Connectivity Issues**: The ping test shows 100% packet loss, indicating that packets are not reaching their destination.
2. **Mirror Setup Misconfiguration**: The VM2 statistics reveal TX/RX imbalance across ports, suggesting an incorrect mirroring setup where data isn't being processed correctly.
3. **DPDK Configuration Flaws**: Likely issues include improper port configuration, core assignments for RX/TX tasks, or buffer management leading to packet loss and traffic stoppage.

### Solution Steps:

1. **Review DPDK Port Configurations**:
   - Ensure each port is correctly assigned to handle both RX and TX tasks as needed.
   - Verify that mirroring is set up properly without causing data loopbacks or drops.

2. **Check Core Assignments**:
   - Confirm that RX and TX tasks are assigned to the correct cores.
   - Balance the load appropriately to prevent resource exhaustion, especially under high traffic conditions.

3. **Inspect Buffer Management**:
   - Adjust buffer sizes to handle expected traffic volumes without causing overflow or underflow issues.
   - Monitor queue depths and ensure they are sufficient for continuous data flow.

4. **Resource Constraints**:
   - Check for any resource limits (CPU, memory) that might be constraining DPDK operations.
   - Optimize resource allocation to prevent bottlenecks during high load.

5. **Network Interference**:
   - Ensure no firewalls or network management tools are blocking traffic between VM1 and VM2.
   - Verify VLAN settings if they're in use, ensuring correct tagging and trunking configurations.

6. **Reconfiguration Testing**:
   - After making changes, test the setup thoroughly using ping, iperf, and other tools to confirm connectivity and performance improvements.

### Conclusion:
The problem stems from a misconfigured DPDK environment on VM2, leading to packet loss and traffic interruptions. By carefully reviewing port configurations, core assignments, buffer management, and resource utilization, along with ensuring no external network interference, the setup can be optimized for stable and reliable network traffic between VM1 and VM2.
