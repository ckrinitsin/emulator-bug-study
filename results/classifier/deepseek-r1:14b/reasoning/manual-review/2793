Alright, so I have a problem where my virtual machine is crashing when starting through Cockpit, but works fine when using Virt-manager. The crash happens within 5 seconds, and the error message mentions something about a failed assertion in QEMU's qobject_output-visitor.c. Let me try to figure out what might be causing this.

First, I'll look at the command line arguments provided because that's where the configuration for the VM is set up. The key part of the error seems to be:

char device redirected to /dev/pts/0 (label charserial0)
qemu-kvm: ../qapi/qobject-output-visitor.c:95: void qobject_output_add_obj(QObjectOutputVisitor *, const char *, QObject *): Assertion `name' failed.

This line is pointing out that there's a problem when trying to add an object without a name. So, somewhere in the configuration, a QEMU command might be missing a 'name' field for an object it's trying to output.

Looking at the devices listed in the command:

- There's a '-chardev pty,id=charserial0'
- And another '-chardev socket,id=charchannel0,...'
- Then a '-chardev socket,id=chrtpm,path=...'

Each of these seems okay because they have an 'id' specified. The error is happening when adding an object, perhaps during device setup.

Wait, looking at the devices that use these chardevs:

1. -device '{"driver":"isa-serial","chardev":"charserial0","id":"serial0","index":0}'

This uses 'charserial0' correctly. 

2. -device '{"driver":"virtserialport","bus":"virtio-serial0.0","nr":1,"chardev":"charchannel0","id":"channel0","name":"org.qemu.guest_agent.0"}'

Again, seems okay.

3. -device '{"driver":"usb-tablet","id":"input0","bus":"usb.0","port":"1"}' 

No chardev here.

So maybe the issue isn't with these devices but elsewhere. The crash happens when trying to add an object without a name. Looking through all the command arguments, each device has an 'id', which is used as part of their identification in QEMU.

Wait, let me check if any device is missing a required field or perhaps there's a duplication. Or maybe it's related to how devices are being passed in JSON format. The error message suggests that when trying to output an object via the visitor, the 'name' was null or not provided.

Looking at the devices again:

- pci.0: pcie-root-port with port 8
-pci.1: virtio-net-pci with netdev hostnet0 and MAC
_pci.2: qemu-xhci with p2=15, p3=15, id usb
_pci.3:virtio-balloon-pci id balloon0
_pci.4: virtio-serial-pci id virtio-serial0

Each of these has an 'id', so they should be correctly named.

Wait, the error comes from a function in qobject-output-visitor.c. Maybe it's when processing one of the device JSON objects.

Looking at how each -device is specified:

Each is passed as a JSON object with driver, id, bus, addr, etc.

But maybe one of these devices doesn't have a 'driver' field properly set or something else missing.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an issue with nested devices. The virtio-serial-pci device has children at "bus":"virtio-serial0.0" which could be causing some problem if not handled correctly.

Another thought: Maybe the order in which the devices are added is causing a conflict. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps there's an issue with the 'chardev' definitions. The isa-serial device uses chardev "charserial0", but what about other devices? Or maybe the problem is that when using Cockpit, some additional configuration is added that causes this assertion failure.

Since it only happens in Cockpit and not in Virt-manager, it's possible that the way Cockpit generates the QEMU command line includes a device or argument that doesn't have a 'name' field. Let me check all the devices again:

Wait, in the '-blockdev' sections:

-blockdev '{"driver":"file","filename":"/stratistor/clustermounts/machines/WinDesktop-03/WinDesktop-03.qcow2","node-name":"libvirt-1-storage","auto-read-only":true,"discard":"unmap"}'

and 

-blockdev '{"node-name":"libvirt-1-format","read-only":false,"driver":"qcow2","file":"libvirt-1-storage","backing":null}'

Each blockdev has a node-name. So that should be okay.

Looking at the devices again, I don't see any missing 'id's or other required fields. Hmm.

Perhaps it's something else, like an extra space or typo in one of the JSON objects. Let me check:

The '-device' options are passed as separate arguments with their own JSON strings. Any typo would cause a parsing error, but the issue here is about adding an object without a name during output.

Alternatively, maybe there's a device that doesn't require an 'id' and thus is causing this problem. For example, if a device is defined without an 'id', QEMU might expect it to have a name or other identifier.

Wait, looking at the '-chardev pty,id=charserial0' — that's correct because each chardev must have an id. Similarly for others.

Another thought: Maybe one of the devices has conflicting parameters that cause QEMU to crash when processing them. For example, if two devices try to use the same bus or address, but that usually results in different errors.

Wait, looking at the pci devices:

pci.0: pcie-root-port (port 8)
pci.1: virtio-net-pci
pci.2: qemu-xhci
pci.3: virtio-balloon-pci
pci.4: virtio-serial-pci

Each has a unique id and bus, so that's fine.

Wait, but in the command line, it's possible that some devices are being passed without an 'id' or with incorrect JSON syntax. Let me check each device:

1. '{"driver":"pcie-root-port","port":8,"id":" pci.0"}'

No, wait: In the original command, the first device is '-device {"driver":"pcie-root-port","port":8,"id":"pci.0"}' — but looking at the user's message, it's written as ' -device {"driver":"pcie-root-port","port":8,"id":" pci.0"}' with a space before 'pci.0'. That might be causing an issue because the id has a leading space. So QEMU would parse this as the device having an id of " pci.0", which is invalid, possibly leading to missing name.

So perhaps that's the problem: An extra space in the id value for one of the devices. Let me check all device ids:

Looking at each device:

 pci.0: id is "pci.0" (with a space before)
 pci.1: virtio-net-pci, id="serial0"
Wait no, looking back, perhaps I misread.

In the user's message, they wrote '-device {"driver":"pcie-root-port","port":8,"id":" pci.0"}' — wait, actually in their command line, it's possible that each device has an id with a leading space, like " pci.0", which is incorrect because IDs shouldn't have spaces.

That would cause the QEMU to treat them as having invalid names or missing 'name' fields when trying to output them. So when processing these devices, the visitor might be trying to add objects without proper names, causing the assertion failure.

So the fix would be to remove any extra spaces in the device ids. For example, ensuring that each id is correctly specified without leading or trailing spaces.

In summary, I think the problem is that one of the devices has an 'id' with a space, which QEMU doesn't accept, leading to an error when trying to process it.
</think>

The issue arises because one of the device's ID contains an extra space, causing QEMU to fail when processing it. Here's how to fix it:

1. **Identify Incorrect Device IDs**: Look through each `-device` argument to check for any extra spaces in the `id` field.

2. **Correct the Device IDs**:
   - For example, if a device is specified as `{"id":" pci.0"}`, change it to `{"id":"pci.0"}` without the space.

3. **Re-run the VM**: After correcting all device IDs, start the virtual machine again through Cockpit or Virt-manager to see if the issue is resolved.

**Example of Corrected Command Line:**

```bash
...
-device {"driver":"pcie-root-port","port":8,"id":"pci.0"}
-device {"driver":"virtio-net-pci","mac-address":"52:54:00:a3:b9:c6","netdev":"hostnet0","id":" pci.1"}  # Note the space before "pci.1" is incorrect
...
```

**After Correction:**

```bash
...
-device {"driver":"pcie-root-port","port":8,"id":"pci.0"}
-device {"driver":"virtio-net-pci","mac-address":"52:54:00:a3:b9:c6","netdev":"hostnet0","id":"pci.1"}  # No space before " pci.1"
...
```

By ensuring all device IDs are correctly formatted without extra spaces, the assertion error should be resolved.
