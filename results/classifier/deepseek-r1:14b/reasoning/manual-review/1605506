Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. So the user is having an issue when using `drive_mirror` in QEMU. They ran it once and got an error saying "Operation not permitted" with a return value of -1. Then they re-ran the VM and debugged it again, this time getting a ret value of 16 instead.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what each part means. 

First, in the initial run, when `drive_mirror` was used, the system tried to open `/dev/vg_bc_local/test`. The code went into `raw_open_common`, called `qemu_open`, which then made a system call to `open()`. In that first case, the return value was -1, and the error was "Operation not permitted". That suggests that the process didn't have the necessary permissions to open that device.

But in the second run, the same code path was followed, but this time the return value was 16. I wonder what 16 represents. Let me check the possible values for `open()` errors. Oh right, in Unix systems, the error codes are typically defined in `<errno.h>`. A quick look tells me that 16 is `EINPROGRESS`, but wait—that's usually related to network operations, not file I/O. Alternatively, maybe it's a different error code depending on the system.

Wait no, perhaps the user is using a 32-bit vs 64-bit environment? Or maybe it's an encoding issue where the actual error is being represented differently. Alternatively, maybe 16 isn't an error code but a valid file descriptor, like if `open()` succeeded and returned 16 as the fd.

But looking back at the context: in the first case, `ret` was -1 (which usually means failure), and in the second, it's 16. That suggests that maybe the second time, the operation actually succeeded because `ret` is a positive integer, which would be the file descriptor number.

Wait a minute—this seems inconsistent. Let me check how `qemu_open()` handles the return value. In QEMU's `osdep.c`, when it calls `open()`, if it's successful, it returns the file descriptor. If not, it might set `errno` and return -1. So in the first run, it failed, returning -1, but in the second, it succeeded with fd 16.

Why would that happen? Maybe because in the second run, the user had the correct permissions or the device was accessible. Or perhaps during the first attempt, there was an issue like the device not existing, while in the second it did.

But wait, both runs were trying to mirror the same drive to the same target `/dev/vg_bc_local/test`. The only difference is that the first time it failed with permission denied, and the second time it succeeded. Or perhaps there was a change between the two runs—maybe the user adjusted permissions or switched users.

Alternatively, maybe the first run wasn't using QEMU's debug build, so when the error occurred, it didn't handle it properly, but in the second run, with the debug build, it could proceed because the necessary setup was done elsewhere.

Wait no, looking at the GDB output: the second run actually succeeded in opening the file. So maybe the first time, due to some misconfiguration or incorrect user permissions, the open failed, but on re-running after fixing something, it worked.

But then why did the user include both debug outputs? It seems like they ran `drive_mirror` once and got an error, then set up GDB breakpoints, and when they ran again, they stepped through and saw that it actually succeeded. So maybe their initial problem was a one-time issue, and upon re-running with proper setup, it worked.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to understand why sometimes `drive_mirror` works and other times not, but from the logs, it's clear that in the second attempt, after setting up GDB breakpoints, the open succeeded because ret was 16 (assuming 16 is a valid file descriptor). 

But wait, what if the initial failure was due to some condition like the device being in use or permissions not set correctly. Maybe when they ran it again, perhaps as root, or with proper permissions, it worked.

So putting this together: The user tried `drive_mirror`, got an "Operation not permitted" error because the process didn't have enough privileges to open the target device. Upon re-running the VM as a user with sufficient permissions (like root), they were able to open the device successfully, hence the ret value of 16 indicating success.

Therefore, the problem was likely due to insufficient permissions during the first attempt. Once the user ensured that QEMU had the necessary access rights, `drive_mirror` worked correctly.

The issue you encountered with `drive_mirror` is related to insufficient permissions when trying to open the target device `/dev/vg_bc_local/test`. Here's a breakdown of what happened and how to resolve it:

1. **Initial Failure**: 
   - When you ran `drive_mirror`, QEMU attempted to open the specified device but was denied access, resulting in an "Operation not permitted" error (`errno: 1`).
   - This indicates that the user account running QEMU did not have sufficient permissions to access the device.

2. **Successful Run with Debugging**:
   - Upon re-running the VM and stepping through with GDB, you observed a return value of `16` when attempting to open the device.
   - The successful `open()` system call returned a valid file descriptor (16), which means the operation was allowed this time.

3. **Resolution**:
   - Ensure that the user account under which QEMU is running has read/write permissions for the target device `/dev/vg_bc_local/test`.
   - You might need to run QEMU as root or adjust the device's permissions and ownership to allow access for your user.

In summary, the issue was a permission problem during the initial attempt. After ensuring proper permissions, `drive_mirror` worked correctly.
