Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is dealing with a QEMU/KVM virtual machine setup and has encountered some issues.

First, looking at the initial error when running `qemu-img info --backing-chain 3.qcow2`. The error message says that the block format 'qcow2' doesn't support the option 'backing.backing.driver'. That suggests there's a problem with how the backing files are structured. Maybe the JSON configuration for the backing chain is incorrect or not supported by QEMU.

Then, I see the user ran `qemu-img rebase` to fix it. The command was: `-f qcow2 -F qcow2 -u -b 2.qcow2 3.qcow2`. This tells me they're trying to update (the '-u' flag) the backing file of 3.qcow2 to point to 2.qcow2, both in qcow2 format. 

After running this command, the `qemu-img info` output shows that the backing chain now correctly points from 3.qcow2 to 2.qcow2. The disk sizes are small (24 KiB each), which makes sense if these are just snapshots or sparse files without much data written yet.

So, putting it together: the user had a nested JSON configuration for their backing files that QEMU couldn't parse correctly, leading to errors when trying to inspect the images. They used `qemu-img rebase` to flatten this structure, pointing 3.qcow2 directly to 2.qcow2 as its backing file, which resolved the issue.

I think the key steps here were identifying the incorrect JSON structure causing the error and then using the right `rebase` command to simplify the backing chain. This fixed the problem without needing to recreate the images from scratch.

The error you encountered is related to an invalid or unsupported JSON configuration for a QEMU/KVM virtual machine's backing file chain. The issue arises when trying to parse or inspect the nested JSON structure describing the backing files.

### Key Points:
1. **Error Analysis**:
   - The error message indicates that the block format 'qcow2' does not support the option 'backing.backing.driver'. This suggests that the way the backing chain is defined in your JSON configuration might be incorrect or incompatible with QEMU's expected structure.
   
2. **Solution**:
   - You resolved the issue by running `qemu-img rebase` to update the backing file of `3.qcow2` to point directly to `2.qcow2`. This simplified the backing chain and made it compatible with QEMU's requirements.

### Final Output:
```json
image: 3.qcow2
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 64 GiB (68719476736 bytes)
disk size: 24 KiB
cluster_size: 65536
backing file: 2.qcow2
backing file format: qcow2
Format specific information:
    compat: 1.1
    compression type: zlib
    lazy refcounts: false
    refcount bits: 16
    corrupt: false
    extended l2: false
```

### Explanation:
- The `qemu-img rebase` command was used to flatten the backing chain, ensuring that `3.qcow2` directly references `2.qcow2` as its backing file.
- This simplified structure avoids the nested JSON configuration and ensures compatibility with QEMU's expected format.

In summary, running the `qemu-img rebase` command successfully fixed the issue by updating the backing file reference in `3.qcow2`.
