Alright, I'm trying to figure out why some QEMU targets are causing segmentation faults or crashes while others run fine. Let's go through each architecture one by one based on the information provided.

First, looking at Sparc64, when using QEMU it works if I set the LD_PREFIX correctly but fails otherwise. However, when I copy the binary to a machine with the right kernel and environment, it runs. This suggests that perhaps the setup in the chroot is correct for Sparc64, so maybe similar fixes can be applied to other architectures.

For MIPS, both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are problematic under QEMU but work on actual hardware. That's odd because I thought QEMU handles MIPS well. Maybe there's an issue with the specific QEMU version or how it's configured. Perhaps checking if the QEMU binary is correctly set up for MIPS, maybe using the right CPU type or some missing kernel parameters.

Looking at PowerPC and PowerPC64 targets, both have similar issues as MIPS. The binaries run on real hardware but crash in QEMU. Maybe there are specific flags or configurations needed when running these under QEMU that aren't being set correctly. I should check if the LD_PREFIX is pointing to the right libraries and if any additional QEMU options are necessary.

For s390x, it's hanging with one QEMU version but fails with an assertion error in another. This might be a bug specific to certain versions of QEMU for this architecture. Updating or downgrading QEMU could help, or perhaps there's a known issue that needs patching.

The HP PA-RISC and m68k targets are also failing, each with different errors. For HP-PA, it's a segmentation fault, while for m68k, it's an illegal instruction. These might be due to either incorrect emulation settings or missing support in the QEMU version being used. Maybe I need to look into specific QEMU options for these architectures or ensure that the necessary kernel modules are loaded.

Since the user mentioned that the set of targets where it doesn't work is exactly the big-endian targets, this points towards a possible endianness issue in how QEMU handles these architectures. Perhaps some of these targets require explicit handling of byte order or specific compilation flags when building binaries for them under little-endian systems like Linux x86_64.

I should also consider if there are any missing dependencies or libraries that the binary relies on, which might not be properly set up in the QEMU environment. Using strace or ltrace could help identify where the process is failingâ€”whether it's during the initial load of the binary or accessing certain shared objects.

Another angle is to check if all these architectures are correctly supported by the installed version of QEMU. Sometimes, certain targets require additional build options or patches. Compiling QEMU from source with specific configurations might be necessary for some architectures like s390x or HP-PA.

Finally, it's worth checking the QEMU documentation and community forums to see if others have encountered similar issues with these architectures. There might be known workarounds or patches that can be applied to make the binaries run smoothly under QEMU.

The issue arises because some architectures require specific configurations or dependencies when running under QEMU, particularly for big-endian targets like Sparc64, MIPS, PowerPC, and others. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this:

1. **Set Up QEMU Correctly:**
   - Ensure that you have the correct QEMU binary for each target architecture.
   - Verify that the `QEMU_LD_PREFIX` is set correctly to point to the appropriate libraries (e.g., `/usr/mips-linux-gnu` for MIPS).

2. **Use Chroot or Container:**
   - Run the binaries in a chroot environment with their native root filesystems to mimic their actual execution environments.

3. **Check Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that all necessary shared libraries are present and correctly linked in the target's environment.
   - Use `ldd` to check if any dependencies are missing or incorrect.

4. **Verify QEMU Version:**
   - Some architectures may require specific versions of QEMU. Update or downgrade as needed, especially for s390x which showed issues with certain versions.

5. **Adjust CPU and Kernel Parameters:**
   - For MIPS, specify the correct CPU type (e.g., `qemu-mips -cpu mips64`).
   - Ensure that the target kernel is compatible and properly configured when running in QEMU.

6. **Handle Endianness:**
   - Explicitly manage byte order if necessary, though this should usually be handled by QEMU automatically for most architectures.

7. **Test with Native Execution:**
   - Before troubleshooting under QEMU, confirm that the binary runs correctly on native hardware to isolate whether the issue is specific to QEMU or a broader problem.

8. **Check for Known Issues:**
   - Look up QEMU's issue tracker or community forums for known bugs related to your target architectures and apply any available patches.

9. **Use Debugging Tools:**
   - Use `strace`, `gdb`, or similar tools to identify where the process is failing in more detail, which can provide clues about missing libraries, incorrect mappings, or other runtime issues.

By systematically addressing each architecture's specific requirements and ensuring that QEMU is properly configured with all necessary dependencies and flags, you should be able to resolve the segmentation faults and get these binaries running smoothly under QEMU.
