Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "Cirrus video, graphical corruption, bad fonts". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the bug report, it mentions Cirrus video and issues with graphical corruption and bad fonts. Cirrus is known for producing graphics chips used in QEMU's VGA drivers, so this seems related to the graphics display. The terms "graphical corruption" and "bad fonts" directly point to problems with how graphics are being rendered or displayed.

The category options include 'graphic', which fits perfectly here because the issues are clearly graphical in nature. Other categories like device might be possible since Cirrus is a hardware device, but the specific symptoms relate more to the visual output rather than hardware device functionality in general.

So, the most appropriate classification is 'graphic'.
