Okay, I'm trying to figure out this problem where dereferencing a non-canonical address through the stack causes a #PF (page fault) instead of a #SS (stack segment violation). The user mentioned that they expected a #SS but got a #PF, and now they're reconsidering life. Hmm, interesting.

First, I need to understand what each exception means. A #SS error occurs when an instruction tries to access the stack segment (SS) in a way that's not allowed by the current CPU state. This can happen if the address isn't canonical or if there's an issue with the segment registers. On the other hand, a #PF is triggered when a memory access causes a page fault because the required page isn't loaded into physical memory.

The provided output shows that the exception changed from 0xFFFFFFFF (which would be a double fault maybe?) to 0xE, which corresponds to an invalid opcode exception (#UD). Wait, noâ€”looking at the start, it says "check_exception old: 0xffffffff new 0xe". So initially, the exception was something else (probably a #SS), but after some change, it's now 0xE. But 0xE is actually the vector for an invalid opcode (#UD). That doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, let me check. In x86, exceptions have vectors: #PF is 14 (0xD in hex), #SS is 17 (0x11 in hex). So maybe there was a miscalculation here. Let me double-check the initial part of the output.

The user says they expected a #SS but got a #PF, so let's focus on that scenario. So when you try to dereference a non-canonical address through the stack, instead of getting a #SS (segment violation), it's causing a page fault. Why would that happen?

I know that in 64-bit mode, the concept of segments is mostly ignored for user-space code because of the flat memory model. So perhaps when you're running in QEMU under Linux with KVM or something, certain exceptions are emulated differently.

Wait, non-canonical addresses in 64-bit mode can still cause exceptions if they're accessed in a way that doesn't fit the canonical form (like having the high bit set for addresses above 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFF). But in practice, when you try to access such an address via the stack, the CPU might generate a #PF because it's trying to handle the page translation before checking segment registers.

So maybe the code is causing a memory access that hits a non-canonical address, which triggers a page fault instead of a segment violation. That makes sense because in modern OSes and virtualized environments, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) checks pages first before handling segments, especially in 64-bit mode where segments are less relevant.

The user's steps to reproduce involve dereferencing a non-canonical address through the stack. So perhaps they're pushing such an address onto the stack and then trying to access it. But when the CPU tries to read that address, it checks if the page is present in memory (which it isn't), hence causing a #PF.

But why wouldn't it generate a #SS? Maybe because in this context, the MMU translation fails before segment checking can occur. So instead of a segment violation, you get a page fault because the kernel or hypervisor handles the memory access first.

The output also shows that after dereferencing, there's an exception change from 0xFFFFFFFF to 0xE. I think 0xE is for an invalid opcode (#UD). That might be due to some other instruction causing an issue after the initial access. Alternatively, maybe the non-canonical address leads to a different kind of error.

So putting this together: when you try to access a non-canonical stack address, the CPU first checks if the page exists. If it doesn't (like in QEMU's emulation where certain pages aren't mapped), it throws a #PF. The fact that it was expecting a #SS suggests they were perhaps using 16-bit or 32-bit code where segment checks are more relevant.

In conclusion, when accessing non-canonical addresses through the stack in a 64-bit environment (especially under QEMU), you're likely to hit a page fault before any segment checks. This is because MMU operations take precedence in the CPU's exception handling flow.

When dereferencing a non-canonical address through the stack, the CPU typically triggers a #PF (page fault) instead of a #SS (segmentation violation) due to the order of exception handling in modern architectures, particularly in 64-bit environments. Here's why:

1. **Page Fault Precedence**: The MMU checks for valid page translations before segment checks. If the address is non-canonical but refers to an unmapped or invalid page, a #PF occurs.

2. **64-Bit Environment**: In 64-bit mode, segments are less relevant in user space due to the flat memory model. Non-canonical addresses often cause page faults rather than segmentation errors.

3. **Virtualization Context**: Under QEMU/KVM, certain addresses may not be mapped, leading to #PFs during emulation, bypassing segment checks.

**Conclusion**: In 64-bit environments or virtualized setups like QEMU, accessing non-canonical stack addresses results in a page fault because the MMU's translation process occurs before any segmentation checks.
