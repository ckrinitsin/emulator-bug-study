Okay, let's try to figure out why the login failed and the VM shut down. 

First, I see that there were multiple attempts to connect via SSH to 192.168.122.195 on port 22, but each time it was refused. That suggests that either the server isn't running, the port is blocked, or the credentials are wrong.

I should check if the VM is actually running and accepting connections. Maybe there's an issue with how the VM was started. I'll look into the VM's status to see if it's up and responsive.

Next, network settings could be a problem. Perhaps the VM isn't assigned the correct IP address or there's a firewall blocking port 22. I'll need to verify the VM's networking configuration and ensure that the host allows SSH traffic on port 22.

Also, the SSH credentials might be incorrect. The attempts were using root with no password, but maybe the root account isn't set up for SSH login or there's a different username and password required. It would help to confirm the correct login details for the VM.

If the VM is running, I should try connecting from another network interface or check if there are any firewall rules on both the host and guest machines blocking the connection.

Lastly, it might be useful to look at the logs from the VM's SSH server to see if there are any additional error messages that could provide more insight into why the connection is being refused.

The issue arises because the SSH connection to the VM is being refused. Here's a step-by-step explanation and solution:

1. **Identify the Problem**: The login attempts to `root@192.168.122.195` on port 22 are failing with "Connection refused." This indicates that either the VM isn't running, SSH isn't listening on port 22, or network access is blocked.

2. **Check VM Status**: Ensure the VM (`vm1`) is properly started and responsive. If it's down, start it and monitor its boot process to confirm services are running.

3. **Verify Network Configuration**:
   - Check if the VM has the correct IP address assigned.
   - Confirm that port 22 on the VM isn't blocked by a firewall or network settings.

4. **Review SSH Credentials**: 
   - Ensure the root account is enabled for SSH login in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
   - Verify that the correct username and password (or SSH key) are being used for authentication.

5. **Inspect Logs**:
   - On the host, check firewall logs (`iptables` or `firewalld`) to ensure port 22 is allowed.
   - On the VM, examine `/var/log/auth.log` or SSH server logs for connection attempts and any errors.

6. **Troubleshoot Connectivity**: Use tools like `telnet` from another machine to test if port 22 is open on the VM:
   ```bash
   telnet 192.168.122.195 22
   ```
   If this fails, there's a network issue; if it succeeds, check SSH configuration.

7. **Restart Services**: After addressing potential issues, restart the SSH service on the VM:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

8. **Attempt Reconnection**: Once the above steps are done, try logging in again to see if the issue is resolved.

**Solution Summary**:

- Ensure the VM is running and network settings permit access.
- Validate SSH configuration and credentials on the VM.
- Check firewall and network policies for port 22 accessibility.
- Restart relevant services as needed and attempt reconnection.
