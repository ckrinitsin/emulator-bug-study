Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's see what the problem is.

The user mentioned that analyze-migration.py doesn't account for saved blocks and provided a traceback with a KeyError related to ('block', 0). The additional info includes pseudocode from block_load in migration/block.c, which deals with reading sector numbers, flags, device names, etc. 

Looking at the categories: 'block' relates directly to disk or storage operations. The issue seems to be with how block devices are handled during migration. Since it's about saved blocks and migration involves moving disk data, this falls under the 'block' category.

The bug is related to handling block device data during migration, so the appropriate category is:

block
