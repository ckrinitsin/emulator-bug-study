Okay, I'm looking at this bug report about KVM and VHD files over 127GB. The user is having trouble converting these large VHDs using kvm-img. From the details, it seems like when they try to convert a VHD larger than 127GB, the process only goes up to that limit, and no error is shown. They also mention that VirtualBox handles this correctly, so there's an issue with how KVM or kvm-img processes these files.

I know that KVM relies on QEMU for disk image handling, including conversions. The bug report points out two main issues: KVM can't handle dynamic VHDs larger than 127GB, and the conversion tool doesn't inform the user about this limitation properly.

Looking at the classification options—kernel modules, filesystems/devices, networking, etc.—I think this falls under filesystem/device because it's related to disk images and their handling. It's not a kernel module issue directly but more about how KVM/QEMU interacts with these image formats.

So, the appropriate category is filesystem/devices.

The bug report describes an issue where KVM cannot properly handle dynamic VHD files larger than 127GB, and kvm-img doesn't generate an error when conversion fails. This relates to filesystem/device handling in QEMU/KVM, as it's about disk image processing limitations.

**Answer:** The classification is under **filesystem/devices**.
