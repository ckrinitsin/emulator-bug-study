It looks like you're trying to configure a build for QEMU with several options enabled and disabled. Based on the flags provided, here's what it seems to be doing:

### Disabled Features:
- **Audio/Video:** Disabling various audio (e.g., `--disable-alsa`, `--disable-coreaudio`) and video-related backends.
- **Storage Formats:** Disabling support for various storage formats like VMDK, VHDX, Qcow1, etc.
- **Compression:** Disabling compression algorithms such as Bzip2, LZFSE, Snappy, LZO.
- **Networking:** Disabling network-related features like Netmap and L2TPv3.
- **Security/Authentication:** Disabling authentication methods like PAM, Keyring, SELinux, U2F, etc.
- **Guest Agent:** Disabling guest agent support for both MSI and regular.
- **Plugins and Tools:** Disabling various plugins, replication, and tools.
- **UserModes:Disabling BSD-user and Linux-user modes.
- **Other Features:** Disabling features like Capstone, Gettext, Iconv, etc.

### Enabled Features:
- **KVM/QEMU System Emulator:** Enabling KVM for virtualization and QEMU system emulator (`--enable-kvm`, `--enable-system`).
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Enabling PIE (Position Independent Executable), LTO (Link-Time Optimization), and AF_XDP.
  - Compiling with optimizations like `-O2`, function alignment, and various compiler flags for performance.
- **Networking:** Enabling Slirp, Vhost-kernel, Vhost-net, Vhost-user, and Vhost-Vdpa.
- **Coroutines and Memory Management:** Enabling coroutine pool, Linux AIO, Linux IO-Uring, Malloc Trim, Membarrier, and Cap-ng.
- **Security:** Enabling Seccomp and Stack Protector Strong for security hardening.
- **Other Features:** Enabling TPM, Zstd (for compression), NUMA support, FDT disabled, and others.

### Compiler Flags:
The build is using several compiler flags to optimize performance, enable security features, and ensure compatibility. For example:
- `-O2` for optimization level 2.
- `-fno-semantic-interposition` to disable function inlining for better binary size.
- `-flto=auto` for link-time optimizations.

### Linker Flags:
The linker is configured with flags like `-Wl,-z,noexecstack` for security, and `-Wl,-O1` for optimization. It also uses `--as-needed` to reduce unnecessary dependencies.

### CPU Compatibility:
- The build targets x86 CPUs with version 4 (`--x86-version=4`), which might optimize for newer Intel/AMD processors.

### Summary:
This configuration seems tailored for a lightweight, high-performance QEMU build focused on virtualization without audio/video support or many plugins. It prioritizes security and performance optimizations while disabling unnecessary features.
