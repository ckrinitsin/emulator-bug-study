Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user provided an example where creating a QCOW2 image always results in compression being enabled, which isn't desired.

Looking at the possible categories: 'mistranslation', 'assembly', and others like 'device', 'graphic', etc. The issue is about the behavior of `qemu-img`, specifically related to how it handles QCOW2 images. Since the problem is that compression can't be disabled, even though the format allows it, this seems like a feature request or a missing option in the tool.

The bug report doesn't involve incorrect semantic mapping from source architecture to IR/target (which would be 'mistranslation'), nor does it relate to assembly lowering ('assembly'). It's more about the functionality of `qemu-img` regarding image creation options. So, none of the specific categories like 'device', 'graphic', etc., seem to fit.

The closest category that fits this issue is probably 'other' because it doesn't fall neatly into any of the provided technical areas but relates to how the tool operates.
