Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The report mentions that a new dependency on GCC 7.5.0 allows any version of GCC 7. 

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about GCC version compatibility in QEMU. Since it's related to build dependencies and compiler versions, none of the specific categories like 'network' or 'vnc' apply. It doesn't fall under performance optimizations or other technical features directly. Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'other'.
