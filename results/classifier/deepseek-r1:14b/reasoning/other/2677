Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "edit doc on building". The user provided several categories, and I should choose one based on that.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report mentions editing documentation related to building. It doesn't fit into any of the technical or functional categories like device or network. Building usually relates to compiling or setup, which might fall under documentation changes. Since "other" is a general category for things that don't fit elsewhere, this likely goes there.

The bug report about editing documentation on building falls under "other" since it's not related to any specific technical category but rather documentation.

**Answer:** other
