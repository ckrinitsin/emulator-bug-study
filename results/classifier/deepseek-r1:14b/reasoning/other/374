Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

The bug report says, "Indentation should be done with spaces, not with TABs, in the PPC subsystem." So it's about code formattingâ€”specifically, how indentation is handled. 

Looking at the categories, most of them are related to functionality rather than coding style. Indentation issues usually fall under code quality or style, but none of the provided categories directly mention that.

The possible options include 'other' which covers things not explicitly listed. Since this isn't about any specific feature like network, device, or KVM, it's best categorized under 'other'.
