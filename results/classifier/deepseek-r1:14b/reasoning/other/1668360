Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The issue is about a documentation error where a link returns a 404 not found.

First, looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report mentions a documentation page having an incorrect link. This isn't related to any specific component like KVM or networking. It's about the documentation itself, which doesn't fit into the other categories provided except possibly 'other'.

Therefore, this seems to fall under 'other' because it's not related to any of the technical areas listed but is a documentation issue.
