Alright, let's see. The user provided a bug report about QEMU and wants me to classify it into one of several categories.

The bug report says: "New Cocoa clipboard support raises minimum macos version to 10.14"

I need to figure out which category this falls under. Let's look at the options again:

- mistranslation
- assembly
- other
- device
- graphic
- socket
- network
- KVM
- boot
- vnc
- debug
- files
- permissions
- performance
- kernel
- peripherals
- hypervisor

The issue is about adding new Cocoa clipboard support, which affects the minimum macOS version required. This seems related to the graphical interface or system integration on macOS. However, "graphic" might be more about rendering graphics, not necessarily system requirements.

Looking at the categories, "peripherals" could include input/output devices and their drivers, but I'm not sure if clipboard support falls under that. Alternatively, it's a system requirement change, which might fall under "other" since it's an update related to macOS compatibility rather than a specific component like network or KVM.

Wait, another thought: Since the change is about integrating with Cocoa for clipboard functionality and requires a higher macOS version, it's more of a system-level change. Maybe "other" is the safest bet as it doesn't clearly fit into the other categories provided.
