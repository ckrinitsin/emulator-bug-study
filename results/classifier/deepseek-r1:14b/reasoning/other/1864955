Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The user mentioned that the current setup requires installing QEMU first and then HAXM separately. They suggest bundling them together in the same installer for a better user experience on Windows.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and others like assembly or mistranslation. 

The issue is about installation and packaging of software components together. It doesn't relate to any specific subsystem like networking or graphics. Instead, it's more about how QEMU is distributed and set up on Windows systems.

Since the categories don't have a direct match for installer issues, I'll go with 'other' as it's not fitting into any of the predefined technical categories but relates to user experience during installation.
