Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. So, the user is reporting an issue when running `./configure` in QEMU on Ubuntu 14.10 amd64 with Linux 3.19.1. The error message says "ERROR: User requested feature nptl" and suggests installing glibc and kernel headers, but they've already installed those. 

First, I need to understand what the error is about. NPTL stands for Native Posix Thread Library, which is part of the GNU C Library (glibc). It's used for threading in Linux systems. So if configure is looking for nptl and can't find it, maybe there's an issue with how QEMU detects its availability.

The user points out that they have both `libglib2.0-dev` and kernel headers installed, so the error message might be misleading or incorrect. The problem isn't about missing dependencies but perhaps a misconfiguration in how QEMU checks for NPTL support.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation relates to incorrect mapping from source to target, which doesn't seem directly relevant here. Assembly lowering is about converting high-level code to assembly, not applicable either. Other is a catch-all, but I should check if there's a more specific category.

The error message itself is part of the configure script, which is responsible for checking system features and dependencies. This seems more like a configuration or build issue rather than something related to device drivers, graphics, networking, etc. The user isn't experiencing an issue with KVM, VNC, or any other hypervisor-related components.

The problem arises during the configuration phase, not runtime, so it's not about performance, kernel modules, or peripherals. Since the error is in the configure script's message, it's likely a bug in how dependencies are detected. Perhaps QEMU is incorrectly determining that NPTL isn't installed when it actually is, leading to an unnecessary or misleading error.

In this case, the issue doesn't fall into specific categories like device, graphic, network, etc., but rather relates to the build configuration and dependency detection. Therefore, the most appropriate category here would be "other" since it's not a direct feature of QEMU's core functionality but rather an issue with its setup and error messaging during compilation.
