Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read the bug report carefully.

The user ran 'make -j1 docker-test-build' and noticed that more than one job were being used. The command uses '-j1', which typically means make should use only one job. However, despite this setting, multiple containers are getting instantiated as shown by 'docker ps'. 

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue here is related to how Make is handling the build process. The command is using 'docker-test-build' and spawns multiple containers even with '-j1'. This seems like a problem with how the build jobs are being managed or how Docker is handling the container creation based on make's job settings.

I don't see any direct connection to translation, assembly lowering, or typical hardware-related categories. It's more about the build process using more resources than intended. 

The closest category might be 'other' since it doesn't fit into the specific listed ones like network, KVM, etc. Alternatively, maybe 'performance' could be a stretch if it's causing high resource usage, but I think 'other' is safer here.
