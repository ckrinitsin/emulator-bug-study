Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. Let's see what the problem is.

The user mentioned a "documentation error:404 not found." They provided two URLs that aren't working, both pointing to images on the QEMU wiki page. The issue here seems to be related to broken links or missing files in the documentation.

Looking at the list of possible categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, and others are technical issues within the code itself. Categories like device, graphic, socket, etc., relate more to hardware emulation or specific functionalities. There's also "other," which is a catch-all for things that don't fit elsewhere.

Since this bug report is about documentation links returning 404 errors, it doesn't fall under any of the technical categories related to code translation or device emulators. It's specifically an issue with the project's documentation resources not being accessible properly.

Therefore, the most appropriate category here would be "documentation error," but since that's not listed, I have to choose from the given options. The closest match is "other" because it's not a direct issue with QEMU's core functionalities or its codebase but rather an external resource problem.

The bug report deals with broken links in the documentation, which doesn't fit into any specific technical category like device or network issues. Instead, it's related to external resources.

**Answer:** other
