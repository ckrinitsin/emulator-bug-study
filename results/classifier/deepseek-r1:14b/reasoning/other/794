Okay, so I need to classify a bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. The categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

Looking at the bug report: it's about broken links in the changelog documentation pointing to removed features. Specifically, the links are going to an incorrect URL. The user encountered confusion while trying to find solutions for emulation issues due to these broken links.

Hmm, this doesn't seem related to any of the specific areas like network, KVM, or graphics. It's more about documentation and how the changelog is set up. The issue isn't with the code itself causing a bug in emulation but rather that some links are pointing to the wrong place in the documentation.

The categories given don't have a 'documentation' option. So I need to see which category fits best. 'Other' seems like the most appropriate since it's not fitting into any of the technical areas listed. The problem is more about documentation quality and structure rather than any specific feature or component.
