Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The user is reporting an issue with a static build of QEMU that includes the curses feature. When they run `configure` with `--enable-curses --static`, it fails because the configure script can't find the required libraries, specifically `-ltinfo`. Without this flag, the build process aborts, but adding `-ltinfo` manually allows the check to succeed.

Then, during compilation, there are linker errors related to undefined references like `COLS`, `LINES`, `stdscr`, and `curs_set`. These symbols are part of the ncurses library. The user also mentions that they tried a minimal build with various disables, but the issue persists.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The main problem here is that the static build isn't linking against `-ltinfo` properly, leading to missing symbols from ncurses. This seems to be a linking issue rather than a problem with QEMU's own code or features. Since it's about library linkage and not any specific component like networking or KVM, the most appropriate category would be 'other'. The issue isn't tied directly to any of the listed specific areas but is more about build configuration.

The bug report describes an issue where a static build of QEMU with curses fails due to missing libraries (-ltinfo) and undefined references in ncurses. This relates to linking issues rather than specific QEMU components, so it falls under 'other'.

**Answer:** other
