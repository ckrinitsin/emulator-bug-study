Alright, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is having trouble building QEMU-1.3.0 on Solaris 10 using a SPARC processor. They encountered several errors during the configure step, specifically issues with substitution, exclamation marks not found, and curl-config not being found. 

The user also mentioned that there's another bug report linked (bug #636315) where it was noted that "sh" is hard-coded in the script. They're suggesting modifying the script to accept a $SHELL argument so they can use bash or another shell during configure and make steps.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue here isn't related to any of the specific components like networking or graphics. The problem arises during the build process, specifically when running the configure script. The errors indicate problems with how the shell is handling certain commands and substitutions. The user is pointing out that the script uses a hard-coded shell (probably /bin/sh) which might not be available or suitable on their system (Solaris 10). 

This seems to be an issue related to how the build scripts are written, specifically in how they invoke the shell. It's not about translations between architectures or assembly code. Instead, it's about the environment setup during compilationâ€”specifically, ensuring that the correct shell is used. Since the problem isn't directly tied to any of the listed specific categories like KVM or network, but rather to the build process and shell configuration, "other" seems like the most fitting category.

The bug report discusses issues encountered while building QEMU on Solaris 10 due to problems in the configure script. The errors suggest issues with shell substitutions and missing commands. The user refers to a known issue where "sh" is hard-coded, making it difficult to use another shell like bash. This problem isn't related to specific components like networking or graphics but pertains to build process configuration and shell usage.
