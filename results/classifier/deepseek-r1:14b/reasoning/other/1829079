Okay, so the user is having trouble building a static version of QEMU on ARM using Raspbian. They mentioned they're using systemd-nspawn with QEMU 4.0.0 and provided some pastebin links for their compiling process and setup.

Looking at the issue, the build fails because it can't find lp11-kit. The user tried symlinking the library files from the arm-linux-gnueabihf directory to the main lib directory. They also asked if they should symlink other p11 libraries and mentioned they've installed all required packages.

The error seems related to missing dependencies during compilation, specifically with the p11-kit libraries. This is likely a linking issue rather than a semantic mapping problem, so it doesn't fall under 'mistranslation' or 'assembly'. It's more about build-time dependencies, which would be categorized under something like 'other' since it's not one of the specific categories listed like device, graphic, network, etc.

I should categorize this as 'other' because it's a dependency issue during compilation rather than an issue with the runtime behavior or specific components like KVM or VNC.

The bug report is about a build failure when trying to compile QEMU on ARM (Raspbian) due to missing dependencies, specifically related to lp11-kit libraries. This doesn't fall under any of the specified categories except for 'other', as it's not directly tied to a specific component or feature but rather an issue with the build process and dependencies.

**category: other**
