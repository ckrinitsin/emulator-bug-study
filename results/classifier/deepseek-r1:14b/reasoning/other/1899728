Okay, let's see what this bug report is about. The user built QEMU 5.1.0 from source on CentOS 8 using specific commands. They configured it with x86_64 targets and then made and installed it. But when they tried to run 'man qemu-system-x86_64', they got a message saying the manual entry wasn't found.

So, the user is asking why the man page isn't showing up after installation. I need to figure out which category this falls into from the given list.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about a missing man entry after building and installing QEMU. It's not related to any of the specific categories like device or network. The problem is more about how the build process didn't include or install the documentation properly.

In QEMU, when you run 'make install', it should handle the installation of binaries and man pages. If the man entry isn't found, it might mean that either the man page wasn't built during the make process or it wasn't installed correctly. This doesn't directly relate to translation issues (mistranslation) because the problem is post-installation.

So, this seems like an issue with how the build system handles the installation of documentation. Since none of the specific categories fit exactly, the best category here would be 'other'.

The bug report mentions that after successfully building and installing QEMU from source on CentOS 8, the user cannot find the man entry for `qemu-system-x86_64`. This suggests an issue with the build process not correctly installing the documentation or man pages. Since this doesn't directly relate to any specific category like device or network but rather the installation and documentation setup, it falls under 'other'.

**Answer: other**
