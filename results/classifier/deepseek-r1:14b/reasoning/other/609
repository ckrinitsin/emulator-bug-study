Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report says "Can't build system emulation with static on qemu 6.1". Hmm, building system emulation usually relates to how QEMU emulates hardware or creates virtual machines. The term "static" here might refer to linking against a static library or something related to the build process rather than runtime behavior.

Looking at the possible categories, none of them directly mention build issues or compilation problems. Mistranslation is about incorrect mapping in the code, assembly lowering is about converting code to assembly, but that's more about execution than building.

Device would relate to hardware devices being emulated, but this seems more about the build setup. Graphic relates to display issues, socket and network are about connectivity, KVM is about kernel-based virtualization, which QEMU supports but not sure if related here.

Boot could be involved in starting a VM, VNC is remote desktop access, debug is for debugging tools, files might relate to file handling, permissions to access rights, performance to speed issues, kernel about the OS part of QEMU, peripherals to input/output devices, hypervisor about the virtualization layer.

Since the problem is about building with static on a specific version, it doesn't fit into these categories. So maybe "other" is the most appropriate since it's not clearly fitting any specific category provided.

The bug report concerns an issue with building QEMU 6.1 when using static linking, which isn't explicitly listed among the provided categories. Since none of the specified categories (like device, network, etc.) relate to build processes or compilation issues, "other" is the most fitting.

**Answer:** other
