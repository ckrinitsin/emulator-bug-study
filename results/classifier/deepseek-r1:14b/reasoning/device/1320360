Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user mentioned that USB passthrough isn't working anymore after updating from QEMU 1.6.2 to 2.0.0. They get an error message saying "'usb-host' is not a valid device model name" when trying to start the guest.

First, I need to understand what each category means. The possible categories are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The error message points towards a problem with the 'usb-host' device model. USB passthrough typically involves devices like usb-host or similar in QEMU configurations. The fact that it worked before but stopped after an update suggests there might be changes in how QEMU handles USB devices now.

Looking at the categories, 'device' seems relevant because it's about a specific hardware device (USB) not being recognized correctly. Alternatively, 'peripherals' could also fit since USB is a peripheral device. However, 'device' is more general and likely the better fit here as the error is about an invalid device model name.

I don't think it's related to assembly or mistranslation because the issue is with device recognition rather than code translation errors. It's not performance-related either; it's a functional failure. So, 'device' seems appropriate.

The bug report involves USB passthrough failing after updating QEMU, specifically an error about an invalid device model name. Since this pertains to how devices are handled in the system, the category is:

**device**
