Alright, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user mentioned that when a software reset happens, the MSR register isn't being set correctly. They believe it should be reset to zero, but currently, it's left at 0x80, which indicates the controller is ready for a write. However, during reset, it shouldn't be in a state where it's expecting a write.

Looking at the code snippet provided, line 899 of fdc.c deals with resetting the FD controller. The current logic checks if the value doesn't have the FD_DOR_nRESET bit set and then resets the MSR to 0x00. But according to the user, this isn't sufficient because the hardware they've worked with resets the MSR entirely during a reset.

I need to categorize this bug into one of the given options: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

The issue is about how the FDC (Floppy Disk Controller) behaves during a reset. The MSR isn't being correctly reset to zero as expected by hardware behavior. Since this relates to hardware emulation in QEMU, particularly the floppy disk controller's behavior, it falls under the 'device' category because it's about emulating hardware correctly.
