Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "Corsair iCUE Install Fails, qemu VM Reboots". Let me think through this step by step.

First, the issue involves a Corsair iCUE installation failing and causing the QEMU VM to reboot. Corsair iCUE is a software suite for controlling RGB lighting on Corsair peripherals, like keyboards or mice. So, it's likely related to how the VM interacts with hardware or devices.

QEMU is an emulator and virtualization tool, so this issue probably arises within a virtual machine environment. The problem seems to be that when trying to install iCUE, the VM reboots, which might indicate instability or driver issues.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, network, KVM, etc. Since iCUE typically interacts with peripherals (like USB devices), and the VM rebooting suggests a hardware-related issue in the virtual environment, "device" seems fitting. It could be related to how QEMU handles USB or other device drivers during installation.

I don't see any mention of graphics issues, so graphic is out. Network might not be directly involved here unless iCUE uses network drivers, which it usually doesn't. The problem isn't about hypervisor stability but more about a specific device interaction leading to reboot.
