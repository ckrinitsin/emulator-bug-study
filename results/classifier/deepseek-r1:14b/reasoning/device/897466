Alright, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user mentioned that when running QEMU with the '-usb' option, the UHCI Host Controller isn't showing up anymore. In earlier versions like Oneiric and before, it did show up, so something changed between those versions.

First, I need to understand what UHCI is. UHCI stands for Universal Host Controller Interface, which is part of the USB standard. So, in this context, QEMU is supposed to emulate USB devices for the virtual machine.

The bug report shows that when using 'info usbhost' in the monitor, it's not listing the UHCI Host Controller anymore. That suggests that either the USB emulation isn't working correctly or the way it reports devices has changed.

Looking at the command-line arguments, the user is specifying '-usb', which enables USB support in QEMU. So, if the host controller isn't showing up, maybe there's an issue with how QEMU initializes the USB devices or interacts with the host system's USB subsystem.

The user also mentioned that this might be a regression between versions, possibly related to the 3.2 kernel or a newer version of QEMU (like 0.14.1 vs 0.15). That makes me think it could be an issue in how QEMU interacts with the host's USB drivers or the way it's being configured.

Now, looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. The UHCI Host Controller is related to USB devices, which falls under 'peripherals'. So, this bug seems to be about a peripheral device not being recognized or emulated properly in QEMU.

Another angle: the 'info usbhost' command isn't returning the expected device information. This could relate to how QEMU interacts with the host's USB subsystem (kernel), but since it's about reporting devices rather than functionality, it might still fall under peripherals. Alternatively, if the issue is with the kernel module or driver, it would be 'kernel', but the primary problem seems to be with the presence of the host controller in QEMU.

So, considering all this, I think the category is 'peripherals' because it's related to USB device emulation, which is a peripheral feature in QEMU.
