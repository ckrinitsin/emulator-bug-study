Alright, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user is having trouble with virtiofsd and IVSHMEM in QEMU. From the description, they're trying to share a folder using ivshmem-plain but it doesn't work. However, when they use a NUMA node setup, it works fine.

Looking at the logs, virtiofsd errors out because of a MissingMemoryMapping issue. The QEMU logs mention failures in vhost operations, specifically invalid arguments and issues with setting message fds. 

Hmm, IVSHMEM is related to shared memory between the host and guest, which is part of the device setup. Since the problem arises when using ivshmem-plain but works with NUMA node memdev, it's likely an issue with how the IVSHMEM device is being handled in QEMU. This seems specific to a particular device rather than something like assembly or permissions.

The keywords here are "IVSHMEM device" and "hypervisor" since QEMU acts as a hypervisor when using KVM. The problem is within the virtualization layer, so it's probably under the "device" category but more specifically related to the hypervisor's handling of that device.
