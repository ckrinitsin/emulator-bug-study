Okay, I need to classify this bug report about adding support for MMIO devices in VFIO. Let me break it down.

The user provided some information links: one from the kernel.org mailing list and another from a GitHub repo related to libvfio-user. Also, there's a mention of supporting non-PCI devices in ivshmem, which points to a specific issue in QEMU.

VFIO stands for Virtual Function I/O, which is used for managing virtual devices, especially in KVM. MMIO refers to Memory-Mapped I/O, where device registers are accessed as memory locations. So supporting MMIO devices in VFIO likely involves handling such devices properly within the VFIO framework.

Looking at the categories: hypervisor, kernel, device... Since VFIO is part of how virtualization handles hardware devices, and this report is about adding support for certain types of devices (MMIO), it falls under the 'device' category. It's not about assembly translation or performance issues. The mention of non-PCI devices in ivshmem also relates to device handling.

Therefore, the appropriate category here is 'device'.

The bug report discusses adding support for MMIO devices in VFIO, which relates to managing virtual devices within QEMU. Since this involves handling specific types of devices and their I/O operations, the correct category is:

**device**
