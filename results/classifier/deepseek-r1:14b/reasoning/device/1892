Okay, I need to figure out the category for this bug report in QEMU. The user is getting an error when running qemu-system-aarch64: "Property 'virt-8.2-machine.cxl' not found." They provided a script and mentioned that it happens with both QEMU 8.1 and 8.2.

Looking at the problem, they're using the '-M virt,gic-version=3,cxl=on' option. The error suggests that QEMU doesn't recognize 'cxl' as a valid machine property for this configuration. 

I should consider the categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, etc. Since it's related to a specific machine type (virt) and an option (cxl), which is part of the machine's configuration, I think it falls under 'device'. The 'cxl' likely refers to some device setup, possibly related to CXL devices in QEMU.

The error message indicates that the property isn't found, so it's about how the machine type handles device options. Therefore, the category is probably 'device'.
