Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user provided a detailed bug where using the `-device ide-hd` without specifying the bus causes an error because the bus doesn't have enough units available. 

Looking at the categories given: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is about devices not being assigned correctly to buses. Specifically, when adding multiple IDE HDs without specifying the bus, they all try to use the first available bus, which might already be full. This leads to an error because the bus can't accommodate more units than it supports. 

So, this seems related to how devices are handled in QEMU. The issue is with device assignment and bus management. Since the problem arises from not specifying the bus and causing a conflict, it's definitely a device-related issue.

I don't see any other category that fits better. It's not about graphics or networking specifically; it's more general device handling. So, I think the correct category here is "device."
