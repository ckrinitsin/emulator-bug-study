Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The user is reporting an issue with QEMU where setting `wheel-axis=false` doesn't take effect during hardware initialization. This causes Android to treat the device as a pointer instead of a tablet. They mention that they tried fixing it by changing the default value in the code, but it didn't work as expected when set to false.

Looking at the provided diff, it seems like there's a change in how the `wheel-axis` property is handled. The original line had `true` as the default, and the user changed it to `false`. So the bug might be related to how device properties are being applied during initialization or configuration.

The problem revolves around device-specific settings not being correctly applied at the hardware init stage. Since this involves device configuration parameters for a VirtIO tablet device, it's likely related to device setup in QEMU.

Considering the categories, options like 'device' and 'hardware' seem relevant. However, since this is more about how the property is set during initialization, maybe 'device' or 'boot' could fit. But looking at the list of possible categories provided (which includes 'device', 'graphic', etc.), the most appropriate category would be 'device' because it pertains to device configuration settings not being applied correctly.
