Okay, I'm looking at this bug report where someone is trying to compile QEMU on macOS with vhost-vsock support and it's failing. The errors are about undefined symbols like _vhost_dev_cleanup, _vhost_virtqueue_mask, etc.

I know that vhost-vsock is part of the Virtio subsystem in QEMU, which handles virtualization devices. These undefined symbols suggest that some functions aren't being linked correctly.

Since these functions are related to device initialization and management, it likely falls under the 'device' category because they're dealing with how devices are handled during runtime.

The bug report involves issues with vhost-vsock compilation on macOS, specifically linking errors for vhost-related functions. These functions are part of the Virtio subsystem, which manages virtualization devices. Therefore, the appropriate category is:

**device**
