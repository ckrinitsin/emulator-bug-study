Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. The issue is that when using the rbd block device with QEMU and trying to use the "savevm" command in the monitor, it results in an error: "Error -95 while writing VM". 

First, I need to understand what each category means based on the given options. Let me list them out:

- mistranslation
- assembly
- other
- device
- graphic
- socket
- network
- KVM
- boot
- vnc
- debug
- files
- permissions
- performance
- kernel
- peripherals
- hypervisor

The bug report mentions using ceph rbd as the block device. RBD stands forRADOS Block Device, which is part of Ceph storage. The user is trying to save the VM state using "savevm" in the monitor but gets an error.

I recall that QEMU has support for various devices and storage backends. The issue here seems related to how the block device (RBD) interacts with QEMU's save functionality. Since RBD is a type of block device, it falls under the 'device' category.

The other options don't seem as relevant. For example, 'network' would be more about networking issues, and 'hypervisor' relates to KVM or other hypervisors, but the problem here is with saving the VM state using RBD, which is a block device feature.

So, I think the correct category for this bug report is 'device'.

The issue involves the interaction between QEMU's savevm command and the RBD block device, which falls under the 'device' category. 

Answer: device
