Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "piix crashes on mips when using multiple cpus." The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, I'll break down the bug report. "Piix" is likely referring to PIIX4 or similar chip used in QEMU as a model for IDE controllers. MIPS refers to the CPU architecture being emulated or run on. The issue occurs when using multiple CPUs, so it's related to how QEMU handles multi-CPU configurations.

Looking at the categories: "device" seems relevant because PIIX is part of device emulation, specifically storage controllers. However, another category could be "peripherals," but since PIIX is a controller rather than an explicit peripheral like a GPU or network card, I think "device" might be more precise.

I don't see anything pointing to mistranslation, assembly lowering, or performance issues here. The crash is specific to multi-CPU usage and the device (PIIX), so it's not about booting, networking, graphics, etc.

The bug report involves a crash in the PIIX controller when using multiple CPUs on MIPS architecture. This points to an issue with how QEMU emulates devices, specifically storage controllers, under certain CPU configurations.

**Answer: device**
