Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem again.

The user is trying to install CentOS or Fedora27 on Windows8 using QEMU. They mentioned that their touchpad and USB mouse aren't recognized during the graphical installation. They provided their commands and tried adding -device usb-mouse, but got an error about no 'usb-bus' found.

So the main issue here is with the input devices not being recognized. The user added a device option for the USB mouse but faced an error, which suggests there's a problem with how QEMU is handling the USB bus or devices.

Looking at the categories: device seems to fit because it's related to hardware devices (mouse, touchpad) not functioning correctly in QEMU. Other options like 'graphic' could be considered since it's about the graphical interface, but the core issue is more about device recognition and configuration, which falls under 'device'.

I think the category should be 'device'.
