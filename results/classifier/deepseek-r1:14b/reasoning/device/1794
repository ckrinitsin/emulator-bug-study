Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The bug is about Virtio-GPU not filling the Response data for cursor queue commands in QEMU.

First, looking at the problem description: The user points out that according to the VIRTIO_GPU specification, certain commands like UPDATE_CURSOR and MOVE_CURSOR should have response headers (VIRTIO_GPU_RESP_OK_NODATA). However, in QEMU's implementation, specifically in virtio-gpu.c around line 1136, there's no handling of these responses. The code just fetches the command and executes it without considering the response.

The categories provided include things like 'mistranslation', 'assembly', 'device', etc. I need to determine which category fits best.

The issue is related to Virtio-GPU not properly generating responses for cursor commands. Since this involves how QEMU's Virtio-GPU driver handles device-specific commands and their corresponding responses, it seems to fall under the 'device' category. The problem isn't about translation or assembly; it's specifically about how the device (Virtio-GPU) interacts with the host through its command handling.

So, the correct classification should be 'device'.

The bug is related to the Virtio-GPU not generating responses for specific commands as per the specification. This directly affects the functionality of the GPU device in QEMU. Therefore, it falls under the 'device' category.
