Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The user provided two lines: "Add iphone emulated device" and "Additional information:". So the main issue here is about adding an iPhone as an emulated device.

Looking at the categories, there's 'device' which seems relevant because it's about hardware emulation. Other categories like 'graphic', 'network', or 'hypervisor' don't fit as well here. The request isn't about performance, permissions, or any other listed areas.

Therefore, the correct category is 'device'.
