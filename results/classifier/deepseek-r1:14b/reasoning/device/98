Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "Curses Keyboard Broken On OS X". The possible categories are things like mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, let's break down the bug report. It mentions "Curses Keyboard" which is a terminal-based text editor that uses the curses library for handling input and output. The issue is that it's broken on OS X. So, probably related to how the keyboard input is handled in this environment.

Since Curses relies heavily on terminal and keyboard input/output, any issues here would be related to device drivers or the way the system handles hardware inputs. On OS X, the handling of keyboards might involve specific device interactions, possibly through ioctl calls or other low-level operations. 

Looking at the categories, "device" seems appropriate because it's about a hardware component (the keyboard) not working correctly in a software context. Alternatively, "peripherals" could also fit, but since the keyboard is part of the input devices and often handled by device drivers, "device" might be more precise.

Other possibilities: Could it relate to graphics? Not really, unless there's an issue with display output affecting keyboard input, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Network? Probably not. It's about the keyboard, a physical device connected to the system.

So considering all this, the category is likely "device".
