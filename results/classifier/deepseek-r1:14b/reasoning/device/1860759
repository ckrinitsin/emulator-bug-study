Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. So, the user is reporting that after upgrading QEMU from 3.1.0 to 4.2.0, the `-snapshot` option isn't being respected when using blockdev with libvirt. They noticed that their disk images are getting modified, which shouldn't happen if snapshot mode is enabled.

First, I need to understand what the `-snapshot` option does in QEMU. From what I remember, enabling snapshots makes QEMU use a copy-on-write approach for the virtual disks, so any changes made during the VM's operation don't affect the original image. This is useful for testing or temporary work without worrying about data loss.

The user provided two test cases: one using `-hda` which works fine and keeps the image unmodified, and another using blockdev which doesn't respect the snapshot option. The issue seems to be specific to how QEMU handles the block device configuration when using libvirt, particularly with the blockdev parameters passed through the command line.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. I need to pick one that best fits this bug.

The problem is related to how block devices are being handled, specifically when using the `-snapshot` option with blockdev. It doesn't seem like an assembly or translation issue because it's about device configuration rather than code generation. It's also not a graphic or network-related problem. KVM is involved since QEMU uses KVM for virtualization, but the bug isn't directly about hypervisor functionality.

The `-snapshot` option affects how block devices are used. So, this might fall under 'device' category because it's related to the handling of block devices and their configurations. Alternatively, considering that blockdev is a storage-related feature, 'files' or 'permissions' could be possibilities, but those seem less likely as the issue isn't about file access rights or permissions.

Another angle: since the problem arises when using blockdev with libvirt, it's possible that there's an issue in how QEMU parses or applies the block device parameters when snapshots are enabled. This might point towards a 'mistranslation' if the options aren't correctly interpreted from the source (libvirt configuration) to the target (QEMU process). However, 'mistranslation' is more about incorrect semantic mapping between architectures, which doesn't quite fit here.

Wait, maybe 'blockdev' isn't one of the categories. The closest would be 'device' since it's related to how devices are handled in QEMU. Alternatively, perhaps it's a configuration issue with block devices not respecting certain flags, but I'm not sure if that maps directly to any category provided.

Looking back at the options: 'blockdev' isn't listed, so I have to choose from the given categories. The bug report mentions that using `-hda` works, implying that it's an option parsing issue when block devices are defined via blockdev. It might be a problem in how QEMU processes command-line arguments or configurations for block devices when snapshots are enabled.

Considering all this, I think 'device' is the most appropriate category because it relates to how QEMU handles device configurations and their associated options like snapshotting.

The bug report describes an issue where the `-snapshot` option isn't respected when using blockdev with libvirt. This suggests a problem in how block devices are configured or processed, likely within the device handling part of QEMU.
