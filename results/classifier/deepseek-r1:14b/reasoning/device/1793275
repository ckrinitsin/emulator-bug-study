Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. Let's read through the details.

The user upgraded from QEMU 2.x to 3.0 and now their guests aren't starting. For FreeBSD guests, they're getting "unexpected cache type 4" errors, which seems like an internal message not found elsewhere. The Archlinux guest stops at "uncompressing initial ramdisk."

Looking at the command lines, both use Virtio devices and VDE networking with KVM enabled.

The categories include things like mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, network, hypervisor, etc.

Since the issue is after an update, it's likely a change in how QEMU handles certain features. The FreeBSD error might be related to caching or block devices, possibly a regression in Virtio drivers or the way cache modes are handled. Similarly, the Archlinux guest failing at ramdisk uncompression could also relate to storage device handling.

Considering that both guests use Virtio for their drives and network, it's possible this is a problem with how QEMU 3.0 handles these devices. Alternatively, it might be related to KVM or hypervisor initialization changes.

The error messages suggest issues during the guest boot process, which points towards hardware device emulation problems. So, 'device' seems like a fitting category because it likely relates to Virtio block or network devices not being initialized correctly.
