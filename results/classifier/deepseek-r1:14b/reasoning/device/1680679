Alright, let me try to figure out how to categorize this bug report. The user is having trouble running QEMU twice when using GPU passthrough with Windows 7. After the first run and a proper shutdown of Windows, they can't boot it again unless they reboot their Linux system. They suspect that rerunning `vfiobind` might be causing issues.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and other.

The problem seems related to how QEMU handles GPU passthrough, specifically with VFIO bindings. The user is using a script that binds the GPU each time they run QEMU. If running `vfiobind` again causes problems, it might be due to leftover resources or improper unbinding after the first session. This sounds like a device management issue because it's about how devices are handled and rebound.

So, considering the categories, 'device' seems appropriate as the issue revolves around handling of hardware devices (GPU) by QEMU when exiting and trying to restart.

The bug report involves issues with GPU passthrough and QEMU not allowing a second boot without a system reboot. The problem is likely related to how devices are handled after the first session, pointing towards device management as the category.
