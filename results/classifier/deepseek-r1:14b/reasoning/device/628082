Okay, so I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. The issue mentioned is about the nl-be keymap not working correctly. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the user reports that the number keys and some other vital keys aren't functioning as expected with the current nl-be keymap in KVM. They mention that there's a correct version available but it's not being used. This seems related to input handling within the virtual machine environment.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. Since this is about keyboard mapping and how keys are interpreted, it's likely tied to the input devices in KVM. The keymap issue would affect how peripherals (like the keyboard) interact with the VM.

So, considering all that, the most appropriate category seems to be "device" because it involves hardware device emulation, specifically the keyboard's behavior within a virtualized environment.

The bug report pertains to incorrect keyboard mapping in KVM, which affects input devices. Therefore, the category is:

**device**
