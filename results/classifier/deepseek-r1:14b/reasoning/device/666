Okay, let's figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned that "ivshmem-plain cannot be used on non-Linux hosts." So the issue is with ivshmem-plain not working on systems that aren't Linux.

Looking at the possible categories: I know ivshmem is related to shared memory for device communication in QEMU, which often involves device drivers and hardware interaction. The user also provided a patch that disables doorbell support on non-Linux builds. Doorbells are part of the interrupt mechanism used by devices, so this seems device-related.

Other categories like 'network' or 'vnc' don't fit here because it's not about networking or display protocols. It's more about how the device interacts with the host, especially when running on non-Linux systems. So the most appropriate category is 'device'.
