Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let's read through it carefully.

The user is reporting an issue with QEMU-KVM where using -usbdevice tablet doesn't work on a Windows XP client. They mention that in prior versions, it worked fine but now there's no mouse at all. The problem seems specific to the USB device setup for the tablet, which affects input handling.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. Since this is about a USB device (tablet) not functioning as expected, "device" seems like the most fitting category. It's related to hardware devices being properly recognized and configured in the virtual machine.

I don't think it's under "graphic" because that would relate more to display issues, which isn't the case here. Similarly, other categories like network or socket don't apply. The issue is clearly with the USB device functionality.
