Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is reporting an issue where the Ubuntu 18 cloud image isn't booting on an OpenStack instance. They mention that the Nova flow works fine, but when accessing the console, the boot process gets stuck waiting for device dev-vdb.device. There are dependency failures related to /mnt and the filesystem check on /dev/vdb. Also, the system receives an IP but doesn't get configured properly since Ubuntu 18 introduced Netplan.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem seems to be related to the boot process getting stuck due to issues with devices and filesystem checks. The error mentions waiting for dev-vdb.device and problems with /mnt and file system checks. This suggests a hardware or device-related issue during booting.

Netplan is mentioned as part of the network configuration, but the primary issue appears to be in the boot sequence not properly initializing devices. Since the Nova flow works, it's likely an issue within QEMU/KVM handling the virtual devices rather than OpenStack itself.

The error messages point towards device dependencies failing, which falls under the 'device' category. It's about how the system is recognizing or initializing the virtual block devices during boot.
