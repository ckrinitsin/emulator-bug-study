Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The commit mentioned is about postponing the execution of event_notifier_cleanup in virtio, which causes crashes in vhost-user devices like vhost-user-scsi/blk and vhost-vsocks when exiting the host driver. 

First, let me understand what each category means. "Device" relates to hardware device issues within QEMU, such as emulated or VirtIO devices. Since the problem is with vhost-user devices crashing, it's likely a device-related issue.

Looking at other categories: Mistranslation and assembly are more about code translation or lowering, which doesn't fit here. Graphic, network, socket, KVM, VNC, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisorâ€”none of these seem to directly relate to the device crash caused by this commit.

The issue is specifically with VirtIO devices (vhost-user-scsi, vhost-vsocks), which are handled under QEMU's device management. So the category should be "device."
