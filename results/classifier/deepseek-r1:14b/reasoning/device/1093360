Okay, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is having trouble with files on Microsoft ISO images when mounted in a QEMU VM. Specifically, the version info gets stripped, causing installation failures like Microsoft UAG not installing correctly.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about files losing version information. That seems related to how QEMU handles file systems or storage devices within the VM. The problem occurs when mounting an ISO image, which involves device emulation, specifically emulating IDE or SCSI controllers and CD/DVD drives.

So it's likely under 'device' because it relates to how QEMU emulates hardware devices, particularly storage devices, leading to incorrect handling of files within them.
