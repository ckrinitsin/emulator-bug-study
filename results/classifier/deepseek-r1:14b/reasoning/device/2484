Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "Confusing query-gic-capabilities output in --without-default-devices config". Let's break it down step by step.

First, the title mentions "query-gic-capabilities output." I know that GIC stands for Generic Interrupt Controller, which is related to virtualization and handling interrupts in QEMU. So this likely involves device or hardware emulation.

Next, the bug occurs when using "--without-default-devices" configuration. This option probably disables some default devices, meaning the setup might not include standard hardware configurations. The output of query-gic-capabilities seems confusing under these circumstances.

Looking at the categories: device makes sense because GIC is part of the hardware devices being emulated. Other options like 'network' or 'graphic' don't fit here since it's about interrupt controllers, which are more low-level hardware components. Hypervisor could be related, but the issue is with device configuration output rather than hypervisor functions themselves.

So, considering all this, the most appropriate category for this bug report is 'device'.

The bug relates to the output of query-gic-capabilities when default devices are disabled, which pertains to hardware emulation. 

Answer: device
