Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. Let me read through the problem and understand what's happening.

The user reports that when they use device_del and drive_del commands in QEMU, the virtio SCSI disk isn't being detached as expected. After rebooting the instance and then detaching, the disk remains attached even after waiting several minutes.

Looking at the steps to reproduce: They run the instance, attach the disk, reboot, and then issue the del commands. The expected result is that the disk should be detached, but it's still present in the domain info.

The provided QEMU process details show that the virtio-blk-pci device is being used with a specific drive configuration. So, the issue is related to how QEMU handles device and drive deletion, particularly for SCSI disks over virtio.

I need to categorize this. The options are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem is about devices not being properly detached after deletion commands. Since it's related to how QEMU handles device removal and the virtio SCSI disk isn't unplugged correctly, this falls under the 'device' category.
