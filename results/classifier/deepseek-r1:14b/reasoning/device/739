Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is having an issue with QEMU where the `-snapshot` option isn't working when using `-blockdev`. When they run the guest with these options, changes are being written directly to the disk image instead of temporary files. 

First, I need to understand what each part does. The `-snapshot` option in QEMU is supposed to make changes only to a temporary copy, not the original image. This is useful for testing without affecting the base image.

The user mentioned that when they use `-blockdev`, the snapshot doesn't work, but switching to the legacy `-drive` option makes it work. That suggests there's an issue with how the block device is being configured when using `-blockdev`.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The problem seems related to how block devices are handled. The user is using `-blockdev`, which is a newer way of configuring block devices in QEMU, and it's not respecting the snapshot option correctly. This points towards an issue with the device configuration or perhaps how the snapshot feature interacts with the blockdev setup.

Mistranslation might refer to incorrect mapping from source to target architecture, but this doesn't seem related here. It's more about block device handling. The `-snapshot` works when using `-drive`, so it's likely a problem specific to how `-blockdev` is processed.

Considering the categories, "device" seems appropriate because it's directly related to block devices and their configuration in QEMU. Alternatively, it could be under "files" if it's about file handling during snapshots, but I think "device" is more precise here.

The issue relates to how block devices are configured with `-blockdev` not respecting the snapshot option correctly. This points to a problem in device configuration.
