Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user is having trouble disabling the default floppy drive in QEMU 6.0. They mentioned that there was a change where you can't configure floppy controller device properties with -global anymore. Previously, they could use something like `-global isa-fdc.driveA=` to remove the default floppy drive, but now it's not working.

They tried using `-device floppy,unit=0,drive=`, expecting it to disable the floppy drive, but it didn't work. They also mentioned that using `-nodefaults` disables all default devices, which isn't what they want because they need other default devices except the floppy.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The issue seems to be related to how QEMU handles hardware devices. Specifically, the user is trying to configure or remove a device (the floppy drive) but isn't able to do so with the new options. This sounds like a problem with device configuration rather than something related to translation, assembly, or other categories.

So, I think the appropriate category here would be "device" because it's about configuring or removing a hardware device in QEMU.

The bug report deals with issues in configuring or disabling a hardware device (floppy drive) in QEMU. The user is facing problems using the `-device` option to remove the floppy drive, indicating an issue related to device configuration.
