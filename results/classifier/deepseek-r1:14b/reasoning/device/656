Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user is having trouble with QEMU not recognizing the SD card on the sabrelite board. They built QEMU and U-boot correctly and can start the image, but they can't interact with tmp.img. They tried different options (-driver vs -blockdev) without success.

Looking at the categories, this seems related to block devices because the issue is about interacting with an SD card image. The problem isn't with translation or assembly; it's more about device recognition and storage handling. So 'device' would be the appropriate category here.

The bug report is about QEMU not recognizing the SD card on the sabrelite board, which falls under block devices.
