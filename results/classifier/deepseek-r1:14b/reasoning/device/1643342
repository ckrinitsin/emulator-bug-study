Alright, let's tackle this bug report classification step by step. The user is having trouble with QEMU after upgrading from version 2.6.2 to 2.7.9. They can't boot their VM anymore because of an error when adding USB devices.

The error message they're getting is: "qemu-system-x86_64: -usbdevice host:046d:c227: could not add USB device 'host:046d:c227'". This happens with every USB device they've tried. However, it worked fine in version 2.6.2.

Looking at their script, they're using the `-usb` option and specifying several USB devices via `-usbdevice`. They also have other devices like VFIO-pci for graphics and Virtio-scsi, but those seem to be working as the VM isn't booting due to USB issues.

The possible categories include things like 'mistranslation', 'assembly', 'other', 'device', etc. The error is specifically about adding a USB device failing. USB devices are handled under QEMU's device management, particularly when using KVM or similar virtualization features.

Since the issue is with USB passthrough and it worked before in an older version, it might be related to changes in how QEMU handles USB devices in 2.7.x. This could fall under a broader category rather than something specific like 'assembly' or 'graphic'. The most fitting category from the list provided is 'device' because it's directly related to adding and managing USB devices in QEMU.

The bug report involves issues with USB device passthrough after updating QEMU, which falls under the 'device' category.

device
