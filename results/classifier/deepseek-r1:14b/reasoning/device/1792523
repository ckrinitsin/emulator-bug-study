Alright, I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user mentioned that USB passthrough devices aren't resetting on the host after VM shutdown when using the -daemonize option. Without it, everything works fine. 

Looking at the possible categories: device seems relevant because it's about USB devices not functioning correctly after the VM shuts down. Other categories like network or graphics don't fit here since the issue is with USB peripherals.

I think the main problem lies in how QEMU handles device resources when running as a daemonized process, possibly leading to improper cleanup upon shutdown. This relates more to hardware device management rather than translation issues or performance.
