Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the provided categories. The bug report mentions an error when starting a domain in QEMU-KVM. Specifically, it says "could not open disk image" because the file doesn't exist. 

Looking at the error message, the problem seems related to accessing a disk image that's supposed to be there but isn't. The backing file is empty, which might cause other instances to fail as well. This points towards an issue with how disk images are being handled or accessed.

The categories provided include things like device, network, hypervisor, etc. Since the error is about not finding a disk image, it's likely related to storage devices and their handling within the system. Therefore, the most appropriate category here would be 'device'.
