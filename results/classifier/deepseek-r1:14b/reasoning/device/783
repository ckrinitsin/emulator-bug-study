Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. The user provided the bug report as "risc-v: provide CPU without MMU". Let me break this down.

First, RISC-V is an instruction set architecture. In QEMU, it's likely part of the machine or device emulation. The issue here is that the CPU is being provided without an MMU (Memory Management Unit). 

MMU is a hardware component responsible for translating virtual addresses to physical addresses and managing memory protection. If the CPU lacks an MMU, this affects how the system handles memory, which could impact the overall performance or stability of the emulated system.

Looking at the possible categories: device seems relevant because it's about a specific hardware component (CPU with MMU). Alternatively, it might be related to kernel issues if the MMU is part of the OS interaction. But since the bug report is about providing the CPU without an MMU in QEMU, which emulates devices and peripherals, I think 'device' fits best.

Other categories like network or hypervisor don't seem directly applicable here. It's not a translation issue (mistranslation) because that would relate to code mapping. Also, it's not about performance per se, but rather the functionality of the device.
