Okay, so I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem is that when using the vsock device in QEMU, there's an error message: "vhost_set_features failed: Operation not supported (95)". This happens immediately after the guest initializes, and connecting to the guest via vsock isn't possible. The user provided steps to reproduce, which include cloning a repository, building an image, and running QEMU with specific options, including setting `queue_reset=true`.

The additional information mentions that the problem goes away when `queue_reset=false`. It also notes that this behavior started after commit 69e1c14aa222, which introduced support for vq reset feature negotiation. The issue occurs both with and without KVM.

Looking at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The error is related to vsock and vhost_set_features. VSOCK is part of VirtIO devices, which are handled by the vhost or hypervisor in QEMU. The problem occurs when queue_reset is enabled, which suggests it's an issue with how VirtIO queues are being managed, possibly a regression introduced by a recent change.

Since the error message mentions "vhost_set_features" and relates to VirtIO devices, this seems to be a device-related issue. It might involve how QEMU handles the vsock device under certain configurations. The fact that it's specific to a feature negotiation commit points towards a problem in how features are being set or negotiated for the vsock device.

So, considering all this, the most fitting category is "device". This refers to issues with the VirtIO devices or their configuration within QEMU.

The bug report involves an error related to the vsock device and feature negotiation. It's a specific issue with how the vsock device is handled when `queue_reset` is enabled. The problem is linked to VirtIO functionality, which falls under the "device" category.
