Okay, so I've got a bug report to classify for QEMU. The issue is that when using ppc64 and virtio-scsi, only the first SCSI disk shows up in the guest. Let me break this down step by step.

First, understanding the components involved: ppc64 refers to PowerPC 64-bit architecture, which is a specific target for QEMU. Virtio-scsi is part of the VirtIO family, which provides paravirtualized device drivers for I/O operations. It's commonly used in virtual machines to provide high-performance block devices.

The problem here is that when two virtio-scsi targets are added to a single guest, only the first disk is visible. So, the enumeration process isn't picking up all the disks as expected. The user mentions they've tried with a specific Linux kernel version and also used QEMU from git, but the issue persists.

Looking at the possible categories: assembly, device, graphic, network, KVM, etc. I need to figure out which one fits best.

The issue is related to how devices are being handled in the guest OS. Since it's about SCSI disks not showing up when multiple targets are added, this seems like a problem with the device enumeration process or perhaps the way VirtIO-scsi devices are exposed to the guest.

Virtio-scsi uses a special approach where each physical disk is mapped as a separate target. If only one target shows up, it could be a misconfiguration in how these targets are being added or recognized by QEMU. Alternatively, there might be an issue with how the guest's SCSI subsystem is handling multiple VirtIO devices.

I'm leaning towards 'device' because it's about hardware device recognition within the virtual machine. The problem isn't related to translation issues (mistranslation) since that would likely affect more aspects or cause other errors. It's also not a performance issue, nor does it seem to be directly related to networking, graphics, or sockets.

So, considering all this, the most fitting category is 'device'.

The bug report describes an issue where only the first SCSI disk appears when multiple virtio-scsi targets are added. This pertains to device recognition and enumeration within the guest OS, which falls under the 'device' category.
