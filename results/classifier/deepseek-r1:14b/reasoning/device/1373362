Alright, I'm looking at this bug report where the user is trying to compile QEMU 2.1.1 on Gentoo/x86 and encountering a compilation error. The error message points to an undeclared identifier 'q35_dsdt_applesmc_sta' in the file acpi-build.c at line 119.

First, I need to understand what's causing this error. The user included some steps from their build process. It looks like QEMU is trying to generate a DSDT (Differentiated System Description Table) for ACPI, which is part of setting up the hardware description for emulated systems.

The error occurs during the compilation of acpi-build.o when it references q35_dsdt_applesmc_sta but can't find its declaration. This suggests that either the variable isn't defined in the code or there's an issue with how it's being included or generated.

Looking at the user's search results, they tried to find where 'q35_dsdt_applesmc_sta' is declared by searching the source files. The results show that this identifier appears in several DSDT files (like q35-acpi-dsdt.dsl.i and its orig versions) but isn't found in acpi-build.c or elsewhere. This indicates that the variable might not be properly included when building the project.

Since QEMU is an emulator, it relies heavily on accurate hardware description tables like the DSDT for correct device emulation. If this variable isn't declared, it could mean that a necessary part of the DSDT setup is missing or incorrectly generated.

The error is occurring during the compilation process, which falls under build-time issues. The problem doesn't seem to be related to user-mode translation errors (mistranslation), assembly lowering, or performance issues. It's more about missing declarations and incorrect file generation, which points towards a problem in how the DSDT is being built.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. The most relevant category here seems to be 'device' because the issue relates to hardware description (DSDT), which is part of device emulation in QEMU.

Therefore, the appropriate classification for this bug report is 'device'.
