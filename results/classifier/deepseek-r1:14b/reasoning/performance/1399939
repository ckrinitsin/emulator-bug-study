Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read it carefully.

The user is talking about building QEMU with "-faltivec" and "-maltivec". They want support added so that these flags can be included in CPPFLAGS during the build process. Their goal is to make emulation faster on PPC machines.

Looking at the possible categories, I see options like 'performance', which seems relevant here because they're talking about making something faster. Other categories include things like network, graphic, etc., but those don't seem to fit as much.

They mentioned using compiler flags for optimization (-faltivec and -maltivec), which are related to how code is compiled. This isn't about device emulation or user-mode assembly specifically, but rather about the build process affecting performance.

So I think 'performance' is the right category because they're optimizing the build for better speed in emulation.

The bug report focuses on adding specific compiler flags (-faltivec and -maltivec) to improve QEMU's performance on PPC machines. This relates directly to enhancing performance during compilation and execution, making 'performance' the appropriate category.

**Answer:** performance
