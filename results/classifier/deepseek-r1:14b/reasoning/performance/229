Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report says: "build-tools-and-docs-debian job waste cycles building pointless things." 

First, I notice that it's about the build process. The term "waste cycles" refers to unnecessary computation or resources being used. So this is related to how efficient the build job is running.

Looking at the categories, "performance" seems relevant because it's about optimizing resource usage during builds. None of the other categories directly relate to the efficiency or optimization of build processes. It's not a translation issue (mistranslation), nor does it pertain to assembly lowering (assembly). 

The mention of "job waste cycles" points towards performance issues, so I'll categorize this under "performance."
