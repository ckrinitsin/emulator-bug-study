Okay, so I need to figure out how to classify this bug report regarding QEMU's startup time when using the static build of qemu-user-static from version 2.8 to 2.11. The user mentioned that with the static 2.11 build, running a command takes several seconds instead of just a fraction of a second. 

The problem seems to be in the `init_guest_space()` function within elfload.c. This function is responsible for mapping parts of the address space. It's trying to find an appropriate base address by using mmap. In static builds, without PIE (and thus ASLR), the text segment is fixed at 0x60000000. 

The issue arises because when `guest_size` increased from 0xf7000000 to 0xffff0000 in QEMU 2.11, the initial mmap attempts for this larger size often collide with existing memory mappings. This forces the code to fall back to a brute-force search for an acceptable base, which takes many iterations and significantly slows down startup.

So, why is this happening? The static build disables ASLR, so memory regions are predictable. With the bigger `guest_size`, the initial mmap tends to land near another mapped region. This wasn't as much of a problem with smaller sizes because there was more space available before the text segment.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

The bug is related to how memory is being mapped and managed during QEMU's startup. It's affecting performance because the initialization takes too long due to excessive mmap calls. This doesn't seem to be a mistranslation or assembly issue. The problem isn't directly with devices, graphics, sockets, network, KVM, etc., but rather with how memory is allocated in user-mode.

The key point is that the issue arises from changes in guest_size and ASLR being disabled. It's causing performance degradation because of the inefficient mmap strategy. So, it falls under the 'performance' category since the primary effect is on startup time due to memory management inefficiency.
