Okay, so I have this bug report where QEMU in TCG mode fails to boot a Linux kernel, specifically Cirros and CentOS images. The user is using QEMU 2.6.0 with libvirt 2.0.0. The VM gets stuck at "Starting up..." and doesn't proceed.

First, I need to figure out what category this bug falls into from the given list: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, or other.

The issue is about the VM not booting correctly. The key here is that it's failing in TCG mode, which stands for Translation Coupled Guest. TCG is part of QEMU's approach to just-in-time (JIT) compilation where instructions are translated on the fly. If the translation process isn't working right, it could cause the VM to fail booting.

Looking at the possible categories:

- **Mistranslation**: This refers to incorrect mapping from source architecture to IR or target, which is user-mode assembly lowering. It seems relevant because if TCG is having issues translating instructions, that's a mistranslation problem.
  
Other options like device, graphic, network, etc., might be involved in other failures but the core issue here is the boot process not completing due to translation issues.

The error occurs during the boot of the VM, so it's related to how QEMU handles the guest code. Since TCG mode is about translating the guest instructions, any failure in that step would point towards mistranslation.
