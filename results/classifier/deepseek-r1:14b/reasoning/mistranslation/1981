Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user mentioned that in QEMU's riscv.c file, there's a confusion between pmpaddr13 and pmpaddr14 CSRs. Looking at the code snippet provided, lines 2119 and 2120 have incorrect case mappings. 

This issue is about mapping the correct addresses to their respective CSR names. Since this relates to how user-mode assembly is handled in QEMU, specifically during disassembly or translation, it falls under 'mistranslation'. The problem isn't with device drivers, graphics, sockets, or network issues; it's purely a semantic mapping error in the source to target code.

So, the correct category here should be 'mistranslation'.

The bug is related to incorrect mappings of specific CSRs during disassembly, which affects the translation process. This falls under 'mistranslation'.

**Answer:**

mistranslation
