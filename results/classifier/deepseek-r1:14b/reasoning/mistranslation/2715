Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "QEMU AARCH64 only supports canonical addresses running on x64." The categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, let's understand the bug. It mentions QEMU and AARCH64, which is an architecture supported by QEMU. The issue is that canonical addresses are only supported when running on x64 systems. Canonical addressing typically refers to a way of handling virtual memory where addresses are normalized to a specific form, often used in user-space applications.

Looking at the categories: 'mistranslation' relates to incorrect mapping between source and target architectures, which could involve issues during assembly lowering. Since AARCH64 is an ARM-based architecture and x64 is AMD/Intel 64-bit, this might be a translation issue when running QEMU on x64 hosts for AARCH64 guests.

Other categories like 'network' or 'socket' don't seem relevant here as the bug isn't about networking. It's more about how QEMU handles memory addresses specifically for AARCH64 on x64 systems, which points towards a translation layer issue rather than device peripherals or hypervisor problems.

Therefore, 'mistranslation' seems appropriate because it likely involves incorrect handling of address translation from the host (x64) to the guest (AARCH64) architecture.

The bug report indicates an issue with QEMU's AARCH64 support on x64 systems specifically related to canonical addresses. Since this pertains to how QEMU translates and handles memory addresses between different architectures, it falls under 'mistranslation' as it involves incorrect semantic mapping from the source (x64) to the target (AARCH64) architecture.

**Answer: mistranslation**
