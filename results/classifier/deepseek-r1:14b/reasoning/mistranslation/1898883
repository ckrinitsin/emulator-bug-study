Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is having trouble with QEMU's riscv64 system failing to load a binary kernel into memory. They mentioned using `qemu-system-riscv64` and trying different options like `-kernel vmlinux` versus stripping it with `objcopy`. When they strip the kernel, QEMU doesn't load the binary correctly, but when they use `-bios`, it works. 

They also compared this to `qemu-system-aarch64`, which seems to handle both ELF and binary kernels without issues. The problem here is about loading a kernel into memory, specifically mentioning that the binary isn't being loaded as expected in riscv64 mode.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, and others like device, network, etc. Since this issue revolves around how QEMU loads kernels (which are binaries) into memory, it doesn't seem to be a translation or assembly problem. It's more about how QEMU handles kernel loading, which might fall under the 'other' category since none of the other specific categories like network or device seem to fit here.

Alternatively, perhaps it could be related to 'boot' issues because the kernel is part of the boot process. But the primary issue seems to be with the loading mechanism rather than the booting process itself. So I'm leaning towards 'other' as the most appropriate category.
