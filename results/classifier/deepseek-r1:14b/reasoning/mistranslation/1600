Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem is related to secure/non-secure page tables in the Hafnium project's SEL2/SPE firmware. The issue arises when transactions always resolve to the secure IPA space, leading to S2 page faults even though pages are mapped as NS (non-secure) in the VTTBR/VSTTBR-rooted page tables.

The user mentioned that this occurs when accessing a page shared between the SEL1 Trusted OS and the secure world. They provided specific settings for VTCR_EL2 and VSTCR_EL2, and noted that the same changes work fine on FVP but fail in QEMU.

Looking at the steps to reproduce, they involve building QEMU master and running a specific configuration with various devices like Virtio RNG and Virtio-net. The failure occurs during Linux boot when trying to share an NS page, resulting in a dead loop due to S2 PF.

So, the bug is about how secure/non-secure translations are handled in the MMU during SEL2 runtime on QEMU's Virt machine model. It seems like it's related to how page tables are split and resolved between secure and non-secure worlds.

The possible categories include "mistranslation," which refers to incorrect semantic mapping from source architecture to IR/target. Given that the problem is about MMU translation bits causing pages intended for NS to be treated as Secure, this likely falls under mistranslation in the user-mode assembly lowering context.
