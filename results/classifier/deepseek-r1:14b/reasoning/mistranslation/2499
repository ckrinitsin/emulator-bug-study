Okay, let's see. I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly lowering, or others like device, graphic, etc.

The bug is about m68k FPU instructions fsave and frestore not being enabled for 68020/68030 CPUs. Right now, these instructions only work on 68040 and cause an exception otherwise.

Looking at the code change provided, it shows that in translate.c, the condition checks if M68K_FEATURE_FPU is set instead of specifically M68K_FEATURE_M68040. This suggests that the issue is related to how QEMU handles FPU instructions for different CPU models.

Since fsave and frestore are FPU-related, and the problem lies in whether these instructions are allowed on 68020/68030, it's about enabling them correctly based on the CPU features. The current code mistakenly checks for M68K_FEATURE_M68040 instead of just having FPU support.

So, this seems to be a problem with how QEMU translates these instructions into the target machine code. It's not an incorrect semantic mapping but more about feature handling in the translation process. Therefore, it might fall under 'assembly lowering' as it's adjusting how the instructions are handled based on CPU features.
