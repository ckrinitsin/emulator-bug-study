Alright, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the details carefully.

The user is building QEMU on ARM to run x86_64 executables in user mode. They've configured it with --target-list=x86_64-linux-user and other flags. The test program they're running uses sys_futex(), which is causing a segmentation fault when using qemu-x86_64.

Looking at the provided information, the issue seems to be related to system calls in user-mode translation. The problem occurs specifically with x86_64 targets but works for i386. This suggests that there's an incorrect handling or mapping of the futex syscall in the QEMU translation layer for x86_64.

The possible categories include 'mistranslation' which refers to issues in how source architecture instructions are translated into IR or the target. Since this is a user-mode issue and involves a system call not being handled correctly, it likely falls under mistranslation.
