Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The user provided a list: mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report is about QEMU refusing to multiboot Elf64 kernels when emulating x86_64 systems. The user explains that this issue makes the `-kernel` option less useful because a bootloader like GRUB or Syslinux can load 64-bit ELF kernels fine now, but QEMU doesn't support it anymore.

Looking at the categories, 'boot' seems to fit here because multibooting is related to how the system starts up and loads the kernel. The issue isn't about translation between architectures (mistranslation), nor assembly lowering. It's more about the boot process not working as intended with 64-bit kernels.

I also considered other categories like 'kernel' or 'hypervisor,' but 'boot' is more specific to the initial loading phase, which this bug directly affects.

The issue is related to how QEMU handles the booting process of 64-bit kernels, so the most appropriate category is:

**boot**
