Okay, I need to classify the given bug report into one of the provided categories. Let's read through the problem again.

The user converted a Parallels Windows 2012 R2 image to raw and qcow2 using qemu-img convert. After creating a new VM entry with Virtual Machine Manager and trying to boot, they get "no Bootable device." 

In Test 1, they tried overwriting the target disk by mounting both source and target images and copying files. However, after rebooting, there was a blue screen error related to prl_strg.sys.

Test 2 worked fine with an Ubuntu image, so the issue seems specific to Windows 2012 R2 conversion.

Possible categories: boot, device, graphic, network, etc. The main issue is that after conversion, the VM doesn't boot properly. Since it's about not finding a bootable device after converting and setting up the VM, the primary category would be 'boot'. Alternatively, it could relate to devices or disk issues, but since the problem occurs during boot, 'boot' seems most fitting.

Wait, but the issue might also be related to how the image is converted. Maybe there's a problem with the translation from Parallels format to raw/qcow2, which affects the device setup for booting. So perhaps it's a device or storage issue. However, the immediate error during boot points more towards 'boot'.

But considering that the conversion process might have altered how the disk is recognized by QEMU, leading to no bootable device detected, it could also be under 'device'. Alternatively, if the problem lies in the translation step, maybe 'mistranslation' or 'assembly' but those don't seem right here.

Another angle: when they tried overwriting with another Windows image, it caused a blue screen. This suggests that the issue is related to how the disk is set up post-conversion, possibly affecting boot components. But since the primary error is about no bootable device upon first attempt, 'boot' seems appropriate.
