Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report from QEMU. Let me read through it carefully.

The user reported that when they use `-cpu max` or `-cpu max,lpa2=off`, booting Linux hangs. But when they switch to `-cpu cortex-a57`, it works fine. They followed specific steps to set up their environment, including using a mini.iso from Ubuntu, creating images with dd commands, and modifying flash0.img with an EDK2 binary.

From the description, the problem occurs during booting, specifically after selecting install when running QEMU. The kernel hangs, which suggests something goes wrong during the initialization process. They mentioned that pm215 suggested it might be an old EDK2 version not handling newer CPU features properly, so updating EDK2 could fix it.

Looking at the possible categories: boot, graphic, network, etc. Since the issue is about QEMU's CPU configuration causing a hang during installation and booting, "boot" seems like the most relevant category. The problem isn't related to graphics, networking, or other areas listed.

The bug report involves issues with booting Linux under specific CPU configurations in QEMU. Since the problem occurs during the boot process and is related to CPU options, the appropriate category is **boot**.

Answer: boot
