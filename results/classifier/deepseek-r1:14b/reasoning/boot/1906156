Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report is about a macOS guest on a Linux host. The issue occurs when loading a kext (kernel extension) in the guest. It works after a full host reboot but fails if only the guest reboots, requiring another host reboot to fix. 

Looking at the possible categories: 
- 'boot' relates to startup issues, which seems relevant here since the problem happens post-reboot.
- The failure is related to loading a driver in the guest OS, which might tie into how QEMU handles device drivers or kernel modules.

Other categories like 'device' or 'kernel' could also be considered, but 'boot' specifically addresses issues during startup or after rebooting. Since the problem arises after reboots and involves kernel extensions (kext), it's more about the boot process of the guest OS within QEMU.

The issue is related to how the guest OS boots up and loads its components, particularly the kext. The failure occurs when the guest reboots but not the host, indicating a problem with the boot process in the VM context.

**Answer:** boot
