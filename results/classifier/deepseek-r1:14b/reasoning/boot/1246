Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "Win11_22H2_English_x64.iso won't boot". The possible categories are quite a list. Let me think through each one.

First, the issue is about an ISO not booting in QEMU. That suggests it's related to how QEMU handles the virtual machine setup. Since it's a Windows 11 ISO, maybe there's something wrong with the way QEMU emulates hardware or boots the OS.

Looking at the categories: 'boot' seems directly relevant because the problem is about the system not starting up correctly. Other options like 'network', 'graphic', or 'kernel' could be involved if the issue was specific to those areas, but the report doesn't mention any of those. The user just said it won't boot, which points more towards a general booting problem.

So, I think the correct category here is 'boot'.

The bug report indicates that the ISO isn't booting in QEMU, pointing to an issue with the VM's startup process.

**Answer:**
boot
