Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is about QEMU crashing with a kernel panic on Windows when using a specific command. It works fine on Linux but causes issues on Windows, even though the Windows version works with arm-test images from qemu.org.

Looking at the details: it's related to bringing up 64-bit ARM support and the issue occurs during boot because of an arithmetic syntax error in the kernel. The user tried both custom-built QEMU and a pre-installed one, so it's not isolated to any specific build process.

The categories include 'boot' which seems relevant since it happens when trying to start the system. Other possibilities might be 'kernel' because it's a panic related to the kernel. But since the problem occurs during boot-up on Windows specifically, I think 'boot' is more precise.
