Okay, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is reporting that QEMU's aarch64 cannot boot Linux kernels starting from version 4.6+. They've provided details about their environment, build commands, and the specific error they're encountering.

From the information given, the issue seems related to the kernel not booting properly with QEMU. The user did a git bisect and found that a specific commit in the Linux kernel caused the problem. This commit adds support for ARMv8.2 features, specifically id_aa64mmfr2. They suspect this might be due to changes in struct definitions not being handled correctly by QEMU.

I need to categorize this bug report based on the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about QEMU failing to boot a kernel after a certain version. This seems related to how QEMU handles the machine's architecture and the features it supports. Since the problem arises from changes in the CPU feature handling (specifically ARMv8.2), it's likely that QEMU isn't correctly emulating these new features or the way they're detected.

Looking at the categories, 'boot' seems appropriate because the issue is about the kernel not starting up properly. However, another possibility could be under 'hypervisor' since QEMU acts as a hypervisor for AArch64 machines, but 'boot' might be more specific here. Alternatively, it could fall under 'kernel' if the problem is with how QEMU interacts with the Linux kernel's features.

But considering that the issue arises from changes in the CPU identification and feature handling, which are part of the machine setup during boot, 'boot' seems like the most fitting category.

The bug report is about a failure to boot a Linux kernel using QEMU. The issue relates to specific changes in the kernel's ARMv8.2 features not being properly handled by QEMU, causing the kernel to fail during the boot process. Since the problem occurs during the boot phase, the appropriate category is:

**boot**
