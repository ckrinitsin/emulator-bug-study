Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "hw/riscv reset vector improvement". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

First, let me understand what the bug is about. It's under hw/riscv, which suggests it's related to hardware or more specifically, the RISC-V architecture in QEMU. The term "reset vector" refers to the starting address where the CPU jumps after a reset, usually pointing to the initial instructions for booting up.

So this isn't about translating code incorrectly (mistranslation) or assembly lowering (assembly). It's also not related to networking, sockets, graphics, or KVM as far as I can tell. 

Looking at the categories provided, "boot" seems relevant because a reset vector is crucial for the boot processâ€”it determines where the system starts executing code after resetting. Alternatively, it could be under "peripherals" since reset vectors are part of hardware initialization, but "boot" feels more specific here.

I don't think it's any of the others like performance or kernel. So I'm leaning towards either "boot" or maybe "device". But considering that the reset vector is directly involved in the boot sequence, "boot" seems like the most appropriate category.
