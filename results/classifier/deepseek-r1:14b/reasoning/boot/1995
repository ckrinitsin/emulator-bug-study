Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "No equivalent of `-boot once` for `bootindex`" in QEMU. The categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, I'll break down the bug report. It's saying there's no equivalent option for `-boot once` when dealing with `bootindex`. So it's about how QEMU handles booting, specifically regarding the order or selection of devices to boot from.

Looking at the categories, "boot" seems directly related. The issue is about a missing feature in the booting process, so it falls under the category that deals with boot-related functionalities. 

Other options like device or peripherals might be considered since bootindex relates to which device is used for booting, but the main focus here is on the absence of an option, not necessarily the devices themselves. Therefore, "boot" is the most appropriate category because it's about how QEMU manages the boot process.

The bug report pertains to a missing feature in the boot configuration of QEMU, specifically regarding the `bootindex` and `-boot once` options. This directly relates to how QEMU handles the booting process.

**Answer:** boot
