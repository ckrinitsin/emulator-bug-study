Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report related to QEMU. Let me read through the details again carefully. The user is reporting an issue where using the `-hda //./PhysicalDrive1` option in QEMU doesn't work when the drive is a USB flash drive. Instead of booting properly, it just opens a blank window without any BIOS messages. They mentioned that this works fine with older versions or if they use a raw image file instead. 

Hmm, so the problem seems to be specific to using a physical USB drive as the boot device in QEMU. The user is running QEMU on Windows 7 x64, which might have some implications regarding how QEMU handles hardware devices.

Looking at the categories provided: boot, device, graphic, network, etc. I need to figure out where this issue fits. Since the problem occurs during the boot process and involves a USB drive not being recognized properly, it's likely related to how QEMU interacts with hardware devices.

The fact that using a raw image works suggests that the issue isn't with the image itself but rather with how QEMU accesses the physical drive. So maybe this is an issue with device handling or perhaps the hypervisor component if it's related to KVM, but I'm not sure.

Wait, QEMU under Windows might use different mechanisms for accessing hardware. USB drives are devices, so perhaps there's a problem in how QEMU interfaces with the host's USB devices when using physical disks versus image files. This could fall under the 'device' category because it's about handling specific hardware devices during boot.

Alternatively, since the primary issue is that the system isn't booting correctly when using a USB drive, maybe it's more of a boot problem. The user didn't get any BIOS messages, which might indicate that QEMU isn't initializing the device properly during the boot process. That makes me think 'boot' could be the category.

But considering that the issue is specifically with a physical USB drive and not with image files or virtual disks, it's more about how QEMU interacts with hardware devices. So 'device' might be more accurate because it pertains to the interaction between QEMU and the actual hardware device being used as storage.

I'm a bit torn between 'boot' and 'device'. The primary action here is during boot, but the root cause seems to be related to device handling. Therefore, I think classifying this under 'device' makes more sense because it's about the USB drive not being recognized correctly.
