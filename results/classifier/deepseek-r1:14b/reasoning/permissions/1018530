Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The user is having trouble with write access in a 9p/virtfs shared folder. Let me read through the details carefully.

They set up a shared folder using libvirt, specified as type 'mount' with accessmode 'passthrough'. They mounted it inside the VM using mount -t 9p with some options. The permissions on the host are all 777, but they can't write in the VM. However, another similar setup with an NTFS filesystem works fine.

Hmm, so the problem is specifically with XFS as the original filesystem. They're using Ubuntu 12.04 and QEMU-KVM version 1.0+noroms-0ubuntu13.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue seems related to how file permissions are handled when accessing the shared folder. Since it's a 9p/virtfs setup, which is a virtual filesystem in QEMU/KVM, and they're encountering write permission issues despite correct host permissions, it might be a problem with how the permissions are being translated or enforced within the VM.

I think this falls under 'permissions' because it's about file access rights not being properly handled. Alternatively, since it's related to the virtual filesystem setup, maybe 'files'? But 'permissions' seems more specific to the issue described.
