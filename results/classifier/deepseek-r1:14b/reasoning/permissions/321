Okay, so I have to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. The bug is: "qemu 5.2.0 configure script explodes when in read only directory." 

First, let's understand what each category means. The options are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is about the configure script exploding (which probably means it fails or crashes) when in a read-only directory. The configure script is part of the build process for QEMU; it generates the Makefile and other necessary configurations based on the system's setup and user options.

Looking at the categories, none directly mention 'configure' or 'script'. Mistranslation is about incorrect semantic mappings during compilation, which doesn't fit here. Assembly is about lowering code to assembly, not applicable. Other is a catch-all, but perhaps there's a better fit.

Device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug â€“ these are all related to specific components or functionalities of QEMU. The issue isn't with any of those.

Looking further, 'files' might be relevant because it's about handling files during the configure process, but specifically, the problem is with permissions since the directory is read-only. So 'permissions' seems a good fit.

Alternatively, 'other' could be considered, but since the bug relates to how QEMU interacts with file system permissions during configuration, 'permissions' is more precise.

The bug involves the configure script failing due to file permission issues in a read-only directory, which falls under the category of handling file permissions. Therefore, the appropriate classification is:

permissions
