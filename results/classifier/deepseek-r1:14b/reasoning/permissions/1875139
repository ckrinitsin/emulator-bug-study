Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report for QEMU. Let me see what the issue is.

The user reports that when they try to start a domain using Virt-manager, it fails because the 'readonly' device isn't writable. They mention that their root disk is an LVM2 thin snapshot marked as read-only. When attempting to start the domain, QEMU throws an error indicating the device is not writable due to permission denied.

So, in this case, the problem occurs when a block device is set as read-only but QEMU tries to access it for writing anyway. The user points out that setting it to read-write fixes the issue, and they're confused why QEMU needs write access if the device is supposed to be read-only.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

I think this issue relates to block devices and their permissions. The error is about QEMU not being able to write to a read-only device, which suggests it's trying to access the device with incorrect permissions or without respecting the read-only flag. So the category should relate to how devices are handled in terms of permissions or file access.

Looking at the options, "files" and "permissions" come to mind. The error is about not having write permission, so it's a permissions issue when accessing the block device. Therefore, the appropriate category would be "permissions."

I don't think it's a mistranslation because that usually relates to incorrect mapping in code translation, which doesn't seem relevant here. It's more about how QEMU handles file access and permissions when trying to use a read-only device.
