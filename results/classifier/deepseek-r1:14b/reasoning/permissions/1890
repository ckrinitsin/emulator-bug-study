Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. Let's look at the details.

The user ran a command with qemu-arm and got an error: "Error mapping file: Operation not permitted." They tried to execute a Cortex-M binary called hello_world. Steps to reproduce included compiling with arm-none-eabi-gcc, then running under QEMU.

Looking at the error message, it mentions "Operation not permitted" when trying to map the file. This suggests a permissions issue, possibly related to how QEMU is accessing the file. The user also noted that version 8.0.4 worked but 8.1.0 didn't. So it's likely a regression in newer versions.

Possible categories include 'files' and 'permissions'. Since the error directly relates to file mapping permissions, I think 'permissions' fits here. It's about QEMU not having the necessary access rights to the file being executed.

The bug report involves an "Operation not permitted" error when trying to map a file during execution. This is related to file permissions, as QEMU might lack the required permissions to access or execute the binary file.
