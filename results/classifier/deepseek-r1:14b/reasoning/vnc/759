Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The issue is about copy-and-paste not working over VNC in QEMU.

First, looking at the description: the user can't copy or paste between the host and guest when using VNC. They mentioned that Gtk works fine, so it's specific to the VNC connection.

The steps to reproduce involve building QEMU with certain options, including enabling VNC and other features. Then running the VM with VNC server and connecting via vncviewer. The problem occurs during copy-paste attempts in the terminal.

Additional info points out that an article claims copy-paste is supported on VNC, implying this should work but doesn't.

The possible categories include 'vnc' as one of them. Since the issue directly relates to VNC functionality and not other areas like assembly or graphics, it fits under 'vnc'.
