Alright, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU's VNC WebSocket proxy requiring a non-standard 'binary' subprotocol. Let me go through the details step by step.

The user mentioned that when using "-vnc" with the "websocket" option in QEMU, it requires the 'binary' subprotocol, which isn't part of the standard WebSocket specs. They pointed out that this causes issues because clients like noVNC can't connect unless they're modified to request 'binary', which is incorrect behavior.

Looking at the code provided in channel-websock.c, there's some hardcoding related to 'binary'. The problem revolves around how QEMU handles WebSocket connections and subprotocols, specifically with VNC.

The categories I have are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

I'm thinking this is related to the VNC protocol's interaction over WebSocket. Since it's about how QEMU's WebSocket proxy behaves with subprotocols and affects client connections, it's more specific than just 'network' or 'socket'. The bug directly impacts the VNC functionality when using WebSocket, which ties into the VNC category.
