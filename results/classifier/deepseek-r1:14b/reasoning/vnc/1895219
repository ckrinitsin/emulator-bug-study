Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user provided a list: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report is about QEMU failing when using the -vnc option because it can't find the 'en-us' keymap. The error message says it couldn't read the keymap file and mentions that the share/keymaps directory only has 'sl' and 'sv', but previous versions had 'en-us'.

Looking at the categories, I should figure out which one best fits this issue. The problem is related to VNC in QEMU, specifically with a missing keymap file. Since it's about a missing file or resource that's required for VNC functionality, the category 'vnc' seems appropriate because it directly relates to how QEMU handles VNC connections and their configurations.

I don't think it's about device drivers or peripherals because the issue is not hardware-related but rather software configuration. It's also not about network connectivity itself; it's more about the setup for the graphical interface (VNC). So 'vnc' is the right category here.
