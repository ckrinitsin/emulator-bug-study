Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The bug mentions usermode emulation warnings related to x2apic, tsc-deadline, pcid, and invpcid features being system-only. These terms are all related to CPU instructions or virtualization features that might be handled by KVM, which is a hypervisor.

I remember that KVM stands for Kernel-based Virtual Machine, so issues with these specific features likely fall under the hypervisor category since they involve how QEMU interacts with the host's virtualization capabilities. Other categories like 'device' or 'graphic' don't seem to fit here because the problem isn't about hardware devices or display issues.

The warnings are about system-only features not being supported in user-mode, which suggests it's a hypervisor-related issue because KVM operates at the kernel level for better performance and access to low-level virtualization features. Therefore, this bug should be categorized under 'KVM'.
