Okay, I'm looking at this bug report about QEMU with Windows 98 SE under RHEL6.2/CentOS6.2. The user mentioned two main issues. 

The first issue is that when running in KVM mode, the screen goes black just after the installer finishes and switches to Win98. This suggests a problem related to virtualization or the hypervisor. Since KVM stands for Kernel-based Virtual Machine, which is part of the hypervisor layer, this category seems relevant.

The second issue is about BIOS Plug-and-Play drivers not working in QEMU mode, leading to devices like CDROM and network driver not being recognized. However, since they ran it successfully in QEMU mode, maybe it's more related to device emulation or peripherals. But the first issue specifically points to KVM.

So considering both issues, but especially the first one which directly mentions KVM failure, I think the correct category is 'KVM'.

The bug report involves issues when running Windows 98 SE under QEMU in KVM mode and non-KVM mode. The primary issue occurs in KVM mode where the screen goes black after installation. This points to a problem with the hypervisor, which is handled by KVM. While there are device-related issues in QEMU mode, the main focus is on KVM's failure.

**KVM**

The correct category for this bug report is **KVM**.
