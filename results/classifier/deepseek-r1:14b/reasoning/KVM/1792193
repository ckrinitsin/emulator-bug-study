Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user upgraded from QEMU 2.12.0-2 to 3.0.0-1 and now can't load a VM when using "-cpu host". The VM works fine with the older version. They're running Arch Linux on the VM. The issue occurs whether they use "-cpu host" or "-cpu athlon". 

So, the problem is related to CPU configuration in QEMU after an upgrade. When using "-cpu host", it's supposed to use the host's CPU features for the guest. But with their AMD Athlon X2 processor, this causes GRUB to fail when trying to load the initial ramdisk.

I know that KVM is involved because they're enabling it with "-enable-kvm". The issue seems to be in how QEMU/KVM handles the CPU configuration, especially for older processors like the Athlon X2. Maybe there's a regression in the newer version where certain CPUs aren't being emulated correctly.

Looking at the categories: KVM is directly related since they're using it for virtualization. The problem isn't with translation, assembly, or graphics; it's more about how the CPU model is handled during VM startup, which ties into the hypervisor function provided by KVM.
