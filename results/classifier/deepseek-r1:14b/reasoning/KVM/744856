Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The user mentioned that they can't boot their machine when using more than 6 disks since QEMU-KVM version 0.13. They tried up to 14 drives and encountered an error where there's no bootable disk.

Looking at the possible categories, I see options like 'device', 'network', 'KVM', etc. The issue here is about passing multiple disks to the guest, which relates to how QEMU handles disk devices. Since it's related to the number of disks and booting problems, this points towards a device-related problem, specifically with disk handling in KVM.

The user tested both with and without VirtIO, so it's not limited to any specific I/O driver. The core issue is that beyond 6 disks, the machine fails to recognize a bootable disk, which suggests a limitation or bug in how QEMU manages multiple devices during the boot process. Therefore, this should fall under the 'KVM' category as it pertains to virtual machine configuration and device handling within KVM.

The issue is related to passing more than 6 disks to a guest in QEMU-KVM, which affects the booting process. This falls under the 'KVM' category since it's about managing devices (disks) in a KVM virtual machine.

**Answer:**

KVM
