Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The bug report says: "Property not found when using aarch64 -machine=virt,secure=on with KVM enabled."

First, let me break down the components here. The user is using QEMU with aarch64 architecture and specific machine options. They're enabling secure mode (-secure=on) and using KVM (which stands for Kernel-based Virtual Machine, a hypervisor). The issue is that a property isn't found under these conditions.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. Since the bug involves KVM specifically, that seems like a direct hit. The mention of using KVM in the command line points towards it being related to the hypervisor component.

So, I think the category here is "KVM." It's about an issue when KVM is enabled, so it falls under hypervisor-related problems.
