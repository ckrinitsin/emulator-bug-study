Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the problem again.

The user reports that the KVM flag isn't exposed by default. They mention that according to the source code, it should be exposed when using an X86CPU model. However, they have to manually add "kvm=on" in QEMU's custom CPU arguments. Additionally, libvirt can't expose KVM because it assumes the flag is already available, only allowing "kvm hidden='true'".

Looking at the possible categories: KVM is one of them. The issue revolves around how KVM flags are handled, specifically that they're not exposed by default when they should be under certain conditions. This relates directly to the KVM hypervisor functionality in QEMU.

Other categories like 'mistranslation', 'assembly', or 'network' don't fit here because the problem isn't about instruction translation or network issues. It's more about how KVM features are managed and exposed, which falls under the KVM category.
