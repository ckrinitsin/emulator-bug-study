Okay, so I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. Let's read through the problem description carefully.

The user reported a build error when trying to build QEMU on Alpine Linux using RISC-V KVM. The error messages indicate undefined references to `strerrorname_np` in the `kvm.c` file. From the provided logs, it seems that during the build process, the linker can't find this function.

I know that `strerrorname_np` is a GNU-specific and non-portable function, which might not be available on all systems, especially those using different C libraries like Alpine Linux's musl. The user also mentioned that other parts of QEMU use `strerror(errno)` instead, suggesting that the problematic code isn't consistent with how errors are handled elsewhere.

Looking at the categories provided: the issue is related to KVM since it's happening in the RISC-V KVM target. There's no mention of user-mode assembly or semantic mapping issues, so 'mistranslation' doesn't fit here. The problem is during the build process, specifically a linker error due to an undefined function. This seems more like a compatibility issue with the system libraries rather than an issue with device drivers, graphics, sockets, etc.

The category that best fits this situation is 'KVM' because it's directly related to the KVM target in QEMU and the build failure is within the KVM-related code.
