Okay, so I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is talking about seeing a lot of kvm rdmsr error messages on the console, specifically in /dev/tty1. They tried using "echo 1 > /sys/module/kvm/parameters/ignore_msrs" but the messages still appear. The messages look like they're from QEMU's KVM hypervisor, mentioning vcpu0 and specific MSRs.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user is dealing with messages related to KVM. They're trying to suppress these error logs, which are appearing on the console even after their attempt. The issue seems specific to how KVM handles logging in QEMU. 

The commands they used relate directly to the KVM module parameters, so it's definitely a KVM-related issue. The messages themselves mention 'kvm' and 'vcpu', further pointing towards KVM.

I don't see any indication that this is about assembly or mistranslation; it's more about logging behavior in the hypervisor component of QEMU. So the most appropriate category here would be "KVM".

The bug report is related to suppressing kvm rdmsr error messages, which are part of the KVM module and its interaction with virtual CPUs. The user tried adjusting a parameter but still faces the issue, indicating it's specific to how KVM logs these errors. Since the focus is on KVM behavior and logging suppression within QEMU, the category is:

KVM
