Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU into one of the given categories. Let me read through the information carefully.

The user mentioned that KVM crashes when attempting to restart migration. They provided a detailed sequence of steps leading to the crash: starting two KVM systems, connecting to the monitor, migrating, checking info, canceling migration, restarting migration, and then the crash occurs with an assertion failure in block-migration.c. 

Looking at the categories, I see "KVM" as one of them. Since the issue is directly related to KVM crashing during a migration process, which is a feature specific to KVM's management within QEMU, this seems like the most fitting category.

Other possible categories like "network" or "device" might be involved because migration involves network communication and device handling, but the core issue here is that KVM itself is crashing. Therefore, categorizing it under "KVM" makes sense as it directly points to a problem within the KVM component during its operation.

The bug report describes an issue where KVM crashes during a migration restart. The key point is the crash happening in the KVM process when handling the migration procedure, which falls under KVM's specific functionality.
