Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user is reporting an issue when migrating a KVM guest from QEMU 2.5.0 to 2.4.1. The error message mentions "fw_cfg" and a problem with the DMA interface that was added recently. They mention that this relates to a change in QEMU where fw_cfg gained a DMA interface, which might not be compatible across different versions.

Looking at the categories, KVM is directly related since it's about virtual machines under KVM. The issue occurs during migration, which involves KVM and possibly device configurations. The error points to a specific device ('fw_cfg') within QEMU, suggesting it's a device-related problem, but since it's specifically KVM migration, the primary category would be KVM.

I don't see any mention of assembly or mistranslation, so those are unlikely. The issue is not about graphics, sockets, network directly (though DMA could relate to networking, it's more tied to device configuration here). It's about compatibility during migration between QEMU versions affecting a specific device under KVM.
