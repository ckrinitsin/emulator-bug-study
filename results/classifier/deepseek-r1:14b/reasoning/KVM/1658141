Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The user reports that when running Wine's conformance tests on Windows 10 64-bit in QEMU, a BSOD occurs with "KMOD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED". They provided steps to reproduce and some logs. The issue happens only on Intel hosts, not AMD ones, and affects both QEMU versions 2.1 and 2.7, as well as different Linux kernels.

Looking at the kernel logs, they saw messages related to KVM about unhandled rdmsr accesses. They also found a solution by adjusting kvm's ignore_msrs parameter, which suggests it's related to how KVM handles certain MSRs (Model-Specific Registers).

The categories provided include 'KVM', among others. Since the problem is tied to KVM module messages and involves MSRs handled by KVM, this seems directly related to the hypervisor layer.

The bug report mentions issues with KVM kernel module messages and adjusting KVM parameters to fix it. Therefore, it's categorized under:

**KVM**
