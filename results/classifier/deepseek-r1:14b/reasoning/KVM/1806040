Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user is experiencing an issue with QEMU related to Nested VMX virtualization and live migration not being supported. They mentioned that after updating QEMU from Git, they can't create snapshots due to this error. 

Looking at the provided categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc., I need to determine which one fits best. The error is about Nested VMX virtualization, which is a feature related to KVM hypervisor support in QEMU. KVM allows for full hardware-assisted virtualization and nested virtualization would be an extension of that.

The user's setup uses the '-hypervisor' parameter with 'kvm=off', but they're still encountering issues. They found that a specific commit caused the problem, which likely modified how Nested VMX is handled in KVM. The error message directly points to a limitation in QEMU regarding live migration with nested VMX.

So, considering all this, the most appropriate category here would be 'KVM' because it's related to the hypervisor functionality and virtualization features within that context.
