Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "Why qemu crashes and calling SYS_SECCOMP function". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, I should understand what the bug report is about. It mentions QEMU crashing when calling SYS_SECCOMP. SYS_SECCOMP refers to the Seccomp (Secure Computation) system call filtering mechanism in Linux. In QEMU, this is often used in conjunction with KVM for security purposes, restricting the guest OS's access to certain syscalls.

The bug report doesn't specify the exact cause but links the crash to calling SYS_SECCOMP. So, I'm thinking about how Seccomp interacts with QEMU and KVM. Since Seccoop is a kernel feature that restricts system calls, and QEMU/KVM uses it for isolation in virtual machines.

Looking at the categories: 'KVM' seems relevant because Seccomp is used within KVM setups to enhance security. The crash could be due to an issue in how QEMU handles Seccomp-related syscalls during virtualization.

Other possible categories like 'kernel' might also fit, but since it's specifically related to QEMU and its use of KVM for virtualization, 'KVM' seems more precise.

The bug report involves a crash when calling SYS_SECCOMP within QEMU. Since Seccomp is often used with KVM for security, the issue likely relates to how QEMU handles this in the context of KVM.

KVM
