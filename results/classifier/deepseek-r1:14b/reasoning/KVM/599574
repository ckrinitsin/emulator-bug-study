Okay, so I need to classify this bug report from QEMU into one of the given categories. The user mentioned that when using the "-no-reboot" option with KVM in version 12.x, QEMU doesn't do anything and exits immediately without any output or error. However, when they add "--no-kvm", it works as expected. This issue doesn't occur in versions 11.0 and 11.1.

First, I'll look at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug is related to the "-no-reboot" option not working as intended when used with KVM. Since it works fine without KVM (using "--no-kvm"), the problem seems specific to how QEMU handles KVM in this context. The issue isn't about assembly translation or performance; rather, it's a misbehavior of an option related to the hypervisor.

I remember that "-no-reboot" is supposed to prevent the virtual machine from rebooting after a crash. If it's broken with KVM, it points towards an issue in how QEMU interacts with the KVM hypervisor. The user tested multiple 12.x versions and saw consistent failure, which suggests it's a regression or a bug introduced in that version.

Looking at the categories, "KVM" seems directly relevant here because the problem occurs when using KVM. Other options like boot, vnc, etc., don't seem to fit as this is specifically about KVM behavior with an option.

The issue pertains to how QEMU interacts with KVM when using a specific option, indicating a problem within the KVM hypervisor context.
