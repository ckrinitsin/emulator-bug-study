Okay, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. Let's see what the problem is.

The user mentioned that QEMU 2.10 now locks image files and warns if an image is locked, which can prevent QEMU from running and might corrupt the image. They also pointed out that there's no way to determine if the QEMU binary has this capability or how to disable it via the CLI. 

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about image locking behavior in QEMU. It's related to how images are handled when running a VM. The user wants a way to check if the feature is enabled and disable it through CLI options like 'file.locking=off'. 

From the categories, "files" seems relevant because it involves file handling (locking). There's no mention of translation issues or assembly problems, so mistranslation and assembly don't fit. It doesn't fall under network, device, or other specific areas like graphics or sockets.

Therefore, the appropriate category is "files."
