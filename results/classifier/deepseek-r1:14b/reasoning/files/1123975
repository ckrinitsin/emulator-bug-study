Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user is reporting an issue with QEMU where they can't restore a live snapshot made in QEmu 1.1 when using version 1.3+. The error message mentions "Error -22 while loading VM state." 

Looking at the possible categories, this seems related to how QEMU handles snapshots across different versions. Since snapshots are files and their format might have changed between versions, it's likely a compatibility issue with file handling. The error could be due to changes in how QEMU reads or writes snapshot data.

The problem doesn't seem to involve assembly translation or performance issues. It's more about the inability to load the state from a file, which points towards files as the category.
