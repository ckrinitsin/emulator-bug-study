Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user mentioned an error with QEMU when trying to open a qcow2 file: "Bitmap Extra data is not supported." They were using dirty bitmaps and drive-backup which worked before but now they can't access the image.

First, I know that QEMU uses various backends and drivers for storage. The error message points to an issue with bitmap extra data, which is related to how images are managed, especially when snapshots or backups are involved. Dirty bitmaps track changes in virtual machines to optimize storage operations.

Looking at the possible categories: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. Since this involves qcow2 images and storage issues, it's likely under 'storage' which falls under 'files' category. The error is about an unsupported feature (extra data in bitmaps), so it's a bug in how QEMU handles image files.

I don't think it's related to the hypervisor itself but more to how storage devices are managed within the VM setup. So, the most appropriate category would be 'files' since it's dealing with file operations and storage handling.

The error is related to storage handling within QEMU, specifically involving qcow2 images and bitmaps. The issue pertains to an unsupported feature in image files.

**Answer:** files
