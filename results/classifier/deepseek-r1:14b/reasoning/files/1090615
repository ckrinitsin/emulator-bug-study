Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is talking about qemu-img info and check not providing enough information. They want more details like in-use disk size, compressed clusters, and fragmentation estimation. From what I remember, qemu-img is a tool for managing disk images used by QEMU. 

Looking at the provided categories: assembly, device, graphic, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and others like mistranslation.

The issue here isn't about any of the specific ones like graphics or networking. It's more about how qemu-img provides information and analysis on disk images. Since it's related to the functionality of a tool that deals with disk images, which are part of the storage handling in QEMU, I think 'files' might be relevant because it's about file operations and their properties.

Alternatively, maybe 'other' since the categories don't have an exact match for image analysis features. But considering the context, 'files' seems more appropriate as it pertains to how files (disk images) are being used and checked.

The bug report is related to the functionality of qemu-img, specifically requesting additional information about disk images. Since this involves file operations and their properties, the most fitting category is:

**files**
