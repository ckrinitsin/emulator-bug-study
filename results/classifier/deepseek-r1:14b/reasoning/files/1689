Alright, let's try to figure out which category this bug report falls into. The user is talking about using QEMU's memory backend with a file and facing issues with write permissions when they don't think it's necessary.

So, the problem is that when using `-object memory-backend-file`, even if `share=off` and `readonly=on`, QEMU still requires the backing file to be writable. The user wants it to work without needing write permissions because they're using a copy-on-write style with `MAP_PRIVATE`.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about file permissions and how QEMU handles them when setting up memory backends. The user mentions mmap flags and file opening modes, which relates to how the system interacts with files and their access rights. This seems more related to file handling rather than something like device drivers or network settings.

So, it's likely under "files" since it's about file operations and permissions in QEMU. Alternatively, it could be "permissions" because of the discussion around read/write access. But considering the context is about memory mapping and file usage in QEMU, "files" seems more appropriate.

The bug report discusses issues with file handling and permissions when using a memory backend in QEMU. The user is concerned that QEMU unnecessarily requires write permission for the file even when it's only mapped privately, which relates to how files are accessed and their permissions. This falls under the category of file operations.
