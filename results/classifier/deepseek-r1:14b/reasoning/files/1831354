Okay, so I need to classify this bug report in QEMU into one of the given categories. The user mentioned that they're having trouble reading symlinks when mounting a 9p filesystem with the security_model set to "mapped". 

First, let me understand what's happening here. They're usingvirtio-9p-pci device and setting up a filesystem with some specific options. The problem occurs when using the "mapped-file" security model, but not when it's set to "none".

The key issue is that symlinks aren't being read properly. Symlinks are special in file systems because they point to other files or directories. If QEMU isn't handling them correctly under certain security models, it could be a problem with how the filesystem operations are being translated or handled in the guest.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

I think "files" makes sense here because it's related to file system operationsâ€”specifically how symlinks are handled when mounting a 9p filesystem. The problem isn't with the device itself (like virtio), but rather with how the files are being accessed and their metadata is processed.

Another category could be "permissions", but that usually relates to access rights, not the ability to read symlink data. Since it's about file operations and symlinks specifically, "files" seems more accurate.
