Okay, I need to classify the bug report provided by the user into one of the given categories. Let me start by understanding the issue.

The user is facing a problem when trying to restart their VM using virt-manager. The error message they're getting is: "Could not open 'poppy.qcow2': Could not read snapshots: File too large". They also tried using the command line tool qemu-img check, and it gave the same error. 

Looking at the versions they have, both qemu-img 2.0.0 (default install) and 2.1.50 (latest version) are showing this issue. The host is a Ubuntu 14.04 system with ample disk space, so it doesn't seem like an issue of insufficient storage.

Now, the error mentions that the file is too large when trying to read snapshots. This suggests that there might be a problem with how the qcow2 image is being handled by qemu-img or virt-manager. Since the user is restarting the VM and encountering this during disk image access, it's likely related to how the virtual machine reads its storage.

The categories provided are: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

I should consider what each category entails. "Files" might relate to issues with file handling or corruption. "Permissions" could be about access rights, but the user has enough space, so it's less likely. "mistranslation" seems related to incorrect mapping during compilation or execution. However, the error is more about accessing an image rather than code translation.

The issue here is that qemu-img cannot open the qcow2 file because it's too large for some operation, possibly reading snapshots. This could be a limitation in how qemu handles larger images, which would fall under "files" category as it's related to file operations and size constraints.
