Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user mentioned that qemu-system-x86_64 segfaults with kernel 3.5.0 but runs fine with RHEL 6's older kernel using qemu-kvm 1.1.1 stable. The issue happens while installing Ubuntu 12.04 server and is reproducible.

Segfaults are often related to crashes due to invalid memory accesses, which can be caused by issues in the hypervisor or how it interacts with the host kernel. Since the problem occurs when using a newer kernel (3.5.0) compared to RHEL 6's older one, it suggests that there might be compatibility issues between QEMU and the new kernel version.

Looking at the possible categories, "kernel" seems appropriate because the issue is related to how QEMU interacts with the host operating system's kernel. Alternatively, "hypervisor" could also fit since QEMU acts as a hypervisor when using KVM. However, in this case, the user specifically mentioned that qemu-kvm runs fine on RHEL 6, which uses an older kernel. The problem arises when switching to a newer kernel, pointing towards a kernel-related issue rather than the hypervisor itself.

Therefore, the most fitting category is "kernel."
