Okay, so I need to classify this bug report where QEMU refuses to multiboot Elf64 kernels. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the issue is with QEMU not allowing multiple boot options when using Elf64 kernels. Multibooting typically refers to the ability to boot from different operating systems or kernel versions on a single machine. So if QEMU isn't supporting this for Elf64, it's likely an issue with how QEMU handles kernel types.

Looking at the possible categories: hypervisor seems relevant because QEMU acts as a hypervisor when using KVM for full virtualization. The problem here is about booting multiple kernels, which relates to how the hypervisor initializes and manages the guest OS during startup.

Other categories like network or graphic might not fit since the issue isn't about networking or display problems. It's more about kernel loading and boot processes. So, the most fitting category would be hypervisor because it pertains to the virtualization layer that QEMU provides.
