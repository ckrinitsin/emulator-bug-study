Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "Unable to increase CPU's for existing RISCV VM". Let me think about the possible categories first.

The user provided several options: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. I have to pick one.

The bug is about not being able to increase CPUs in an existing RISC-V VM. So this is related to virtual machines and their configuration. The term "VM" here likely refers to a KVM guest since QEMU supports KVM for virtualization.

So the issue is with managing the VM's CPU count, which falls under the hypervisor category because KVM is a hypervisor. Therefore, the appropriate category is 'hypervisor'.
