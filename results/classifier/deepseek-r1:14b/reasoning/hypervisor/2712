Okay, so I have to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. Let me read through the problem again.

The issue is that a Windows VM isn't booting on QEMU KVM when the hypervisor is disabled in Linux 6.12. It works fine in Linux 6.11.10, so something changed between those versions. The user doesn't know if it's a kernel bug or if QEMU needs adjusting.

Looking at the categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The key here is "hypervisor=off" being set. The problem occurs when this parameter is used in Linux 6.12. Since the issue relates directly to the hypervisor setting and the VM not booting properly, it's likely a hypervisor-related bug.
