Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU. The user provided a list of categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The error message says "qemu-arm: Unable to reserve 0xffff0000 bytes... for use as guest address space." It mentions virtual memory settings and suggests using the -R option to reserve less. 

This seems related to how QEMU allocates memory for the guest OS. Since it's about reserving address space, which is part of the hypervisor's responsibilities, I think this falls under the 'hypervisor' category.
