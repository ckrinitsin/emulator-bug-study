Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories for QEMU. The options are mistranslation, assembly lowering, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, and other.

Looking at the problem description: Signal handlers in x86_64 userspace have a misaligned stack causing crashes due to 'movaps' getting a wrong address. The user provided details about how QEMU's signal handling might be misaligning the stack pointer when transferring control to the handler.

The key points are:
- It's an issue with signal handlers in x86_64.
- The stack is misaligned, leading to 'movaps' failing because it expects a 16-byte aligned address.
- QEMU's handling of the stack pointer for signal frames isn't correct according to the psABI.

The kernel code linked shows that the kernel adjusts the stack pointer based on whether it's an ia32 frame or not. For x86_64, 'sp' is rounded down and then 8 is subtracted. The user mentions that in QEMU, when jumping to the signal handler, $rsp ends with 0x..0 (aligned), which might be conflicting with what the ABI expects.

This seems related to how signals are handled at a low level, involving the stack pointer alignment, which is part of the system call or kernel interaction. However, since it's within QEMU's environment and not directly a kernel issue but rather a bug in how QEMU sets up the signal frame, it might be more about the hypervisor or emulation specifics.

Looking at the categories:
- 'hypervisor' seems appropriate because it pertains to how QEMU (the hypervisor/emulator) manages guest OS signals, including stack alignment.
- Alternatively, 'kernel' could be considered since it's related to signal handling, but the issue arises in the emulator itself, not the host kernel.

Therefore, the most fitting category is 'hypervisor'.
