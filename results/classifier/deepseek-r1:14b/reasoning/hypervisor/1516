Okay, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. The issue is about QEMU not reloading the kernel image when a guest reboots using direct kernel boot with virtiofs as the root filesystem.

The user describes that after updating the kernel inside the guest and rebooting, the old kernel is still used. Only a full power cycle (like stopping and starting the VM) makes the new kernel load. So, the problem occurs during reboot without needing to restart the entire VM manually.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The key here is that QEMU isn't reloading the kernel on reboot. This seems related to how the hypervisor (QEMU) handles reboots and kernel loading. Since the kernel is part of the VM's configuration, but the issue arises during a guest-initiated reboot, it's likely tied to the hypervisor's handling of such events.

Other possibilities: It could be a 'boot' category since it relates to booting the kernel, or maybe 'kernel', but I think 'hypervisor' is more accurate because the problem lies in how QEMU manages the VM state during reboots. The hypervisor needs to recognize that the kernel image has changed and reload it.

So, the best fit is 'hypervisor'.
