Okay, I need to classify this bug report. The issue is about OVMF not recognizing RAM when using QEMU with KVM on an Aarch64 system. OVMF EDK2 always detects 0 MB of RAM, causing OS crashes. 

Looking at the categories: it's related to QEMU and KVM, so hypervisor might be a fit. But more specifically, this seems like a hardware issue where the virtual machine isn't correctly reporting available memory. Since KVM is involved, which is part of the hypervisor layer, and the problem affects how resources (RAM) are allocated or detected by the guest OS, it's likely under the "hypervisor" category.

Alternatively, since the bug involves QEMU, which emulates devices and handles I/O, maybe a device issue. But the specific symptom points more towards resource allocation in the hypervisor environment. So I'll go with "hypervisor."
