Alright, let me try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user is having trouble with USB passthrough in QEMU. They followed a guide but the device isn't showing up on the guest. 

Looking at the logs, the guest sees a hub but no other devices. There are repeated errors about invalid ep0 maxpacket and unable to enumerate devices. On the host, the USB device is present. So it's not that the device isn't being passed through at all.

The problem seems related to how QEMU handles USB devices in KVM. Since they're using the `-usb` and `-device usb-host` options correctly, the issue might be with how the device is being exposed or handled by the hypervisor or the guest's USB stack.

Possible categories include 'hypervisor' since it's a KVM issue, but other options like 'device' or 'graphic' don't fit. The problem isn't about assembly or permissions directly. Considering that the issue affects device enumeration within the virtual machine, it likely falls under the hypervisor category.
