Okay, so I need to classify this bug report: "High CPU usage on AMD after migrating guests". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the bug is about high CPU usage specifically on AMD systems after migrating guests. Migrating guests usually refers to moving virtual machines between different hosts in a hypervisor environment. So this sounds related to how the hypervisor handles migration and resource allocation, especially CPU usage.

Looking at the categories, "hypervisor" seems relevant because it's about managing VMs and their resources. KVM is also mentioned as a category, but since the issue is about high CPU on AMD after migration, which might be a broader hypervisor issue rather than specific to KVM.

Other options like network or performance could be related, but "performance" would be more general, while "hypervisor" directly ties into VM management and resource allocation during migration. So I think the best category is "hypervisor".
