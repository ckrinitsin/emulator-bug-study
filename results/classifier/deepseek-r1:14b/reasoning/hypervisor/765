Okay, so I need to classify this bug report. The user is having an issue with Docker on their M1 Mac. They ran a specific command using Docker and got an error related to Go runtime's newosproc failing.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor, other.

The error message mentions "newosproc" which is related to OS thread creation. Docker on M1 Mac might be using QEMU as the hypervisor because Apple Silicon doesn't natively support x86 containers without it. The issue seems to be with creating new OS threads, possibly due to some limitation or incompatibility when running an amd64 container under QEMU on ARM.

So, this is likely a problem within the Docker runtime's handling of processes, which ties into the hypervisor aspect since Docker uses QEMU/KVM for x86 containers on M1. Therefore, the category should be 'hypervisor'.
