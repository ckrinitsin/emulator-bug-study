Alright, let me break down this bug report to classify it correctly. The user is encountering issues with QEMU running on different Linux distributions (Ubuntu minimal vs. Debian) on an Android device using Arch64 and Linux Deploy. They've listed four specific problems.

First, looking at issue 1: Windows guests beyond XP aren't working properly on Debian 9-10 and Ubuntu minimal, resulting in a black screen post-boot menu. This seems related to how QEMU handles the hardware or firmware mode (BIOS vs UEFI). Since it's about booting different OS versions, maybe it's tied to the way the guest OS is being emulated.

Issue 2 mentions fullscreen functionality failing on Debian but working on Ubuntu minimal. Fullscreen in QEMU typically involves window management and display settings, possibly related to how the host's display server or Xorg handles window resizing.

Issue 3 points out that Windows guests run slower (1 GHz vs 2 GHz) depending on the distribution. This might be about CPU configuration in QEMU, perhaps differences in how KVM is being utilized across distros.

Issue 4 states that enabling KVM isn't working and virtualization isn't detected. Since this is running on Android via Linux Deploy using a chroot, it could be an issue with how the hypervisor (KVM) interacts with the host OS or hardware. They suspect it's not a QEMU-KVM problem but related to running in a constrained environment.

The common thread across these issues seems to involve the interaction between QEMU and the host system, particularly regarding hardware acceleration (like KVM), display management, and possibly differences in how different Linux distros configure QEMU by default. Since all of these are about the hypervisor's behavior—how it interacts with the host OS, virtualization support, and guest performance—the most fitting category is 'hypervisor'.
