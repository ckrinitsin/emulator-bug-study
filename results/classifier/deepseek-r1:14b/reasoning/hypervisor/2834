Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user provided a detailed description of an issue they encountered when running QEMU with specific parameters. They got a warning about the host not supporting the feature "CPUID.07H:EBX.intel-pt [bit 25]". 

Looking at the command line, they're using `-cpu host,intel_pt` which suggests they want to enable Intel PT (Performance Tuning) for the virtual CPU. But QEMU is warning them that the host doesn't support this feature.

I know that KVM relies on certain hardware features to provide full virtualization capabilities. In this case, the user's CPU is an i5-13600kf. They ran some rdmsr commands to check specific MSRs related to Intel PT and VMX. The outputs are all 1s, which indicates that these features might be supported.

Wait, but why is QEMU still giving a warning? Maybe the host's CPU doesn't have Intel PT enabled in its feature set as detected by QEMU. Or perhaps there's an issue with how QEMU is detecting these features.

The user tried adding level/min-level=0x14, which relates to CPU feature levels, but it didn't help. This makes me think that the problem isn't about the CPU feature level but rather whether the host's hypervisor (KVM) can access or enable Intel PT for the VM.

So, this issue seems related to how QEMU/KVM interacts with the host's hardware features when setting up the virtual machine. Since it's a warning about missing support and involves KVM, I'd classify this under the "hypervisor" category because it's dealing with the hypervisor's ability to use specific CPU instructions or features.
