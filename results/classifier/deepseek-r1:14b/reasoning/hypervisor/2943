Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this bug report related to QEMU. Let's see what the user is asking for. They mentioned wanting to add a configurable option to disable KVM_X86_QUIRK_IGNORE_GUEST_PAT on Intel host CPUs or have it disabled by default. From their additional info, they did a grep and didn't find any references in the latest QEMU sources, which makes them think it's not handled or noticed before.

Hmm, so first, I need to understand what KVM_X86_QUIRK_IGNORE_GUEST_PAT is. From my limited knowledge, KVM is part of QEMU that allows for full virtualization using hardware extensions (like Intel's VT-x). The term "QUIRK" suggests it's a workaround or special handling for certain guest behaviors. So this quirk probably affects how the host handles the Guest PAT (Page Address Translation) in KVM.

The user is concerned about whether they can configure this setting and if it's currently enabled by default. Since they couldn't find any references, maybe QEMU isn't exposing it as a configurable option yet or it's handled internally without user control.

Now, looking at the possible categories: hypervisor, kernel, device, etc. KVM is part of the hypervisor layer in QEMU because it's responsible for managing virtual machines and their hardware interactions. The issue here is about how QEMU interacts with the host CPU's features via KVM, so it relates to the hypervisor component.

The user wants to control this quirk, which isn't currently configurable. That implies a feature request or bug related to configuration options in the hypervisor settings. Since the category includes 'hypervisor', that seems like the best fit.

I don't think it's about assembly lowering (assembly) because that's more about how code is translated. It's also not a performance issue unless explicitly mentioned, which it isn't here. The focus is on enabling or disabling a specific quirk in KVM, so hypervisor makes sense.
