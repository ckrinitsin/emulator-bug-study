Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this bug report. The user provided a detailed problem where their KVM VMs on top of VMware ESX are not booting when using virtio disk drives after an update to Proxmox. 

First, the issue is happening with QEMU-KVM version 2.7, and it's specifically related to virtio-based VMs not booting anymore. The user mentions that changing the disk from virtio0 to scsi0 works as a workaround for some distributions but not all. Also, downgrading QEMU-KVM to an older version fixes the issue.

Looking at the possible categories: hypervisor seems relevant because the problem is within KVM's functionality. The bug report is about VMs failing to boot when using virtio, which is a virtualization component handled by the hypervisor. Other options like 'device' or 'network' could be considered, but since it's specifically about booting and the hypervisor's handling of virtio, 'hypervisor' fits best.

I think the key here is that the issue is with how QEMU-KVM (the hypervisor) interacts with the virtio devices during the VM boot process. The BIOS shows attempting to boot from the harddisk, but it loops, indicating a problem in the virtual hardware setup or driver interaction under KVM. Since this behavior changed after an update and a known workaround is downgrading QEMU-KVM, it points towards a regression introduced in version 2.7.

So, the most appropriate category for this bug would be 'hypervisor' because it's directly related to how KVM manages virtual devices during VM booting.
