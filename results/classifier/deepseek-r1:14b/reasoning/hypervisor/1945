Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "More than 8 cores for RISC-V generic `virt` machine." The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is about having more than 8 cores on a RISC-V 'virt' machine. I'm not sure which category this falls into. Let me think: The virt machine in QEMU probably refers to the virtual machine configuration or a specific machine type. It's related to the number of CPUs (cores) allowed.

Looking at the categories, 'hypervisor' is one option because it relates to managing virtual machines and their resources like CPU cores. Alternatively, 'performance' could be considered since too many cores might affect performance, but that seems less likely. 'Kernel' or 'boot' don't seem directly related here. The issue isn't about device drivers, graphics, sockets, network, KVM specifics beyond the hypervisor aspect.

So, considering that the problem is about how the machine (hypervisor) allows more cores than intended, it's probably under 'hypervisor'.
