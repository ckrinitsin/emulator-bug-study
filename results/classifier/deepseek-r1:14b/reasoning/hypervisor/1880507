Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this bug report. So the issue is that the VMM on Ubuntu 20.04 isn't showing the memory consumption for Windows guests. From what I remember, KVM is a hypervisor used in QEMU for virtualization. The problem occurs when using different guest OSes—Windows and Ubuntu—and it's only an issue with Ubuntu 20.04 as the host.

Hmm, looking at the categories provided: there are several like 'mistranslation', 'assembly', 'other', etc., but I'm trying to find the most fitting one. The bug seems related to how resources are being monitored or reported by the hypervisor. Since it's about memory consumption not showing up for certain guests, maybe this is a performance issue? Or perhaps it's a problem with how the VMM interacts with the guests.

Wait, 'performance' might not be the exact fit here because it's more about resource monitoring rather than speed or efficiency. Alternatively, maybe it's a bug in the hypervisor itself. The categories include 'hypervisor', which sounds relevant since VMM is part of KVM, which is a hypervisor component.

So, considering that the issue is with memory reporting under the hypervisor, and that the problem occurs between specific host and guest OS combinations, I think the best fit would be under 'hypervisor'. That makes sense because it's related to how the hypervisor (KVM) manages or reports resources on the guests.
