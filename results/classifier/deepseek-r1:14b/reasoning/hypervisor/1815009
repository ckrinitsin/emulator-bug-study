Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU's EVDEV handling. The user is saying that when they have multiple guests and the host running, using lctrl + rctrl to switch between them doesn't work as intended. It only allows switching with the last started guest and the host, but previous guests can't be controlled.

First, I look at the possible categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is related to input devices (EVDEV) and how QEMU handles switching between guests. EVDEV in QEMU usually deals with passing through host's input devices to virtual machines. So this falls under device or peripherals. But I'm not entirely sure if it's a translation issue or a device handling problem.

Wait, the bug is about switching focus using keyboard shortcuts. That sounds more like an issue with how QEMU manages input events across multiple guests and the host. It might be related to how the hypervisor (QEMU/KVM) handles input redirection. So perhaps 'hypervisor' is the category because it's a management issue within the virtualization layer.

Alternatively, if it's about device handling, maybe 'peripherals' fits. But I think since it's about switching and control across multiple VMs, it's more about the hypervisor's management of input events rather than individual devices themselves.
