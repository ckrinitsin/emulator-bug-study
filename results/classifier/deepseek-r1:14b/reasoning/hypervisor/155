Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "MMX emulation is missing on HVF Acceleration". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly lowering, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, MMX refers to a set of CPU instructions used for multimedia processing. Emulation missing suggests that when running virtual machines using HVF (HVF is part of QEMU's KVM acceleration), these MMX instructions aren't being handled properly.

Looking at the categories: KVM and hypervisor are related since HVF is part of KVM in QEMU. The issue isn't about translation or assembly lowering; it's more about missing functionality in the virtualization layer. So, it's likely under hypervisor.
