Okay, so I need to classify the given bug report into one of the predefined categories. Let me read through the problem again.

The user mentioned that the kvm rbd driver and possibly others like qcow2, qed, etc., don't report the DISCARD-ZERO flag. They provided an example using lsblk -D, which shows all disks with a DISC-ZERO value of 0. The user expects this column to be at least 1 for RBD when discard is set to unmap because reading from discarded regions should return zeroes. This issue also affects QCOW2, QED, and sparse raw images. They suggest that KVM should copy the DISCARD-ZERO flag when a real SSD with discard capability is used as a virtual disk.

Hmm, so the bug is related to how KVM handles the DISCARD-ZERO flag in different storage formats like RBD, QCOW2, etc. The problem is about the correct handling of this specific flag, which affects how the hypervisor reports and behaves regarding discards.

Looking at the categories provided:

- Mistranslation: Incorrect mapping from source to target, but I'm not sure if this applies here.
- Assembly lowering: Probably not related.
- Other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The issue is directly about the KVM hypervisor's handling of a specific storage feature (DISCARD-ZERO flag). Since it's specifically mentioning KVM and its interaction with block devices, this seems to fall under the 'hypervisor' category. 

Wait, but let me double-check: The bug report is about how the KVM driver for RBD doesn't set the DISC-ZERO flag correctly. This affects storage behavior in virtual machines managed by KVM. Since it's related to the hypervisor's handling of block devices and their flags, 'hypervisor' is indeed the correct category.
