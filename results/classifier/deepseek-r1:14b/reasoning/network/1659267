Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The user is reporting an issue where they can't start a VM with the network cable unplugged. They mention that while using the monitor interface, they can use "set_link virtio-net-pci.0 off" to unplug the cable. However, there's no command-line option to do this when starting the VM. The user compares it to VirtualBox, which apparently allows this.

I need to figure out which category best fits this issue. Let's break down the problem. It's about network functionality in QEMU. Specifically, the ability to control or configure the network interface at startup. The missing feature is a command-line option to unplug the network cable before the VM starts.

Looking at the categories: device seems relevant because it's about hardware devices (network). Network is also directly related since it's about the network interface and its state. KVM isn't exactly right here unless it's hypervisor-related, but the issue is more about device configuration than the hypervisor itself.

The user wants an option to unplug the cable at VM startup, which relates to how devices are set up during boot. Since this is a feature request for network configuration on the command line, it falls under 'network' as that's the specific area affected.
