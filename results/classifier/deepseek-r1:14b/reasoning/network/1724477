Okay, so I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories. Let me read through it carefully.

The user is reporting that since version 2.9.0-rc0, the built-in websocket in QEMU isn't working anymore. They've tested several versions and found that all versions from master down to 2.8.x fail except for older ones like 2.7.1 and 2.6.2 which work.

Looking at the command line they used: `-vnc 0.0.0.0:8,websocket`. This is related to QEMU's VNC server, specifically using the websocket transport instead of regular TCP. So this is about how QEMU handles network connections for VNC.

Now, looking at the categories provided:

- There's 'network' which seems relevant because it's about connectivity and protocols.
- Other options like 'graphic' might also be considered since VNC relates to graphics, but in this case, it's specifically about the websocket protocol handling, not the graphical display itself.

The issue is that the websocket feature isn't working post-upgrade. It could relate to how QEMU handles network connections or the specific websocket implementation within the VNC server. Since the bug appears after a version change, it might be a regression in the networking code related to websockets.

So, considering all this, the most appropriate category seems to be 'network' because it's about communication protocols and connectivity via websockets.
