Okay, I need to classify this bug report related to QEMU. The user mentioned that QEMU hangs when starting with a bridged NIC. They tried both using the bridge and without it, and also used `-enable-kvm` but it didn't help. So the issue is specifically with the bridged network configuration.

Looking at the categories provided: device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, etc. The problem involves the network interface card (NIC), so "network" seems relevant. They were using a bridged NIC, which is a network configuration feature in QEMU. Since it's related to how the virtual machine connects to the network, the appropriate category should be "network".

I think other categories like "device" or "hypervisor" are broader but not as specific. The hang occurs during network setup, so "network" fits best.

The issue is with QEMU hanging when using a bridged NIC, which relates to network configuration. Therefore, the category is:

network
