Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "Unknown protocol 'ssh'". The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor. 

First, let's think about what the error message means. It says "Unknown protocol 'ssh'". SSH stands for Secure Shell, which is a network protocol used for secure remote login and other secure network services. So this has to do with networking.

Looking at the categories, I see 'network' as one of the options. That seems directly related because SSH operates over networks. 

Is there any possibility that it could be another category? Let's check. It's not about assembly or translation errors because the issue is about an unknown protocol, which relates to how something is handled in networking. It doesn't seem to be a device or graphic-related bug. Socket might also be related since SSH uses sockets, but socket is more about the endpoints for communication. However, the error mentions the protocol itself, so network seems broader and more accurate.

I don't think it's KVM, boot, VNC, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, or hypervisor because those areas don't directly involve protocols like SSH. So the most appropriate category is 'network'.
