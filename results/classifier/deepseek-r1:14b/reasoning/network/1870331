Alright, let's try to figure out the category for this bug report. The user is using QEMU and noticed that even when they supply a NIC configuration via a config file, an extra default NIC gets created. But if they also use "-nic none" or provide all items from the config as command-line arguments, only one NIC is created.

So, the issue seems to be related to how QEMU handles configurations, specifically when mixing command-line options and config files. The user expects that if a NIC is defined in the config file, no default should be added unless explicitly allowed. However, it's currently adding an extra one even when a config is provided.

Looking at the categories: device, graphic, socket, network... It seems to relate to network devices. Since the problem is about NICs (network interface cards) being created incorrectly, "network" would be the most appropriate category.
