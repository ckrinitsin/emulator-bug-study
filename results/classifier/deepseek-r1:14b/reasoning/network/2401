Alright, I need to classify this bug report: "-nic none" option has no equivalent in config file.

First, the user mentions that a specific command-line option doesn't have an equivalent in the configuration file. The option is related to networking, as "-nic" stands for network interface control.

Looking at the possible categories: network is one of them. Since this issue deals with how QEMU handles network interfaces and their configuration options, it fits under the 'network' category.
