Alright, I need to classify this bug report into one of the given categories: mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

The bug report is about "Raspberry 4B Ethernet support." The additional info mentions a patch for QEMU. Since it's related to Ethernet, which is a networking component, the category should be network.
