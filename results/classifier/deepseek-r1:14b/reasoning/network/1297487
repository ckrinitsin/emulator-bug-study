Alright, I need to classify this bug report for QEMU. The issue is about the MTU not being honored in virtio vnet. Let me break it down.

The user observed that after upgrading from Ubuntu 13.04 to 14.04, using KVM with VirtIO interfaces, large packets aren't being segmented correctly. Specifically, a 3481B packet isn't split into smaller segments when sent to the VM through vnet1, despite the MTU being set to 1500.

Looking at the ethtool output, in version 14.04, TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) is off for vnet1. This means that the host isn't handling the segmentation as it should. In 13.04, TSO was on, which worked fine without needing to disable anything.

This points towards a problem in how VirtIO handles MTU and packet segmentation. Since this relates to network traffic and VirtIO networking, it's likely an issue with how QEMU's VirtIO drivers are managing the network packets.

The categories provided include 'network' among others. The bug revolves around network interface behavior, particularly MTU handling and packet segmentation offloading in the network virtualization layer. Therefore, the most appropriate category here is 'network'.
