Okay, I need to classify this bug report: "qemu-bridge-helper undocumented and broken." The possible categories are mistranslation, assembly, other, device, graphic, socket, network, KVM, boot, vnc, debug, files, permissions, performance, kernel, peripherals, hypervisor.

First, the name of the tool is qemu-bridge-helper. I'm not exactly sure what it does, but from what I remember, QEMU has various helper tools for networking. The term "bridge" suggests it's related to network bridging, which allows VMs to connect to physical networks.

Looking at the categories: network seems relevant here because bridge typically involves handling network traffic between different interfaces. Since the bug report mentions that qemu-bridge-helper is undocumented and broken, it likely refers to issues with how networking is handled, possibly in terms of functionality or implementation.

Other categories like device might be a stretch unless it's a hardware device, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Graphic, socketâ€”those could relate, but bridge helper is more about network bridging than graphics or sockets specifically.

So, considering all this, I think "network" is the most appropriate category.
