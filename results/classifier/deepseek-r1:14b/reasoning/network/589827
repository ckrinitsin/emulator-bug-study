Alright, let's see what this bug report is about. The user is having an issue with QEMU related to the netdev tap type not using the specified ifname on a Linux host.

They tested it with versions 0.12.3, 0.12.4, and the latest git as of June 4, 2010. In their test case, they used the command:

qemu-system-x86_64 -hda disk.img -netdev tap,id=ids_e0 -device e1000,netdev=ids_e0

But instead of creating a tap interface named 'ids_e0', QEMU creates 'tap0'. They also tried using '-netdev type=tap' and still faced the same issue. Previously, they used an alternative approach with:

qemu-system-x86_64 -hda disk.img -net nic,model=e1000,vlan=99 -net tap,ifname=ids_e0,vlan=99 

Which worked as expected, creating 'ids_e0' and passing traffic.

The problem seems to be that when using the new netdev syntax with id, the ifname isn't being respected. Instead of using the specified name, QEMU defaults to something like 'tap0'. This affects network configuration, causing the interface not to exist as expected.

Looking at the categories provided: mistranslation, assembly lowering, and others like device, graphic, socket, etc. The issue is related to how network devices are handled in QEMU. Specifically, it's about the netdev tap type ignoring the specified ifname. 

The key here is that it's a networking-related bug because it involves the creation and naming of TAP interfaces, which are crucial for network connectivity in virtual machines. Therefore, the category that best fits this issue is 'network'.
