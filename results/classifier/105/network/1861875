VDE networking barely working 

Running qemu with a vde_switch and slirpvde:

  vde_switch -F -sock /tmp/qemu_vde_switch -M /tmp/qemu_vde_mgmt
  slirpvde -s /tmp/qemu_vde_switch -dhcp
  qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -smp 2 -serial mon:stdio -display none -vga none -nodefaults -accel hax -net nic,macaddr=52:54:00:0e:e0:61,model=virtio -net vde,sock=/tmp/qemu_vde_switch -device virtio-rng-pci -drive file=worker.qcow2,if=virtio -drive file=cloud-init.iso,format=raw,if=virtio

There is some network connectivity, ping and curl work, but bigger transfers like apt-get update break with the following errors printed in the output of vde_switch:

  vde_switch: send_sockaddr port 2: No buffer space available
  vde_switch: send_sockaddr port 2: No buffer space available
  vde_switch: send_sockaddr port 2: No buffer space available

I've tried to change the MTU size and model of the adapter inside of the VM, but nothing worked.

OS: macOS 10.15.2
qemu: 4.2.0
vde2 (vde_switch / slirpvde): 2.3.2

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
