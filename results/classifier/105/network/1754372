Set MIPS MSA in ELF Auxiliary Vectors

The MIPS MSA feature is currently not set in the ELF auxiliary vector.

That is, querying the AT_HWCAP key of the ELF auxiliary vectors for a MIPS CPU that has the MSA feature should return a value that has the second bit [0] set.

From [0], `HWCAP_MIPS_MSA` is defined to `1 << 1`.

Fix now in master as commit 46a1ee4f397ff and will be in 2.12.


Thanks !
