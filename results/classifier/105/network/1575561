config qemu virtio_queue_size to 1024，create vm boot from network failed

config qemu virtio_queue_size to 1024，create vm boot from network failed。
in the vm vncviewer，see the error log：
“ERROR queue size 1024 > 256
could  not open net0: no such file or directory"

the vm bios is seabios. see the seabios,it queue size config 256,can not change.


but vm by other boot type ,such as dev='hd', can use virtio_queue_size = 1024
