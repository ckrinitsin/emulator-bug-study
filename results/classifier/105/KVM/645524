No picture from USB webcam (kvm 0.13-rc1)

I export my Linux webcam to KVM using the switches "-usb -usbdevice host:046d:0929". The XP guest sees the webcam and the drivers install, but the camera only shows a black image. When I open the camera in Windows Explorer, it says "0 images" and a black image, while on a real XP, it says "1 image" and shows the video from the camera. Same problem with different webcams. Same cameras work fine on a native XP install.

Thanks for the report.

Can you tell me if it works with a Linux guest?

Can you tell me what kind of camera it is (e.g. the descriptors from lsusb -v for the device)?

Since there hasn't been any response to the question in comment #1, and version 0.13 is very outdated nowadays, I'm closing this ticket now. If you've still got USB problems with the very latest version of QEMU, please feel free to re-open this ticket again, or open a new ticket instead.
