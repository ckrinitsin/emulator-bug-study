High host CPU load and slower guest after upgrade guest OS Windows 10 to ver 1803

After upgrading Windows 10 guest to version 1803, guests VM runs slower and there is high host CPU load even when guest is almost idle. Did not happened with windows 10 up to version 1709.

See my 1st report here:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1033985/kvm-high-host-cpu-load-after-upgrading-vm-to-windows-10-1803

Another user report is here:

Tested on: Ubuntu 16.04 with qemu 2.5.0 and i3-3217U, Arch with qemu 2.12 i5-7200U, Ubuntu 18.04 qemu 2.11.1 AMD FX-4300. All three platform showing the same slowdown and higher host cpu load with windows 10 1803 VM compared to windows 10 1709 VM.

This bug affect me

I ran into similar issues with Windows 10 (1803), with regard to 2D graphics performance.

See my bug report here: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200877

Could you test with Spectre protection (temporarily) turned off inside the Windows VM?

hv_synic && hv_stimer only reduces the cpu from 40-50% to 4-5%.
still expecting under 1% like linux guests.

I found that C:\Program Files (x86)\SPICE Guest Tools\drivers\Balloon\w10\amd64/blnsvr.exe intensively requesting something in WMI-provider-host. And there are a lot of errors in event logs about it also.

Gannet, SPICE Guest Tools is certainly a different problem, you should report that to the spice project instead. And since the original problem was apparently fixed via hv_synic / hv_stimer (if I got the comments right), I'm closing this ticket now.
