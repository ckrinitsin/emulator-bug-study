windows xp clean install with spice-guest-tools-0.52.exe from
  http://spice-space.org/download/windows/spice-guest-tools/spice-guest-tools-0.52.exe

it comes very slow , and the Interrupts process got very high cpu usage(above 60%).
when i switch the net adapter from virtio to default(rtl8139) ,it works well.

spice-guest-tools-0.3 works well.
In spice-guest-tools-0.52 and 0.59, svchost.exe will use 50% cpu.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
