qemu fails to build on powerpc64

Qemu fails to build on powerpc64, ELFv1 ABI, since the introduction of the ELFv2 ABI support.  On FreeBSD/powerpc64 I see the following error building HEAD from today (8/14/2014):

Triaging old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU?

It looks like this has been fixed in the intervening 3 years.  I just tried building head on FreeBSD/powerpc64, and was successful.

OK, thanks for checking!
