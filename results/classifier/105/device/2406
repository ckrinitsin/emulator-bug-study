SDL UI on KMSDRM Frontend flips qemu-consoles
Description of problem:
If I launch qemu on the kms/drm console (without X11 or Wayland), the screen flips automatically between all qemu-consoles. The first (500?) milliseconds, there is the maschine output (boot messages), than the next (200?) milliseconds there is the monitor0 console, the next milliseconds, the serial0 console, and than the parallel0 console. And again from beginning (maschine, monitor0, serial0, parallel0, ... maschine, monitor0, serial0, parallel0, ...) - I dont press any key.

If I disable monitor0, serial0, parallel0, all is fine, except one thing: I cannot issue a command on monitor0, because its disabled ;).
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start qemu without X11 and without wayland on the KMSDRM console.
