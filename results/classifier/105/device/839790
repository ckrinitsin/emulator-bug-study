-usbdevice tablet broken on win XP client

I'm using the qemu-kvm package from arch (not the qemu package), and on prior versions of qemu-kvm I was able to use -usbdevide tablet without problems.  The absolute mouse position is great...  With current version of qemu-kvm, when I use -usbdevice tablet, I got no mouse at all.  As my client is windows XP, it's not good to try do anything without mouse, :-)

I searched in current bugs, and didn't find any bug which subject included "tablet", so I'm submitting this bug...

Current qemu-kvm package in arch I'm using is:

% pacman -Ss qemu-kvm
extra/qemu-kvm 0.15.0-2 [installed]
    Latest KVM QEMU is a generic and open source processor emulator which achieves a good emulation speed by using dynamic translation.

Please notice I do not get any error, just the mouse broken...

thanks,

Javier.

Forgot to mention, I'm using linux  3.0.4, but the problem also is present on all 3.0.* kernels:

% pacman -Ss linux | 'grep' core
...
core/linux 3.0.4-1 (base) [installed]

And the kvm module used is the intel one:

% lsmod | 'grep' kvm
kvm_intel              53373  3 
kvm                   328912  1 kvm_intel

If more information is needed, please let me know...

Also observed on Fedora 16: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=754149

Can you reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU from http://qemu-project.org/Download ?

According to the Fedora bug, this has been fixed. And since there wasn't any reply to the question in my last comment, I assume nobody experiences this issue anymore. So closing this ticket now...
