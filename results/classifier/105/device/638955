emulated netcards don't work with recent sunos kernel

hi there,

i'm using qemu-kvm backend in version: # qemu-kvm -version
QEMU PC emulator version 0.12.5 (qemu-kvm-0.12.5), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

and there are just *not working any of model=$type with combinations of recent sunos (solaris, openindiana, opensolaris, ..) ..

you can download for testing purposes iso from here: http://dlc-origin.openindiana.org/isos/147/ or from here: http://genunix.org/distributions/indiana/ << osol and oi are also bubuntu-like *live cds, so no need to bother with installing

behaviour is as follows:
e1000 - receiving doesn't work, transmitting works .. dladm (tool for handle ethers) shows that is all ok, correct mode is loaded up, it just seems like this driver works at 100% but ..

rtl8169|pcnet - works in 10Mbit mode with several other issues like high cpu utilization and so .. dladm is unable to recognize options for this kind of -nic

others - just don't work

.. i experienced this issue several times in past .. woraround was, that rtl8169 worked so-so .. with recent sunos kernel it doesn't.

it's easy to reproduce, this is why i'm not putting here more then launching script for my virtual machine:

# cat openindiana.sh
qemu-kvm -hda /home/kvm/openindiana/openindiana.img -m 2048 -localtime -cdrom /home/kvm/+images/oi-dev-147-x86.iso -boot d \
-vga std -vnc :9 -k en-us -monitor unix:/home/kvm/openindiana/instance,server,nowait \
-net nic,model=e1000,vlan=1 -net tap,ifname=oi0,script=no,vlan=1 &

sleep 2;
ip l set oi0 up;
ip a a 192.168.99.9/24 dev oi0;

regards by daniel

reproduced with latest vanilla qemu-kvm ..

i've just build it without any optimalizations like this: `./configure --prefix=$HOME/chroot/opt/qemu-kvm-0.13rc1; make`


(qemu) info version
info version
0.12.91 (qemu-kvm-0.13.0-rc1)

it acts just same .. i'm trying at first to hunt down what has happend in sunos kernel .. well, i hope that we'll be able to fix it as soon as possible because it's just very miserable that we're unable to use the best (in my opinion) virtualization platform ..

regards, daniel

added a output from `kstat -p e1000*` ..

call for more info if needed ..
regards by daniel

ps. summary: everything seems fine (link statistics and so) but receiving just doesn't work .. transmitting works

Hi,

This doesn't look right. AFAIK, MAC's dont pad on receive.

IMO this kind of padding should somehow be done by the bridge that forwards
packets into the qemu vlan (e.g slirp or the generic tap bridge).

Right, ethernet behaviour should obviously not be applied unconditionally for
all net devices.

I dont beleive that is possible. The FCS comes last, so an ethernet MAC
would have to do really silly things to differentiate between padding and
real payload.

Another way is to have network devices register their link types so that the
generic bridge can apply whatever link specific fixups that may be needed.

I would prefer to have the padding of bridged frames decoupled from the
device models, but I cant say I feel very strongly about this.

Cheers

well, feel free to request whichever information you could need or consider as a helpful ..

just for your information after ping via e1000 adapter i can see `arp -n` entry in target system and icmp packets are delivered ok. i'd like to presume that there is some little issue because e1000 driver is really just one taken from sunos kernel the best (althought that we've issue with receiving) .. all others work like trash (no statistic, no available modes, ..)

but as i said, i have *nothing indicating a problem in logs, i already put here a kernel statistic for this driver in attachment ..

Yes, but when using tap, the ethernet sender is QEMU itself. Tap doesn't
have the same requirements as ethernet so the original sender has no
reason to pad.

Internally in QEMU, there is code that picks up tap packets and
forwards them to the emulated ethernet links, this is were padding
should be done IMO. Not in the device models receive path.

The bridge that forwards frames from tap into emulated links must
also handle different kinds of link types, as all emulated network
devices are not necessarily ethernet.

Yes we should, I agree.

Daniel,
Does the following qemu.git patch solve the problem?
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/65137/raw/

Sorry about the partially mirrored mailing list thread.  I expected Launchpad to show the entire discussion but it seems to whitelist only registered users' emails.

Would this not also address the problem?  It sounds like the root cause 
is the tap code, not the devices..

This enforces ethernet semantics on the internal links (which is probably
not good), but it's IMO much better than changing the devices. It also
moves the workaround closer to the root of the problem. IMO, it's a step
in the right direction.

A small detail :)
40 -> 64 (including a dummy FCS).

That's actually a good point which strongly is in favor of making the 
devices do the padding themselves.

If we dont remove the padding from the device models rx paths, we
will continue with code that relies on it and it is IMO wrong.
Ethernet MAC's don't padd nor append checksum on receive.

I agree with you that it's not great that the internal link
protocol has to be strictly ethernet but it seems to me like
if that is reality today, with or without Anthonys patch.
slirp and tap both require ethernet semantics (except possibly
padding and FCS). The addressing and packet headers are ethernet.

In the long run, I'd rather see a more flexible internal interconnect
that supports mutiple heterogenous link types. In the meantime, I
think Anthonys patch is a better workaround than patching the
device models.

This won't work when s->has_vnet_hdr is 1 because the virtio-net
header consumes buffer space and reduces the amount we pad.  The
padding size should be 60 + (s->has_vnet_hdr ? sizeof(struct
virtio_net_hdr) : 0).

Adjusting the length without clearing the untouched buffer space is
probably fine.  I'm trying to think of a scenario where this becomes
an information leak (security issue).  Perhaps if the guest has vlans
enabled and allows different users to sniff traffic only on their
vlans?  Then you may be able to read part of another vlan's traffic by
sending short packets to your vlan and gathering the padding data.
This is pretty contrived but doing a <60 byte memset would prevent the
issue for sure.

And at the moment e1000 also has padding, both padding
and FCS appending should go away from ethernet models before
this goes in.

Anyway, if you guys maintaining the networking parts are in
agreement that padding and FCS appending should be done in
the device models (at least for the moment), I'll accept
that and back-off. In that case, I think your suggestion
of hiding things behind some kind of generic macro or
function would be good. At least it will clarify things.

well, i did some more investigations and here come a results ..

this patch http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/65137/raw/ solves problem partially .. NICs are working with that but after a deeper look, connection is lost when the netstack is flooded with higher traffic ..

i can connect with ssh|telnet from qemu-kvm host to sunos machines, but when i type dmesg for example (or anything else which does for a moment a higher traffic), the connection freezes ..

when i bind both tap ifaces under one bridge, access each machine via theirs /dev/console, conection to neighboring guest seems like works as expected, so this issue only affects connection between kvm host and guests ..

sorry for my very plain description of problem, but it's again easy to reproduce ..

so once more in short:

two machines with following settings:
-net nic,model=e1000,macaddr="00:50:56:ba:5e:74",vlan=1 \
-net tap,ifname=oi0,script=no,vlan=1 & ## openindiana

-net nic,model=e1000,macaddr="00:50:56:ba:6e:74",vlan=1 \
-net tap,ifname=solaris0,script=no,vlan=1 & ## solaris

1) ping over directly assigned address on oi0|solaris0 works, connection is lost when invoked higher trafic aka - ssh|telnet in there and then typed dmesg command or whatever else which floods /dev/stdin and invokes due to the that higher traffic

2) when created bridge (brctl addbr br0; brctl addif br0 oi0 solaris0) and assigned address it behaves same way with exception, that when used /dev/console on each of them for connection to second machine, netstack seems like working there okay ..

I haven't looked more into this but noticed an e1000 patch from
Anthony Perard which may improve the Solaris experience:

I believe no one has investigated this issue since my last comment.
Someone with time and interest in Solaris needs to step up to debug
this problem.

DTrace inside the guest and QEMU tracing (see docs/tracing.txt) are
good tools for figuring out what is going on in the Solaris device
driver and QEMU's hardware emulation, respectively.

If you know a previous QEMU version where a network device works under
Solaris you could use git-bisect(1) to find the commit that broke
Solaris.  From what you've said though, it seems the issue is with new
Solaris kernels rather than changes in QEMU.

Stefan

okay Stefan ..

thanks, i poked several people and trying to learn up how netstack works .. i have no experience with programming drivers .. i hope that we'll fix it soon cuz it's very bad that we're unable to use kvm|qemu

Hi Daniel,

I just tried a newer version of the indiana iso image
(http://dlc-origin.openindiana.org/isos/148/oi-dev-148-x86.iso) with
latest qemu (not qemu-kvm) on a debian amd64 linux host, and I had no problems
with networking (ssh from qemu's emulated indiana host to physical linux host).

Tested with e1000 and i82559c, both work.

Does the error only occur with the older iso image?
Or is it caused by qemu-kvm?

Regards,
Stefan

I can confirm this. Just spent hours studying my network configuration in OpenIndiana b148 running in Qemu KVM and figuring out what's wrong... Everything's OK, network is up but I won't even ping the gateway.
Please fix this soon!


Hi all,
I can confirm this bug,
on latest openindiana-148 and qemu-kvm 0.13.0 you cannot even ping the virtualization host.
With qemu-kvm-0.14.0 (just released!) you CAN ping the host: this is already an improvement.
HOWEVER 
biggest bug is still there: if you log in to the openindiana machine via ssh and do "dmesg" or "netstat" or some other command which ouptuts a lot of text, the tcp socket will hang (well say it hangs once every 3 attempts) forever.

Going with tcpdump -e from within the guest, I have identified that the problem is when a big enough packet is outputed.
I tried a few times with dmesg, and as soon as the tcp packet reaches the following length:

18:38:28.340097 52:54:69:b5:89:11 (oui Unknown) > 00:19:b9:81:2c:52 (oui Unknown), ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 1514: 192.168.7.38.ssh > 192.168.7.52.59008: Flags [.], ack 2824, win 64436, options [nop,nop,TS val 27488132 ecr 6063255], length 1448

it cannot get through. Then the IP stack tries and retries to send the same identical packet, but there will never be any reply from the other side. Finally the socket is torn down.

I have bridged networking for the VM. My bridge is a normal linux bridge br0 with MTU 1500.
Has MTU anything to do with all this?
Is it a linux-bridge bug or a qemu-kvm bug?

Please fix this, solaris is important for its ZFS.
Thank you

Excellent, thanks for posting these details.  The bug is probably in
the NIC hardware emulation and I think we can track this one down
fairly easily.

Can you please post your qemu-kvm command-line including the NIC model
that you are using?

Stefan


Emulated NIC is e1000.

I found out that if one reduces the MTU on the client like "ifconfig eth0 mtu 300" it seems ssh hangs much more rarely (but still hangs, at 300).
Reducing it on the virtualization host bridge is not enough though (unless you are initiating ssh from the virtualization host itself)
To trigger the hang, do:
while true ; do dmesg ; done
The higher the allowed MTU, the quicker the hang, e.g. MTU 500 hangs within one minute. 1500 hangs instantly.

I'm available to try patches for a while if somebody can spot the problem... the host is still not in production.

Thanks for your work

I was able to reproduce this problem with qemu.git running OpenIndiana 148 with tap and bridge on the host.  I did not see an issue with the userspace network stack - seems to manifest itself as a checksum error in transmitted packets.

Here is the host tcpdump during a TCP stall with mtu 1500:

Everything went fine up to here but now the stall shows up...

Notice that only seq up to 8069 was acked by the host and this is a duplicate ack.  I think it's prodding the guest to transmit from 8069 again.

Resends and more duplicate acks up to 8069.  The host is not responding to the guest transmitted packets.  Wireshark shows checksum errors for guest transmitted frames when the stall occurs.

I added instrumentation to hw/e1000.c and get the following information about transmitted frames:

Perhaps there is a e1000 emulation bug here that causes us to miss the sum_needed bits and an invalid checksum ends up being transmitted.  Need to investigate this more.

Here is the patch in case you want to confirm my results so far:
http://repo.or.cz/w/qemu/stefanha.git/commitdiff/fa963c73b254af2e43a9a45ff5cceb2c42519f55

Please test this patch:
http://repo.or.cz/w/qemu/stefanha.git/commitdiff/c405d1b66e045bce1c53a30f9ad840c6f19eca57

QEMU loads checksum offload flags from every tx data descriptor.  When a
multi-descriptor packet is sent, Solaris will only mark the first
descriptor with checksum offload flags.  Therefore QEMU fails to perform
checksum offload resulting in corrupted packets that will be discarded
by the receiver.

I'll try to come up with a proper fix that can be submitted to QEMU.

The PCI/PCI-X Family of Gigabit Ethernet Controllers Software
Developer’s Manual states the following about the POPTS field:

  Provides a number of options which control the handling of this
  packet.  This field is ignored except on the first data descriptor of
  a packet.

The current implementation always loads the field and its checksum
offload flags.  This patch uses only the first descriptor's POPTS field
in order to comply with the specification.

When Solaris sends multi-descriptor packets it fills in POPTS for the
first descriptor only.  Therefore this patch is necessary in order to
perform checksum offload correctly for multi-descriptor packets.

Stefan, thanks for your work.

I tested your patch in comment #29 and it does seem to solve the problem for me for latest openindiana and also for latest nexenta core. 

Also I checked vanilla rtl8139 and it seems to work for openindiana on qemu-kvm-0.14.0 (with 0.13.0 I think I had problems).

Thanks for putting me as reported-by on the patch, but that's not my real name or address I'd like to be on the patch... actually I thought I had set launchpad to keep me anonymous and keep email address hidden (where's that option now...) 

I have just sent an email at your linux.vnet address with real data. If you can, please use that during official submission of the patch. Thank you.

The PCI/PCI-X Family of Gigabit Ethernet Controllers Software
Developer’s Manual states the following about the POPTS field:

  Provides a number of options which control the handling of this
  packet.  This field is ignored except on the first data descriptor of
  a packet.

The current implementation always loads the field and its checksum
offload flags.  This patch uses only the first descriptor's POPTS field
in order to comply with the specification.

When Solaris sends multi-descriptor packets it fills in POPTS for the
first descriptor only.  Therefore this patch is necessary in order to
perform checksum offload correctly for multi-descriptor packets.

I have this problem (as describe in OP) on a Solaris 11.2 install using the text iso.  Archlinux Qemu 2.1.0.  It appears that the above patch has been applied to qemu for some time now (its also in my version).

Are there any new workarounds?

Hi,
It's been a long time since that fix was developed.

At this point it would be necessary to debug the problem from scratch.
I don't have time to work on this in the near future, sorry.

Maybe someone else wants to figure out what is wrong.

Stefan


apparently it has something to do with x2apic.  simply refining my cpu line to be -cpu kvm64,-x2apic leads to a working network.

See also bug #1395217

See the following bug report for a working Solaris 10 KVM guest configuration:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1262093

Based on comment #30, it sounds like the original problem of this bug has been fixed, and since the remaining apic-related problem is tracked in ticket #1395217 already, I think we can close this bug now (if you don't agree, feel free to open this ticket again).
