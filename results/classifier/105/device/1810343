qemu-nbd -l and -s options don't work together

When using qemu-nbd with -l to load a snapshot along with -s to create new active layer the tool fails to find the snapshot specified on the command line:

For example the following does not work:
  sudo qemu-nbd -s --load-snapshot=files  --connect /dev/nbd0 rootfs.qcow2                                   
  Failed to load snapshot: Can't find snapshot

However, the following option works
  sudo qemu-nbd -s --connect /dev/nbd0 rootfs.qcow2
and so does
  sudo qemu-nbd --load-snapshot=files  --connect /dev/nbd0 rootfs.qcow2


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
