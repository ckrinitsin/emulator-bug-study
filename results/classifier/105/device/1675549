Hi,
today i try to test qemu 2.9rc 1 with qemu-system-i386 if i set display as sdl and i push a key on keyboard qemu exit with an error 

translate-common.c:34:tcg_handle_interrupt: assertion failed: (qemu_mutex_iothread_locked())

This issue was not present on qemu 2.8.0 

Test Machine PowerMac G5 Quad Fedora 25 Server PPC64
Qemu build with target-list=i386-softmuu --with-sdlabi=2.0 

Ciao 
Luigi
