QEMU Zaurus cannot boot 2.4.x kernels

I tried akita and spitz machines.
4.x, 3.x and 2.6.x kernels boot OK, but when I try to pass any 2.4.x, qemu crashes with "Trying to execute code outside RAM or ROM at 0x00800000".

Thanks for the bug report. Unfortunately the akita and spitz models are pretty much unmaintained these days, so if this is important to you you'll need to investigate the cause of the problem yourself, especially given that more recent kernels work.
