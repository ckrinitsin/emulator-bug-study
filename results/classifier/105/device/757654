UHCI fails to signal stall response

When TD execution results in STALL error (STALL handshake, no stall as a result of err count reaching 0), there is no way to know about it except for checking that TD. IMO it is an error condition and it should be reflected in the status register (and issue an interrupt if enabled).

Ways to replicate:
Send a query that is answered by stall (like set_idle request to a mouse)

Expected behavior:
UHCI hc sets status bit 1 (usb error interrupt) and issues an interrupt

current behavior:
Neither status bit is set nor interrupt triggered

Version 0.14
attached patch for current master (quick fix, it might be I got something wrong)



Hi,

Thanks for reporting this issue.

Just so you are aware: the qemu USB maintainer is probably going to be away for a while longer, so don't be too worried if this patch doesn't get looked at for 2-4 weeks.

No problem, it's not like it breaks something. This fix just makes driver development easier.

Please send your patch to the mailing list:

It may seem petty to ask this since you've already attached it to the
bug, but for QEMU development to scale and keep at a rapid pace,
everyone needs to follow these steps on submitting patches.  Thanks
for your effort!
