virtio-net ignores the absence of the VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_VQ feature bit

When negotiating virtio-net feature bits, the device ignores the absence of the VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_VQ bit in driver feature bits and provides three virtqueues, including the control virtqueue, even though the driver is expecting only the receive and transmit virtqueues. Looking into the source code, it appears it always assumes the presence of the control virtqueue, violating thus the VIRTIO version 1.0 specification.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
