assert failed in scsi-bus.c line 1539 in SCSI_XFER_NONE

Every time I format a SCSI hard disk (on ID 0) with Windows NT or DOS, QEMU crashes with an assertion failure on scsi-bus.c, any help?

this happens from 1.3.0 to the latest git release.

Does this problem still occur with the latest version of QEMU (currently it's 2.7.0)? If so, can you please post the exact assertion message, and if possible a stack trace (taken with gdb)? Thanks!
