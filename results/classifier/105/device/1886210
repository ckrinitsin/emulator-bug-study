[Feature request] Illumnos VM image

We already have handy VMs to build QEMU within:

$ git grep -l basevm.BaseVM
tests/vm/centos
tests/vm/fedora
tests/vm/freebsd
tests/vm/netbsd
tests/vm/openbsd
tests/vm/ubuntu.i386

It would be useful to have a illumos VM to do build testing and avoid regressions.

This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'invalid' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
