Unable to remotely debug with gdbserver on debian while using qemu-system-m68k emulator
Description of problem:
When I use gdb-multiarch to try to connect to the gdbserver running on the guest machine the error message below is displayed by the gdbserver:

```
/build/gdb-Lhte76/gdb-13.2/gdbserver/tdesc.cc:195: A problem internal to GDBserver has been detected.
tdesc_get_features_xml: Assertion `tdesc->xmltarget != NULL || (!tdesc->features.empty () && tdesc->arch != NULL)' failed.
```

and the program execution is terminated abruptly.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download the Debian Motorola 680x0 Port and install it using QEmu.
2. Update to unstable version (optional).
3. Download and install gdbserver and also a compiler for the C language.
4. Write a hello world and compile.
5. Run gdbserver targeting the program from the previous step.
6. Try connecting using gdb-multiarch.
Additional information:
The error persists when I download the QEmu source code and compile it.

If this procedure is done with an older version of gdbserver (such as 7.12) then I can connect normally. However, if a breakpoint is placed anywhere in the program and if it is reached at any point during execution and if after it is reached the 'continue' command is entered, then the error message below is displayed by the gdbserver:

```
linux-low.c:2627: A problem internal to GDBserver has been detected.
int maybe_hw_step(thread_info*): Assertion `has_reinsert_breakpoints (thread)' failed.
```

and the program execution is terminated abruptly.

I think it's working on real hardware.
