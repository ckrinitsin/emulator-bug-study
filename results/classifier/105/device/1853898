qemu/hw/scsi/lsi53c895a.c:417: lsi_soft_reset: Assertion `QTAILQ_EMPTY(&s->queue)' failed.

While experimenting with blkdebug I can consistently hit this assertion in lsi53c895a.c.

Using locally built from master, commit: 2061735ff09f9d5e67c501a96227b470e7de69b1

Steps to reproduce

$ qemu-img create -f raw empty.raw 8G
$ sudo losetup -f --show empty.raw
$ sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/loop0
$ sudo losetup -D

$ cat blkdebug.conf 
[inject-error]
event = "read_aio"
errno = "5"

$ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 2048 -cpu host -smp 4 -nic user,ipv6=off,model=e1000,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,net=172.16.0.0/255.255.255.0 -device lsi53c895a,id=scsi -device scsi-hd,drive=hd,wwn=12345678 -drive if=scsi,id=hd,file=blkdebug:blkdebug.conf:empty.raw,cache=none,format=raw -cdrom Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-31-1.9.iso -display gtk

Initiate install from cdrom ISO image results in:

qemu-system-x86_64: /builddir/build/BUILD/qemu-3.1.1/hw/scsi/lsi53c895a.c:381: lsi_soft_reset: Assertion `QTAILQ_EMPTY(&s->queue)' failed.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
