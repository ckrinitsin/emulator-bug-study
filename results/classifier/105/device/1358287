-readconfig file doesn't interpret memory size correctly

I'm running Qemu 2.1 and have issues with the config file format.

Specifically Qemu wrote the following snippet with '-writeconfig':

[memory]
  size = "1024"

However, upon starting a VM with this setting it only receives 128MiB (the default size).

I'm reverting back to using the command line option now - that works.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Good question. Over time I've got some feedback that the whole config file mechanism is really just a second class citizen anyway. I'm happy for now (running 2.7) and don't really care too much.

Nevertheless: I'd be absolutely excited if I could reliably configure (and have nice documentation that I'd even be willing to help create) Qemu instances just with a config file ... 

Feel free to close this issue to get rid of old cruft ... :)
