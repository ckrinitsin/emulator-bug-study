sgabios outputs incorrect video modes

When run with a bootstrap loader that uses int 0x10 with 0x1301 in %ax, incorrect video modes are output to the serial port.  I believe the VGA image will be correct.  This might also affect the returned values for some interrupts.

This is caused because the set_cursor_position routine fails to save and restore %bx.

I'm working on a fix for this.

I think I have submitted the fix to the qemu development list, but have no way to be sure it made it past Stratus' corporate firewall.  If it didn't make it (or if that was the wrong place to send it), please let me know.

TIA

I don't think my e-mailed patch got through...  I'm going to keep trying, but in case anyone needs the patch in the interim...

The attachment "0001-SGABIOS-fix-wrong-video-attrs-for-int-10h-ah-13h.patch" seems to be a patch.  If it isn't, please remove the "patch" flag from the attachment, remove the "patch" tag, and if you are a member of the ~ubuntu-reviewers, unsubscribe the team.

That patch is wrong.  The correct patch has been submitted and checked on the QEMU mailing lists

(http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/737446/).

Any chance of getting this patch included?
I've deleted the incorrect patch and attached the correct one (taken from QEMU's sgabios repo).

Status changed to 'Confirmed' because the bug affects multiple users.

Looks like the fix has been included in QEMU's sgabios repository here:

 https://git.qemu.org/?p=sgabios.git;a=commitdiff;h=cbaee52287e5f32373181cf

And the binary in the QEMU repository has been updated here:

 https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=c8c33fca88fc3ab8a5e4b

So this fix is included in QEMU since version 2.10.


Fixed in qemu, yes. But not Ubuntu. Ubuntu strips prebuilt files from qemu and builds them from source. For sgabios, using the abandoned source from Google code.

I believe QEMU has handed ownership of this off to coreboot.  Which makes sense.
