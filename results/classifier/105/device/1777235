NVME is missing support for Get Log Page command

"Get Log Page" is a mandatory admin command by the specification (NVMe 1.2, Section 5, Figure 40) currently not implemented by device.

I have a patch for that, it was designed to run NVMe for MacOS guests and implements at least the bare minimum of the spec. I'll try to polish it up and upstream it as soon as I have time.
