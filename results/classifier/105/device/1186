qos-test fails when built with LTO and gcc-12
Description of problem:
The issue is already discussed here [1]. I'm simply building latest QEMU release and running the test suite. I thought the issue was fixed in 7.0 but it has resurfaced. Do QEMU dev's not build with LTO? I'm not able to debug this but I can test any proposed fixes etc. Thanks.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Build QEMU with gcc-12 and LTO enabled
2. Run make check
3. Observe test suite failures in qos-test
