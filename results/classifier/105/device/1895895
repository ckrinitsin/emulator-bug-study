Attaching SD-Card to specific SD-Bus Sabrelite (ARM)

Currently, I am looking for a method of attaching an sd-card to a specific bus as opposed to defaulting to the first. 

QEMU Version: 5.0.0
Specifically trying to use qemu-system-arm binary


Running an "info qtree" shows the output seen in the attached image. I have attempted multiple different combinations of arguments to attempt to get the sd-card to appear on the FOURTH sd-bus but no luck. The machine type being used is Sabrelite. It should be noted that I was able to PATCH QEMU to achieve the result I expected but I had hoped this functionality was already available and did not require modification to QEMU itself.


For reference, this is the patch that was made to source to allow the card to attach to a specific bus. After the change was made, an sd-card could be attached to a bus with the following flags:

-drive file=sdcard.img,format=raw,id=mycard -device sd-card,drive=mycard,bus=sd-bus.0


diff qemu-5.1.0.orig/hw/sd/sdhci.c qemu-5.1.0/hw/sd/sdhci.c
1311a1312,1314
>     static int index=0;
>     char name[64];
>     sprintf(name, "sd-bus.%d", index++);
1313c1316
<                         TYPE_SDHCI_BUS, DEVICE(s), "sd-bus");
---
>                         TYPE_SDHCI_BUS, DEVICE(s), name);



If there is a way to attach an sd-card to the specific bus that does NOT require this change, I'd appreciate it.



The fsl-imx* SoC devices need to create aliases onto the sd-buses with unique names; see discussion here:
