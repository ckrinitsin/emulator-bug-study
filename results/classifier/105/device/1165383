executable qemu-1.4.0/i386-linux-user/./qemu-i386 gives a segmentation fault

executable qemu-1.4.0/i386-linux-user/./qemu-i386 gives a segmentation fault

Can you please provide some more information here.

e.g.

    - qemu command-line used
    -  how did you trigger it - libvirt/or direct qemu-kvm binary
    - segentation fault/tracedetails


I'm going to close this bug, since there was no response to the 2013 request for more detail. If you're still having problems with QEMU, please open a fresh bug report.
