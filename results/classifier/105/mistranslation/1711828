lock mov non generated #UD

qemu 2.8.1 debian 9.1

Could you please add a proper description to this bug? Please also try first whether your problem also occurs with the latest released version of QEMU (version 2.9 or the 2.10 release candidate), to see whether it has been fixed there already.



sorry i english poor：


intel manual say：
The LOCK prefix can be prepended only to the following instructions and only to those forms of the instructions
where the destination operand is a memory operand: ADD, ADC, AND, BTC, BTR, BTS, CMPXCHG, CMPXCH8B,
CMPXCHG16B, DEC, INC, NEG, NOT, OR, SBB, SUB, XOR, XADD, and XCHG. If the LOCK prefix is used with one of
these instructions and the source operand is a memory operand, an undefined opcode exception (#UD) may be
generated. An undefined opcode exception will also be generated if the LOCK prefix is used with any instruction not
in the above list. The XCHG instruction always asserts the LOCK# signal regardless of the presence or absence of
the LOCK prefix.


but qemu NO!
lock mov   forms of the instructions non generated #UD exception!
my OS : debian 9.1 
QEMU: qemu 2.8.1
