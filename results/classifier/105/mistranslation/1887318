This is a Cat & Mouse game...
Catch 22...

its Not a Brew problemm
is Not a glib problem,
is not a git problem,

its an Apple problem,
Apple does Not care.

End of Story.

QEMU only supports the two most recent versions of macOS (see https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/build-platforms.html). Support for older versions has been removed (see https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=483644c25b93236001), so if you still want to use QEMU on such an old system, you better use an older version of QEMU instead.

This is why we need installer files for QEMU. They make life so much  
easier than building from source.
