[REQUEST] SHARING MEMORY WITH HOST

Instead of a preallocated memory heap I would like for QEMU to share memory using shm. 

Example: Instead of using 16gb out of 32gb of ram to run Windows 10, there would be no option to allocate it, but to share the hosts resources; ie giving the host full access to the entire ram stack


I'm not a great programmer but I'm pretty sure QEMU's team could find this useful

Sorry, but I have a hard to to imagine what you exactly mean here. Do you mean a possibility for one application in the guest and one in the host to share a piece of memory? Or do you mean that the operating systems in the host and guest should somehow share the memory (why?)? Or do you just look for a possibility to avoid that the guest has a lot of memory allocated to it when it does not need it? In the latter case, there is already virtio-balloon, so you should have a look at the virtio drivers if you need something like this.
