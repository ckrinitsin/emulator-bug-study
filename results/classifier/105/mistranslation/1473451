Please support the native bios format for dec alpha

Currently qemu-system-alpha -bios parameter takes an ELF image.
However HP maintains firmware updates for those systems.

Some example rom files can be found here ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/alphaserver/firmware/current_platforms/v7.3_release/DS20_DS20e/

It might allow things like using the SRM firmware.
The ARC(nt) firmware would allow to build and test windows applications for that platforms without having the relevant hardware

QEMU does not really implement a "true" ev67.

We cheat and implement something that is significantly faster to emulate.
E.g. doing all TLB refill within qemu, rather than in the PALcode.

So, no, there's no chance of running true SRM or ARC firmware.

But In that case itâ€™s impossible to emulate or even compile Windows for Dec Alpha.
