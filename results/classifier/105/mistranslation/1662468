[feature request] qemu-img convert should respond to control-T like dd

Since qemu-img convert is a long-running operation, it would be nice if it reported progress in response to control-T (SIGINFO) to show progress information, much like dd, fsck, dump, cp, etc.

That should be simple enough to implement considering we have this behavior already on SIGUSR1. Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to test it because Linux apparently doesn't implement SIGINFO...

PS: By the way, thanks for the information. I didn't know about SIGINFO at all. Well, now I have mapped Ctrl-T to SIGUSR1 in my terminal emulator so I don't have to feel quite as inferior...

By that you may have lost the following Readline action:

       transpose-chars (C-t)
              Drag the character before point forward over the charac-
              ter at point, moving point forward as well.  If point is
              at  the  end  of  the line, then this transposes the two
              characters before point.   Negative  arguments  have  no
              effect.

I'm sure you've been using that all the time... ;)

Christophe: In case you hadn't seen what Max is referring to on the
qemu-img man page:

  -p  display progress bar (compare, convert and rebase commands
      only).  If the -p option is not used for a command that supports
      it, the progress is reported when the process receives a
      "SIGUSR1" signal.

Does this do what you want?


Fix has been included in v2.10.0:
