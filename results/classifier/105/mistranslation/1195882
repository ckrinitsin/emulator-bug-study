Exact same error for 1.5.1 build 
So, qemu not supported on anything but Ubuntu?

autoreconf is part of the autoconf package. Do you have that installed?

As  far as I know,  autoreconf does not exist in the red hat/fedora/centos world.  

Can't find a yum, rpm. or other distro for it on the above os. 

Am I missing something obvious hrte? 

Thanks....

You aren't looking very  hard; on my RHEL 6.4 box (which has the same
packages as what you can install in CentOS), I see:

$ rpm -qf `which autoreconf`
autoconf-2.63-5.1.el6.noarch

Hi, 

Thanks for the response. 

You're right, it was the lack of autoconf.  Actually, on CentOS/RH,  you need 
to check for 

autoconf
automake (includes autoconf?)
libtools 

Seems to be building happily now.   Sorry for the newbie question. 

/T.

You're right.    Also installed automake which supplies an 'aclocal' 
executable that's not in the autoconf distro, and libtool to fix a 'possibly 
undefined macro AC_LIBTOOL' issue. 

Seems to be happily compiling/linking now.

My apologies for the pseudo-bug report.  

BTW, thank you for your assistance.
