User-mode QEMU is not deterministic

QEMU in user-mode (linux-user or bsd-user) has no way to get the equivalent of the "-icount" argument found in softmmu mode.

It is true that some system calls in user-mode can prevent deterministic execution, but it would be very simple to patch time-related syscalls to return a number based on icount when in deterministic mode.

Putting both changes together (icount + time-related syscalls) would cover the needs for deterministic execution of most benchmarks (i.e., those not interacting with the network or other programs in the system).

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
