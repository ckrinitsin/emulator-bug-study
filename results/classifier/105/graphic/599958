Timedrift problems with Win7: hpet missing time drift fixups

We've been finding timedrift issues witth Win7 under qemu-kvm on our daily testing

kvm.qemu-kvm-git.smp2.Win7.64.timedrift.with_load	FAIL	1	Time drift too large after rest period: 38.63%
kvm.qemu-kvm-git.smp2.Win7.64.timedrift.with_reboot	FAIL	1	Time drift too large at iteration 1: 17.77 seconds
kvm.qemu-kvm-git.smp2.Win7.64.timedrift.with_migration	FAIL	1	Time drift too large at iteration 2: 3.08 seconds

Steps to reproduce:

timedrift.with_load

1) Log into a guest.
2) Take a time reading from the guest and host.
3) Run load on the guest and host.
4) Take a second time reading.
5) Stop the load and rest for a while.
6) Take a third time reading.
7) If the drift immediately after load is higher than a user-
    specified value (in %), fail.
    If the drift after the rest period is higher than a user-specified value,
    fail.

timedrift.with_migration

1) Log into a guest.
2) Take a time reading from the guest and host.
3) Migrate the guest.
4) Take a second time reading.
5) If the drift (in seconds) is higher than a user specified value, fail.

timedrift.with_reboot

1) Log into a guest.
2) Take a time reading from the guest and host.
3) Reboot the guest.
4) Take a second time reading.
5) If the drift (in seconds) is higher than a user specified value, fail.

This bug is to register those issues and keep an eye on them.

Does adding -no-hpet make a difference?  I assume that Win7 is using hpet by default and we currently don't do any time drift mitigation with hpet.

I will try that on a separate test job and will let you know about the results.

Indeed -no-hpet made the tests pass. It's still uncertain to me whether this flag is supported across several branches of qemu-kvm, if it's supported in all branches I'm going to update the upstream kvm autotest config file.

-no-hpet works in every version of qemu/qemu-kvm that has included HPET support.  RHEL disables HPET support by default unlike qemu and qemu-kvm.

I've updated the bug priority and title to reflect what the issue is.

We only support edge triggered interrupts with HPET which seems to be what most OSes use anyway.  We could potentially use the reset_irq_delivered/get_irq_delivered APIC functions to implement interrupt catch-up but I think it would be better to try to merge Jan's generic IRQ delivered API first.

Sent patch http://patchwork.test.kernel.org/patch/2384/ to autotest and will update the autotest server to reflect that option.

Apparently this bug's still alive and kicking.

There's an obvious clock skew problem on Windows 7; in the Date & Time dialog, the clock jumps through seconds visibly too fast.

I also found a case where HPET bugs are causing a real problem: Terraria (dedicated server) seems to be relying on (something that relies on) HPET, and QEMU doesn't get it right. The result is a goofy and aggravating behavior I've nicknamed "Turbo Monsters of Doom" and it makes killing anything tougher than a normal zombie basically impossible.

Forgot to add: Reproduced the above behavior in both 1.5.1 and 1.6.0. Adding -no-hpet to commandline removed both problems (full disclosure: this fix wasn't tested in 1.5.1 but I have no reason to believe behavior would be different.)

Fair enough in itself, but if HPET is known to have problems with
arguably the most popular OS family to use as a guest, why is it
enabled by default?

Agh, I forgot reply all.

Seems like something that should be changed, no? It would've saved me
a lot of headache if there was a switch e.g.
-optimize-for=[linux,winxp,
win7,etc] that changed the defaults to be
most accomodating to the specified OS as a guest.

I google about an old link talk about this issue can be fixed by not using virtio

http://forum.proxmox.com/archive/index.php/t-5783.html

Looking through old bug tickets... can this issue still be reproduced with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?


Absolutely, please close it.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
