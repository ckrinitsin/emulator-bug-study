qemu-system-x86_64: warning: no scancode found for keysym 65483
Description of problem:
qemu-system-x86_64: warning: no scancode found for keysym 65483

I'm hoping this is something that could easily be added to qemu, rather than a limitation of windows:

I want to bind F14 to an arbitrary key, in this case `keycode 148 = XF86Calculator`, but it's not happening, and qemu is giving the error: `qemu-system-x86_64: warning: no scancode found for keysym 65483`

`xmodmap -e "keycode 148 = F14 F14 F14 F14 F14"` Executes with no error, and xev correctly shows as F14 pressed/released, but a windows 10 VM started afterwards cannot recognise this bind.
