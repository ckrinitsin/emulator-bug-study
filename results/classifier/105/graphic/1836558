Qemu-ppc Memory leak creating threads

When creating c++ threads (with c++ std::thread), the resulting binary has memory leaks when running with qemu-ppc.

Eg the following c++ program, when compiled with gcc, consumes more and more memory while running at qemu-ppc. (does not have memory leaks when compiling for Intel, when running same binary on real powerpc CPU hardware also no memory leaks).

(Note I used function getCurrentRSS to show available memory, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/669438/how-to-get-memory-usage-at-runtime-using-c; calls commented out here)

Compiler: powerpc-linux-gnu-g++ (Debian 8.3.0-2) 8.3.0 (but same problem with older g++ compilers even 4.9)
Os: Debian 10.0 ( Buster) (but same problem seen on Debian 9/stetch)
qemu: qemu-ppc version 3.1.50

#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>


using namespace std::chrono_literals;

// Create/run and join a 100 threads.
void Fun100()
{
//    auto b4 = getCurrentRSS();
//    std::cout << getCurrentRSS() << std::endl;
    for(int n = 0; n < 100; n++)
    {
        std::thread t([]
        {
            std::this_thread::sleep_for( 10ms );
        });
//        std::cout << n << ' ' << getCurrentRSS() << std::endl;
        t.join();
    }
    std::this_thread::sleep_for( 500ms ); // to give OS some time to wipe memory...
//    auto after = getCurrentRSS();
    std::cout << b4 << ' ' << after << std::endl;
}


int main(int, char **)
{
    Fun100();
    Fun100();  // memory used keeps increasing
}

Forgive my ignorance of the C++ threading semantics but when do these threads end? Inspection shows we do clear-up CPU and thread structures on exit. That said we do have a comment in linux-user that says:

    /* TODO: Free new CPU state if thread creation failed.  */

So I wonder if thread creation is actually failing and and that is where we start leaking?

The thread creating is not failing. The thread is just running the function with line: 'std::this_thread::sleep_for( 10ms );' 
in the thread, thus waiting for 10ms. Once finished, the thread function ends, which should also end and cleanup the thread.
(when putting some std::cout console output before the sleep it does show up).
The main thread waits for that in in the join function.

By running:

  valgrind --leak-check=yes ./qemu-ppc tests/testthread

I can replicate a leak compared to qemu-arm with the same test....

So something funky happens to the PPC translator for each new thread....

Could you try an experiment and put a final 30 second sleep before the program exits. I suspect the RCU cleanup of the per-thread data never gets a chance to cleanup.

Nope we think we have identified the leak. On CPU realize (ppc_cpu_realize) the translator sets up its tables (create_ppc_opcodes). This will happen for each thread created. This would be fine but linux_user cpu_copy function then does:

    memcpy(new_env, env, sizeof(CPUArchState));

which will blindly overwrite the tables in CPUArchState (CPUPPCState) causing the leak. The suggestion is the data should be moved to PowerPCCPU (as it is internal to the translator) and avoid being smashed by the memcpy. However longer term we should replace the memcpy with an arch aware smart copy.

The opcode decode tables aren't really part of the CPUPPCState but an
internal implementation detail for the translator. This can cause
problems with memcpy in cpu_copy as any table created during
ppc_cpu_realize get written over causing a memory leak. To avoid this
move the tables into PowerPCCPU which is better suited to hold
internal implementation details.

When a CPU object is created it is parented during it's realize stage.
If we don't unparent before the "final" unref we will never finzalize
the object leading to a memory leak. For most setups you probably
won't notice but with anything that creates and destroys a lot of
threads this will add up. This goes especially for architectures which
allocate a lot of memory in their CPU structures.

I think (as I mentioned on IRC) that we also need to unrealize
the CPU object, because target/ppc at least does some freeing
of memory in its unrealize method. I think we do that by
setting the QOM "realize" property back to "false" -- but that
might barf if we try it on a CPU that isn't hotpluggable...

thanks

I have tried:

             thread_cpu = NULL;
+            object_unparent(OBJECT(cpu));
+            object_property_set_bool(OBJECT(cpu), false, "realized", NULL);
             object_unref(OBJECT(cpu));

but it didn't manifestly change anything (i.e. both with and without
setting realized the thread allocated stuff is freed). Valgrind still
complains about:

But I don't know if that is just because the final exit_group of the
main CPU just exits without attempting to clean-up. However it is better
than it was.

Well without:

  Subject: [RFC PATCH for 4.1] linux-user: unparent CPU object before unref
  Date: Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:01:33 +0100
  Message-Id: <email address hidden>

it doesn't matter as we never attempt to free the memory once a thread
is destroyed. This causes all linux-user guests that create and destroy
threads quickly to slowly leak memory. However due to the dynamic opcode
table ppc/ppc64-linux-user guests leak a lot faster than most, in the
order of ~50k each time a thread is created and destroyed.

However I'm happy to defer to you as the maintainer :-)
