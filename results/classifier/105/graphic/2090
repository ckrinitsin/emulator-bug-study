Long initialisation of VM before boot.
Description of problem:
When i start VM in "Virtual machine manager" I got black screen, which hang there approximately one minute. After this delay VM begin booted and all work properly. Some time ago VMs booted immediately without mentioned delay after starting of VM. I checked all relevant log files, changed 3 times kernel, rebuilded Qemu, but problem persist. I don't know when problem began.
