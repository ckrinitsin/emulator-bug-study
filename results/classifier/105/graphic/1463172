destination arm board hangs after migration from x86 source

The qemu destination on an arm board hangs after migration from a x86 source. With qemu emulating Arch, the migration works fine while the vm is still in the boot selection screen, but if the machine is booted, then the destination arm board vm hangs indefinitely after migrating from the x86 source. This bug does not occur the other way around, meaning a booted vm originally run on arm board will continue to work after migrating to a x86 destination.

To be sure I'm understanding right, are you migrating from qemu-system-arm on x86 to a native arm board?  What are the exact parameters you are passing the emulator, and what exactly is the physical board?

I am migrating qemu-system-i386 on a x86 to an other qemu-system-i386 on an arm. The exact command line is "qemu-system-i386 -hda arch.img -boot d". The arm board is the APM883208 X-C1. The hard drive image is stored in a share nsf system.

Sorry, I forgot the include in the ram size parameter. I normally set it to 512m so qemu-system-i386 -hda arch.img -boot d -m 512m.

Thanks for the information.

I'm suspect that this sort of migration is not expected to work, but I've marked the bug as affecting upstream in case someone there can comment.

I'm going to mark this invalid as I don't believe this is a supported case.  If someone can vouch for the fact that this is supposed to work, please leave a comment.

I think it is in theory supposed to work, but possibly in practice it doesn't...


Hm, ok, thanks - sadly i don't have any board I can test this on with me.  Wonder whether a rpi2 (which I have but not with me) would work.

Hi,

would it be possible to run the emulator on arm under gdb (with debugging symbols intalled), do the incoming migration, and then when it hangs, show a backtrace from gdb?

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
