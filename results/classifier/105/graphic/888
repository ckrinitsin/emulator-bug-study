TCG <--> KVM behavior difference (TCG bug)
Description of problem:
This app couldn't start in TCG mode in QEMU 6.2, but with KVM everything is good. Until version 6.0 it also works with TCG.
As I checked - problem git commit is 5f9529006ea37560c97b05661a84472431d25b91.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install Allplayer
2. Try to run it in TCG and KVM mode with QEMU 6.2
