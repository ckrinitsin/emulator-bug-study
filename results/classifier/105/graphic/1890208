Mouse pointer disappears when it is over console window

The host mouse pointer disappears when it is over a console window.

I am emulating quite simple hardware: just text console and no mouse. I don't expect the mouse to have any effect on the emulated computers, but I need to know where the mouse pointer is. That is  important because I need to use the mouse to switch between applications and to switch between virtual machines (QEMU grabs Alt+Tab events). Also, it is quite tricky to work with multiple screens when we don't know where the mouse pointer is.

I am using:
* Virtual Machine Manager 2.2.1
* QEMU 4.2.0
* Fedora 32
* KDE Plasma 5.18.5

Does your emulated machine have a graphics card (VGA or something similar)? If so, you might need to remove it from the guest. Also, have you tried to report this issue to the virt-manager project first?

The emulated machine (guest) has the following graphics card, according to lspci:
00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Red Hat, Inc. QXL paravirtual graphic card (rev 04)

The host machine has the following graphics card:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GM107GLM [Quadro M1000M] (rev a2)

I haven't tried to report the issue to virt-manager, but I have another computer running Debian with a similar setup and the problem does not happen there.

I also reported this issue in:

This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
