qemu's monitor and parallel create huge window

I have qemu 2.1. When I try to switch to monitor or parallel0, I get window which is 30 *thousand* pixels in height. It is only gray with no content. This did not happen with previous versions of qemu.

Kwin crashes because it cannot handle such a huge window.

1.6.0 is good at least.

2.1 is OK with vte 2.90, not with 2.91

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
