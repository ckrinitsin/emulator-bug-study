vfio bug with all no VGA card

Hello,

I whant to report to you a realy big bug.

vfio passthrough work only with VGA card ! When i try to use vfio with any other PCI or PCI-E card it does not work.

When i use vfio for VGA i can reboot (or shutdown and start again) my VM with out problem, but for any other PCI card the VM refuse to reboot.

In dmesg i have this error :

dmar: DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
dmar: DMAR:[DMA Read] Request device [xx:xx.x] fault addr 2affde000
DMAR:[fault reason 06] PTE Read access is not set

and some time the same but for Write and not Read.

I found a kind of work around but it's ugly. Just detach your devices from vfio, re-atach to his normal driver and bind again to vfio.

For information i use an Asrock Z87 Extrem 6 with a CoreI5 4570S
My kernel is 3.12 and Qemu is 1.7-rc0

Some adjustment,

It's seem this not appear with my Intel network card i211.

But i can confirme this bug appear with AsMedia 1061 sata3 controler.

the complete dmesg : 

[  404.206866] dmar: DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
[  404.206870] dmar: DMAR:[DMA Write] Request device [07:00.0] fault addr 2affdf000

I start my VM with :

It's appear with linux kernel 3.12.0 and 3.13-rc2
Qemu version is 1.7 (no rc).

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
