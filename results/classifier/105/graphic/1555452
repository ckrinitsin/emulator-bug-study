GDB server does not work in Windows

I build qemu with msys2, MINGW64. After fix the socket_error() problem, and manually specify to use IPv4, GDB server still does not work.  The related qemu command is
"-monitor none -nographic -gdb tcp::1234 -S"
GDB reports "Timed out"

There's a message at https://<email address hidden>/msg357981.html.
I've fixed the socket_error() problem.
I see that qio_channel_create_socket_watch is called.

It seems that someone is fixing this at https://<email address hidden>/msg358825.html

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
