Weird error trying to autodetect CHS disk geometry
Description of problem:
Error: "SSD Read Error"

Something about the contents of the disk causes qemu to wildly misdetect the disk geometry.
This disk started as a blank disk, and had a FAT filesystem written to it from inside it; thus
writing the detected geometry to the disk. And this caused the detected geometry to change to
something nonsensical.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Unpack the attached [hd.bz2](/uploads/53f5bb00cdd563223bea1f7a0f86fe1c/hd.bz2) to hd.img
2. Run qemu -hda hd.img
3. Observe error
Additional information:
The following command appears to fix the problem; however it is wrong:

qemu -drive if=none,id=dr,file=hd.img -device ide-hd,drive=dr,cyls=1023,heads=16,secs=63

The problem with this command is this command yields only 504MB instead of the 512MB the
disk is actually formatted to be. CHS translation should be enabled on this disk but won't
be with this command.

This command was copied essentially blindly from "Removed features" because that's what comes
up for a google search for "qemu specify geometry" and I don't understand the command well
enough to correct it.
