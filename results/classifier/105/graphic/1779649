Suspending a domain works with a 3.16 gues kernel but not with a 4.16 one

Suspending a domain with `systemctl suspend` works with a guest 3.16 kernel (jessie), the domain goes into `pmsuspend` in libvirt but doesn't work anymore with a 4.16 one (sid) where:
 - With a QXL card: the spice display just goes black and the domain stays `running` in libvirt but is "dead"
 - With a VGA card: the screen goes black and comes back immediately, the domain stays fine

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
