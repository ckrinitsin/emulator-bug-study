0.15.1 black screen and 100% cpu on start

Trying the freshly compiled 0.15.1 (command line: "qemu"), the window stays black, it uses 100% cpu, and can't be killed with ctrl-c, has to be killed with killall -9.

Strace shows it's waiting on a futex forever?

Build config:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --interp-prefix=/usr/local/share/qemu \
--enable-mixemu --disable-brlapi --enable-io-thread --audio-drv-list="oss alsa sdl" \
--disable-opengl



Triaging old bug tickets... I assume this problem has been fixed in newer versions of QEMU? Or can you still reproduce this behavior with the latest version?

Feel free to close this. I think I moved to qemu-kvm, which worked.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
