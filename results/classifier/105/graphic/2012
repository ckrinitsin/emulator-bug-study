Possible regression: Windows 95 setup fails on show of license
Description of problem:
Install of Windows 95 fails when showing the license. Qemu v8.1.0 is fine, Qemu 8.1.3 and later failes. Git bisect suggest the problem may have been introduced at 9fb45b05582438dcd52d2d48d48feb05de680c37
Steps to reproduce:
1. Find install CD for Windows 95 and a DOS boot floppy
2. Create a harddrive (size 300MB)
3. Boot from floppy, create and format partition C: using all available space
4. change to the CD at D: and run command SETUP.EXE
5. follow instructions until display of license
6. See error: SUWIN caused a General Protection Fault in module <unknown>
