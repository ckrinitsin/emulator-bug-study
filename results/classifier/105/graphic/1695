Latest Windows MSI does not include libssp-0.dll
Description of problem:
The latest Qemu MSI installer for Windows (https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/2023/qemu-w64-setup-20230530.exe) does not include libssp-0.dll, which is why the executables fail to run.

This Mingw library should be included when building the MSI if stack protection is enabled.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install the latest qemu MSI
2. Try to invoke any qemu command
3. Use Dependency Walker to easily find missing dependencies (https://www.dependencywalker.com/)
