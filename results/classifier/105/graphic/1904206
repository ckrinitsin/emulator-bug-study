install QEMU

I want install QEMU on Kali, I write : 

qemu-system-arm -kernel ~/qemu_vms/kernel-qemu-3.10.25-wheezy -cpu arm1176 -m 256 -M versatilepb -serial stdio -append "root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 rw" -hda ~/qemu_vms/2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-full.img -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::5022-:22 -no-reboot

The answer :

WARNING: Image format was not specified for '/home/kali/qemu_vms/2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-full.img' and probing guessed raw.
         Automatically detecting the format is dangerous for raw images, write operations on block 0 will be restricted.
         Specify the 'raw' format explicitly to remove the restrictions.

I tried a lot of solutions but nothing worked. Please help

QEMU is working fine, but your guest kernel has crashed. Either your guest kernel is the wrong one for the "versatilepb" machine type, or the kernel wants a dtb file and you are not passing one via QEMU's -dtb argument.

Unless you like debugging "board bring-up" issues, I recommend that you find a good tutorial on running an Arm Linux system on QEMU and follow it; that will be faster than trying to diagnose and fix what config/kernel/etc mismatch you've made.


  Thank you very much for your answer. I have already watched two tutorials, but it does not work. Do you have a tutorial for me? Thank you
