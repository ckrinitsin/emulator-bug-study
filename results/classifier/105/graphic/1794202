Trying to install Mac OS X 10.5, it gives this error, "Mac OS X cannot be installed on your computer."

When I try to install Mac OS X 10.5, it gives this error, "Mac OS X cannot be installed on your computer." Command ran in the command-line: "C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-ppc" -L pc-bios -boot d -M mac99,via=pmu -m 512 -hda "C:\Users\*****\Downloads\macosx105\MacOSHDD.qcow2" -cdrom "C:\Users\*****\Downloads\macosx105\osx leopard install.iso" -netdev user,id=mynet0 -device sungem,netdev=mynet0



Fixed issue by switching boot from d to c. I found the solution by just seeing if it would work, and it does.
