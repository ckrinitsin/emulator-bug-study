Qemu 2.8  on PPC64 issue with input

Hi devs,
on my PPC64 machine if i start qemu with gtk,gl=on or with sdl,gl=on i have issue with pointer and keyboard. pratically not input at all.
This issue is present in tgc and in kvm

without gl=on option in kvm with mate as guest i have the input device work in the beginning but after some time the usb goes "unplugged" (i see this message on the serial log of qemu usb unplugged) and the keyboard and mouse dont work.

On Debian jessie kvm i dont have input working at all.

my machine is a G5 quad with Fedora 25 PPC64

thanks
Luigi

Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
