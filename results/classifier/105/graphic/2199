QEMU8 not working properly for Win9x guest
Description of problem:
Cannot boot to Win9x desktop. Enter safe mode of Win9x, then open C:\Windows\system\iosubsys, then rename drvwq117.vxd to drvwq117.vxd.bak, this problem solved.<br />
Sound card and network card not found in Win9x Device Manager.<br />
Cannot change resolution in Win9x Control Panel, this will cause "RUNDLL32 program error".

We found that Plug-and-Play (\$PNP) and PCI IRQ Routing (\$PIR) functions of SeaBIOS are buggy for Win9x guest.
Steps to reproduce:
1.Install Win98 RTM on QEMU8, it cannot boot to Win98 desktop.<br />
2.Install WinME on QEMU8, it will stuck on "copying files".
