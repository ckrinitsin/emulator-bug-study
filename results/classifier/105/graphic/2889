mouse does not work in pass in
Description of problem:
I have this script to start qemu that passes in my mouse, keyboard and xbox controler. When I use it, it does not move the cursor(for my mouse) but the mouse is working because the hot corners do work. Moving my mouse in a up left direction in GNOME will show the menu and apps. Key board works, My controller works, and My mouse works, but the cursor does not move. Here is the script:
Steps to reproduce:
1. run the script above with the right variables.
2. Move your mouse in the screen. It will not move the pointer.
Additional information:
I am using thees patches in qemu but it does not work in vanilla ether:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241010182427.1434605-1-seanjc@google.com/

and this in the kernel (6.14.0):
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/377b2f359d1f71c75f8cc352b5c81f2210312d83

I am ruining qemu 10.0.0-rc1 (but 9.2.2 also does not work), kernel 6.14.0.

I am runing mint on my host and arch on my guest. on my host I have virglrenderer on and on my guest I installed the pacman package lib32-vulkan-virtio and vulkan-virtio.

If it helps I can remove the pass throws and insted use:

-usbdevice tablet -usbdevice mouse -usbdevice keyboard
or
-device virtio-mouse -device virtio-keyboard -device virtio-tablet
