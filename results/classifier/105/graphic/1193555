Add scale options to window menu

This is a workaround against bug #504368, which makes QEMU window text blurry if resized. This is a common and annoying problem:

The ability to resize window is a feature - it allows to adjust viewport of QEMU to the convenient working area. But there should be an option to restore the size of the window or scale it like 1:2, 2:1 etc. I don't know about if that should be exposed to QEMU monitor as some "window <command>" set , but it would be extremely convenient to provide at least Ctrl+Alt+U functionality through window level menu.

Ubuntu 13.04, QEMU 1.4.0

Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
