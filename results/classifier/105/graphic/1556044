Redox GUI hangs with 100% CPU on ARM

Booting into Redox OS cli on ARM with qemu-system-i386 works fine. However, starting the Redox GUI (orbital) brings up the graphical interface and then starts using 100% CPU. I'd guess it's related to mouse detection and handling.

The OS image is fully usable on x86.

Which QEMU version have you been using here? Can you still reproduce the problem with the latest upstream version of QEMU?
