Cocoa video corruption when guest uses RGB565 mode

The cocoa video driver doesn't currently support when the guest uses RGB565 or HighColor mode resulting in corrupted video.  The initial graphics screen of recent Ubuntu installs is an example.  The attached patch against 0.13.0-release seems to fix the problem by introducing an indirect data provider that translates from RGB565 to RGB888, a mode that core graphics supports.



Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU? If so, could you please rebase your patch to the latest git version and send it to the mailing list (see http://qemu-project.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch for details)? Sorry, we do not take patches from the bugtracker, they always have got to be discussed on the qemu-devel mailing list first.
