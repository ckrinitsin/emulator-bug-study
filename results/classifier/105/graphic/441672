Windos XP BSOD with HP Photosmart usb device attached

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=524723 has all the details of the problem.

I was just testing attaching a USB device to see if it really worked, and tried my HP Photosmart C5580 All-in-One
printer/scanner, and the Windows XP box then started getting bluescreens and crashing at random
(fairly short :-) intervals.

My latest attempt was on a fedora rawhide system with pretty up to date software
(qemu-kvm-0.11.0-2.fc12.x86_64), and the crashes still happen.

A reply to that bugzilla recommended adding this upstream bug, so here it is.

Please use qemu-1.0 + ehci. The UHCI layer seems to cause this problem when handling some USB 2.0 devices. I had similar problems but with EHCI + qemu-1.0 it was fixed. See docs/usb2.txt for USB 2.0 support.

Can you still re-create this issue with the latest version of QEMU? If not, I think we should close this bug nowadays...

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
