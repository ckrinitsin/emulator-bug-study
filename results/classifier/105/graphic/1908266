spice unnecessary forces nographic

When spice is enabled, qemu does not give the graphical window. It should not imply -nographic but only -display none.

More precisely, there should be a way to prevent -vga qxl from being wired to the graphical window.

Not clear what you are looking for ...

-spice doesn't imply -nographic.
-spice flips the default for -display to none.
-vnc has the same effect btw.

You can use -display {gtk,sdl} and -spice at the same time,
but you have to explicitly enable -display then.


The gtk window is not limited for -display but also for compatmonitor / serial /paralel, but when -spice is used, the gtk window does not show at all. While you can force the window to show with -display gtk, but the *side effect* is the vga will be wired/connected to the gtk window (which seems to break things when gl and so on is enabled).

Yes, display devices show up on both UI and spice/vnc,
and right now there is no way to contigure that.

Using spice fot the vga and gtk for serial/monitor
is rather unusual though.  Any reason for this?

I'd suggest to simply use the gtk ui instead.
It works with opengl (-display gtk,gl=on).
You also can show stuff side-by-side in
separate windows, via menu -> view -> detach tab.



Does the spice protocol / any spice client allow access to compatmonitor / serial /paralel?

Spice can be (if not often / mainly) used for remote access like VNC, but that does not necessarily mean users would want to host "fully-headless".

Try "qemu -display spice-app", then go to menu -> view -> displays in virt-viewer.
