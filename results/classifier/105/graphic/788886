Crash with -m32 and gcc-4.2 on Mac OS X 64bit

For building 32bit Qemu on Mac OS X 10.6.7 , i configure with --extra-cflags=-m32 --extra-ldflags=-m32. make with gcc-4.2 then crashes with:

  GEN   qemu-options.def
  CC    qemu-nbd.o
gcc-4.2: -E, -S, -save-temps and -M options are not allowed with multiple -arch flags
make: *** [qemu-nbd.o] Error 1

Which version of QEMU were you using? Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU and the latest version of macOS?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
