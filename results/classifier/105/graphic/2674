NextSTEP 3.3 for Sparc graphical glitches
Description of problem:
It installs/boot by using complex boot syntax and taskset -c 0 under Linux

see end of https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/2620#note_2207999780

But after it installs I see  some gfx corruption
Steps to reproduce:
1. install NEXTSTEP 3.3 for RISC computers
2. Boot to desktop (may need ctrl-c  to skip some services at startup)
3. Select Info and watch for Workspace Manager info window to appear.
4. Move this window to the right - it corrupts!
Additional information:
Bug also exist if I boot qemu with  -g 1024x768x24

Moving window vertically (up/down) does not corrupt it
Moving any window around corrupt it.

Resizing and scrolling inside say Terminal emulators work.

There was 86Box issue around one FPU instruction that looked a bit like this, 
is there way to check fpu emulation?
