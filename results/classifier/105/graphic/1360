Starting using WSL fails even if the same image is valid when starting qemu directly from windows
Description of problem:
I'm trying to follow a rust tutorial on writing a custom OS in rust. https://os.phil-opp.com/minimal-rust-kernel/
The problem occurse when trying to run qemu from wsl. If I run qemu from a windows command line everything works as expected. 
If I run the os calling qemu (installed on windows) from wsl it fails with 

```
ERROR:../../../block.c:1715:bdrv_open_driver: assertion failed: (is_power_of_2(bs->bl.request_alignment))
Bail out! ERROR:../../../block.c:1715:bdrv_open_driver: assertion failed: (is_power_of_2(bs->bl.request_alignment))
```

I also found an old bug report that seemed to be the same issue in the old issue tracker: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1893807
Steps to reproduce:
1. Sample code can be found at `https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os` branch: `post-02`
2. create wsl environment
3. run `cargo install bootimage` only required on the once to install bootimage
4. run `cargo build`
5. run `cargo bootimage` to create the image
6. `qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=target/x86_64-blog_os/debug/bootimage-blog-os.bin`
