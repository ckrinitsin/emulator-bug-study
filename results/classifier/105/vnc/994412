reverse vnc to unix domain sockets does not work

I tried to connect to a unix domain socket, but failed.

$ qemu -vnc unix:/tmp/my.sock,reverse
connect(unix:/tmp/my.sock,reverse): No such file or directory

I guess it is because unix_connect does not remove characters after first comma.

Looks like this should work nowadays (of course you need to start a listening program first), so closing this bug ticket now.
