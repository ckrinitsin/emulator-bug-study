kvm flag is not exposed by default

Hi I found that the kvm flags is not exposed by default, but according to the source code, it should be exposed by default when the CPU Model is a X86CPU.

we have to specifically add "kvm=on" in QEMU custom cpu args like this:
<qemu:arg value='host,kvm=on,+invtsc,+hypervisor'/>

Also the libvirt can't expose kvm because this (libvirt assumes the kvm flag is exposed by default, only "kvm hidden = 'true'" can be used.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
