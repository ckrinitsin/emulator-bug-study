performance regression in qemu-user + proot

To reproduce:

1. Install qemu-user-static and proot
2. Enter some arm chroot using them:

    proot -0 -q qemu-arm-static -w / -r chroot/ /bin/bash

3. Run a command which normally takes a short but measurable amount of time:

    cd /usr/share/doc && time grep -R hello

Result:

This is over 100 times slower on 18.04 than it was on 16.04. I am not sure if proot or qemu is causing the problem, but proot version has not changed. Also note that on 16.04 I am using the cloud repo version of qemu, which is newer than 16.04 stock, but still older than 18.04.

Although system 2 is lower spec than system 1, it should not be this much slower. No other software seems to be affected.

If required I can supply a chroot tarball. It is essentially just a Debian bootstrap though.

Also, I noticed this while running a script that normally takes 12 minutes. After 12 hours I killed it. It never stopped advancing or threw any errors. It was just excruciatingly slow the whole time.

That script builds chroots and can be found here: https://github.com/ali1234/rpi-ramdisk

Hi Alistair,
I've seen a few similar reports, but afaik it is an upstream issue - we have no custom ubuntu bits in that area applied.

To confirm that and ask upstream about it I'D ask you if you have a way to build qemu from upstream and check which version there broke it?

origin/master is also affected.

This upstream bug may be related. It has a patch.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1740219

Thanks for the check Alistar,

Lets add a Qemu (upstream) bug task so this one is mirrored to the ML.

I'm not familiar with that area, but on the ML one can decide if it is a dup to https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1740219 or not.

I just tested the patch from https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1740219 and it fixes the problem for me. Specifically I only tried the final patch of the series.

Then lets join there and let your update give that thread some new life.
