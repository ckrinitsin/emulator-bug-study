I checked "ps -ef|grep qemu" before and after the command, there was no qemu process running.

Have you tried to disable the GUI with "-display none" already?

I tried with following and it work:

qemu-system-x86_64 -no-user-config -nodefaults -name u64d01 -M q35,accel=hvf,usb=off,vmport=off -cpu host -smp 4 -m 8192 -overcommit mem-lock=off -overcommit cpu-pm=off -rtc base=utc,clock=host -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=ssd1 -drive id=ssd1,file=/Users/js/code/vm/qemu/u64s01.qcow2,if=none,format=qcow2 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=nic1,mac=52:54:98:76:54:33 -netdev user,id=nic1,ipv4=on,ipv6=on,hostname=u64d01,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -daemonize -display none -device virtio-tablet-pci -device virtio-vga -show-cursor

The difference from my original command:
(1) removed -audiodev
(2) added -display none

So (1) and (2) together allow -daemonize work correctly.

Other observation during testing:

- If I only do (1), but not (2), the command will not exit, I cannot ssh into the vm. So it seems vm initialization is stuck. I can ctrl-c to break it.

- If I don't do (2), regardless of (1), I get following errors:
objc[1962]: +[NSNumber initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.
objc[1962]: +[NSNumber initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the fork() child process. Crashing instead. Set a breakpoint on objc_initializeAfterForkError to debug.

Not sure if above observations are expected or unhandled error.

I mixed up some thing in #2 above. Please ignore it and use following:

  - A qemu-system-x86_64 process is created in background, but I cannot ssh into the it. I have use 'kill' to kill it.

- If I don't do (1), regardless of (2), I get following errors(as in my bug description):

objc[1962]: +[NSNumber initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.

Anything else I should supply to move status away from incomplete?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
