Make Uninstall Rule Requested

Environment: Ubuntu 14.04 - Qemu 2.1.1
------------------
I've configured qemu with some --prefix, compiled the sources and installed the binaries; now, for some reason, I need to uninstall qemu to configure it with the default prefix, recompile the sources and reinstall the binaries.
However, there's no rule to uninstall qemu.

All other packages which I have compiled and installed on my system offer the possibility to uninstall it: why not Qemu?

just come to do the same...need to revert and cant :-(

Can ubuntu 14.04 support the "checkinstall" program?
If yes, then can we use the checkinstall program to fix this issue??

Almost 5 years old. Please close this thread.

Now we use meson for a build system, supporting "make uninstall" is potentially tractable, because meson itself supports 'uninstall' and we don't have a custom meson install script. We should check whether this is just a simple matter of wiring up the make target to meson and then do it, or else decide we don't want to support the feature...


It already works since "make uninstall" is forwarded to "ninja uninstall" and from there to meson.

This change is almost sufficient:

diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile
index 76dbb917f5c..da01e3cd16a 100644
--- a/Makefile
+++ b/Makefile

-makefile-targets := build.ninja ctags TAGS cscope dist clean uninstall
+makefile-targets := build.ninja ctags TAGS cscope dist clean
 # "ninja -t targets" also lists all prerequisites.  If build system
 # files are marked as PHONY, however, Make will always try to execute
 # "ninja build.ninja".

It makes "make uninstall" uninstall things; however it doesn't uninstall the various LC_MESSAGES files that meson installs, because those are installed by a "custom install script" that's part of the meson i18n module, and meson's uninstall functionality doesn't uninstall things installed that way. So it's a bit half-baked :-/



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
