qemu 4 crashes with this parameter attached -usb -device usb-host,hostbus=1,hostaddr=7 \

Hello.

qemu / kvm does not start anymore after upgrading ubuntu from 19.04 to 19.10 and qemu from 3 to 4,as you can see below. what can I do ?

root@ziomario-Z390-AORUS-PRO:/home/ziomario/Scrivania/OS-KVM# ./boot-OS-HSP2.sh

----> qemu-system-x86_64: /build/qemu-UryNDZ/qemu-4.0+dfsg/hw/usb/core.c:720: usb_ep_get: asserzione "dev != NULL" non riuscita.

./boot-OS-HSP2.sh: riga 40: 26312 Annullato (core dump creato) qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 16000 -cpu Penryn,kvm=on,vendor=GenuineIntel,+invtsc,vmware-cpuid-freq=on,$MY_OPTIONS -machine pc-q35-2.9 -smp 4,cores=2 -vga none -device vfio-pci,host=01:00.0,bus=pcie.0,multifunction=on -device vfio-pci,host=01:00.1,bus=pcie.0 -device vfio-pci,host=01:00.2,bus=pcie.0 -device vfio-pci,host=01:00.3,bus=pcie.0 -usb -device usb-host,hostbus=1,hostaddr=7 -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly,file=$OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=$OVMF/OVMF_VARS-1024x768.fd -smbios type=2 -device ich9-ahci,id=sata -drive id=Clover,if=none,snapshot=on,format=qcow2,file=./'Mo/CloverNG.qcow2' -device ide-hd,bus=sata.2,drive=Clover -device ide-hd,bus=sata.3,drive=InstallMedia -drive id=InstallMedia,if=none,file=BaseSystemHS.img,format=raw -drive id=BsdHDD,if=none,file=/dev/sdg,format=raw -device ide-hd,bus=sata.4,drive=BsdHDD -netdev tap,id=net0,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no -device e1000-82545em,netdev=net0,id=net0,mac=52:54:00:c9:18:27 -monitor stdio

It seems that this line is not good anymore (it worked with qemu 3.x) : 

-usb -device usb-host,hostbus=1,hostaddr=7 \

when I removed it,it works. But I need that. With what can I change it ? You can reproduce that upgrading ubuntu 19.04 to 19.10 because in that way also qemu will be upgraded from 3 to 4. These are the packages that I'm using :

root@ziomario-Z390-AORUS-PRO:/home/ziomario# qemu-system-x86_64 --version
QEMU emulator version 4.0.0 (Debian 1:4.0+dfsg-0ubuntu9)

problem resolved changing this line :

-usb -device usb-host,hostbus=1,hostaddr=7 \

with this :

-usb -device usb-host,hostbus=1,hostaddr=8 \

it works with qemu 4.

Hi Marietto,
  Can you attach an lsusb output from your host?
I'm curious what host bug 1, addr 7 and 8 are.

Dave

001:008 Compx 2.4G Receiver. Problem arise because I've detached one of my USB disk and the numbering of the USB devices attached changed. specially the compx 2.4g receiver changed from hostaddr 7 to 8 and when this happens qemu 4 seems to work not as good as qemu 3.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
