Wrong cpu information is still received when using whpx acceleration.
Description of problem:
I received wrong information the other day and registered an issue, but now the latest version has not been fixed and is delivering the same wrong information.
If not fixed, Windows Home version (Windows 11 Home version) cannot run more than 5 cores with whpx acceleration.
(If you boot after setting more than 5 cores, an incorrect CPU parameter BSOD occurs during booting, and Windows 11 home version seems to allow up to 4 physical CPUs..)
* Even if you explicitly give -smp cores=n,threads=1,sockets=1 and boot, it is ignored and recognized as a PC with n 1-core CPUs.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run qemu with -accel whpx option
2. Check CPU information after booting is complete
3. Check the same CPU information after booting from a physical PC and other virtualization software (VMware, Virtual Box, etc.)
4. It has been confirmed that the number of physical CPUs and the number of cores per CPU are different from other virtualization software or physical PCs. (For example, when setting 4 cores, it is recognized as 1CPU 4Core in other virtualization software, but as 4CPU 1Core in qemu operated with whpx acceleration)
Additional information:
* The CPU was set to 4 cores, and the image was taken as a screenshot of the information recognized as the 4th processor by Linux.
