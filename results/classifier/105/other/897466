UHCI Host Controller no longer present with -usb

If on an up to date 12.04 install and I start a VM with:
$ qemu -m 192 -serial none -chardev null,id=chardevmon -pidfile /tmp/pid -daemonize -nographic -monitor tcp:127.0.0.1:4444,server,nowait -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:4422-:22 -usb -rtc base=utc -name qatest-vm -uuid ded3a46b-bb60-43f4-8113-d041aeb93cdf -hda libvirt/qatest/qatest.qcow2

Then use the 'info usbhost' in the monitor, I get:
$ echo 'info usbhost' | nc -q 1 127.0.0.1 4444
(qemu) info usbhost
husb: using sys file-system with /dev/bus/usb
$

In Oneiric and eariler, 'info usbhost' would should a UHCI Host Controller. Eg:
$ qemu -m 192 -serial none -chardev null,id=chardevmon -pidfile /tmp/pid -daemonize -nographic -monitor tcp:127.0.0.1:4444,server,nowait -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:4422-:22 -usb -rtc base=utc -name qatest-vm -uuid ded3a46b-bb60-43f4-8113-d041aeb93cdf -hda libvirt/qatest/qatest.qcow2
echo 'info usbhost' | nc -q 1 127.0.0.1 4444
QEMU 0.14.1 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usbhost
husb: using sys file-system with /dev/bus/usb
  Device 1.1, speed 12 Mb/s
    Hub: USB device 1d6b:0001, UHCI Host Controller

This breaks QRT/scripts/test-qemu.py and appears to be a regression, but I am not sure if it is a 3.2 kernel issue or a 0.14.1 vs 0.15 issue.

hm, i couldn't reproduce this with 0.15.0+noroms-0ubuntu2 on top of 3.2.0-1-generic

also couldn't reproduce it after an upgrade just now.

I did a dist-upgrade and this is still reproducible:
$ uname -a
Linux sec-precise-i386 3.2.0-2-generic #5-Ubuntu SMP Mon Nov 28 18:09:32 UTC 2011 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
$ dpkg -l | grep qemu
ii  qemu-common                     0.15.0+noroms-0ubuntu6                  qemu common functionality (bios, documentation, etc)
ii  qemu-kvm                             0.15.0+noroms-0ubuntu6                  Full virtualization on i386 and amd64 hardware
ii  qemu-utils                             0.15.0+noroms-0ubuntu6                  qemu utilities

My testing is: my amd64 Oneiric kvm laptop boots an i386 12.04 non-kvm guest which boots a minimal install i386 6.06 image. All of this is verified to work when booting an i386 11.10 non-kvm guest (which boots the same 6.06 image).

oh, sorry, i'll try without kvm.

Ok, I see now - other usb devices are there, but not the EHCI or UHCI controller.

there have been quite a few changes upstream to the usb code.  I'm building latest qemu-kvm to test with.

Latest qemu-kvm from upstream has the same problem.

Reproduced with today's qemu git head as well.

Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the latest version of QEMU, or could we close this ticket nowadays?
