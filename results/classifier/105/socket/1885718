qemu/target/mips/op_helper.c:943:5: style:inconclusive: Found duplicate branches for 'if' and 'else'

Source code is

    if (other_tc == other->current_tc) {
        tccause = other->CP0_Cause;
    } else {
        tccause = other->CP0_Cause;
    }

Thank you for reporting this!

Believe it or not, this has been a know issue to us for a while. We contacted the original contributor, and he says he can't recall what he actually meant when he wrote the segment. We left it as is until he remembers. However, this seems not likely to happen, and probably we will issue a fix soon. In any case, it is good that you reported it, many thanks!

You already reported that 6 months ago:

Remove the segment:

      if (other_tc == other->current_tc) {
          tccause = other->CP0_Cause;
      } else {
          tccause = other->CP0_Cause;
      }

Original contributor can't remember what was his intention.
