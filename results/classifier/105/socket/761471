Multicast VPN TTL hardcoded at 1

The multicast VPN opens sockets with the default TTL of 1 and there doesn't appear to be an option anywhere that will allow you to increase that.

This limits the usability of the VPN to the local network where the host server lives.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?


This is for an ancient version of QEMU and no doubt a network approach that is long since obsolete. 

Probably best to close it as an edge case. If I run into it again I'll re-raise. 

Ok, thanks, so I'll close this now.
