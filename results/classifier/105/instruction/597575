Hangs on HTTP errors when using the curl block driver

Hi,

It seems that qemu-kvm does not handle HTTP errors gracefully when using the curl block driver and a synchronous request is made (i.e. one using bdrv_read_em() for example). In these cases, if an HTTP error (such as 404 or 416) is returned, the aio thread exits but the main thread never finishes waiting for I/O completion, thus freezing KVM.

Versions affected:
At least 0.11.1 and 0.12.4 were tested and found to be affected.

How to reproduce:
Simply specify a non-existing path for an HTTP URL as a CDROM drive.
kvm -drive file=test.img,format=qcow2,if=ide,index=0,boot=on -drive file=http://127.0.0.1/static/test1.iso,media=cdrom,index=2,if=ide -boot c

qemu-kvm will hang on boot using 100% cpu as it will try to open the block device. At that point, the backtrace is (qemu-kvm-0.12.4):

Thanks

QEMU 0.11 / 0.12 are pretty much outdated nowadays ... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
