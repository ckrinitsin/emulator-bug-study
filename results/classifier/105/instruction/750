/proc/cpuinfo doesn't present guest cpuinfo for most architectures (including M1 Macs)
Description of problem:
I tried to start Blender inside an amd docker container, emulated on M1 Mac, running noVNC to access the the GUI via Chrome.
From Blender versions 2.8 and higher I get the following error message:

```
 ArchError: Could not find 'cpu MHz' in /proc/cpuinfo
  Function: Arch_InitTickTimer
      File: /home/sybren/buildbot-builder/linux_glibc217_x86_64_cmake/build_deps/deps/build/usd/src/external_usd/pxr/base/arch/timing.cpp
      Line: 133
qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped
Aborted
```

I posted the problem to Blender [here](https://developer.blender.org/T92956) as well as to docker [here](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6047).
Steps to reproduce:
You need:
- ✅ M1 Mac
- ✅ Docker Desktop 4.1.1 (69879)

Setup the Container:

1. Unzip the attached file
2. In a terminal go to the unzipped folder
3. run `source build-and-launch.sh` to build the image and spin up a container
4. open a browser and go to [http://localhost:6901](http://localhost:6901)
5. login using password `pass`
6. see the README.txt on the Desktop you just logged into
7. == Follow the README instructions ==
