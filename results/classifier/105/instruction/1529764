No video output with the official Windows XP VMWare VGA driver

Steps to reproduce:

1) Set -vga to vmware
2) Install Windows XP SP3
3) Install VGA drivers from http://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/latest/windows/x86/VMware-tools-windows-10.0.5-3227872.iso

Result: completely black screen (even after F8 -> use VGA mode).

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
