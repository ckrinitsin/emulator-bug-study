pigz crashes when running in an aarch64 chroot (entered through qemu-binfmt) with qemu 8.1.0-rc*, qemu 8.0.3 is ok
Description of problem:
If qemu 8.1.0-rc1, -rc2 or -rc3 is used, pigz crashes.
```
# chroot /chroot/aarch64 pigz /tmp/test
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
Segmentation fault
```
With qemu 8.0.3 on the same chroot enviroment, it works and produces the expected /chroot/aarch64/tmp/test.gz
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install an aarch64 chroot environment on x86_64
2. Try using pigz to compress a file inside the chroot environment using qemu-binfmt
Additional information:
Unfortunately `git bisect`-ing the issue isn't easy because many snapshots between 8.0.0 (good) and 8.1.0-rc1 (first known bad) don't compile.
