aarch64: enabling MMU causes instruction abort
Description of problem:
The title describes the problem pretty accurately, we get an instruction abort when enabling the MMU with a pretty simple set of page tables. This has been regressed from qemu 6.x.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the provided Kernel binary with the command line specified above.
2. Notice the hang after 'Initialize MMU'. I traced it down to being an instructions abort after the write to the SCTLR_EL1 register.
3. Try to run with qemu 6.x, and notice that it works.
Additional information:
This does work on actual hardware, so it has to be a qemu bug.

A binary of the Serenity Kernel has been attached to the issue. The source of that binary can be found at commit ca0e32e59fcf67a662e5d3a994d44cd7c941624a of [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity).
