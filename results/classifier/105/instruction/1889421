VVFAT is not writable from Windows NT 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0

I'm running Windows NT 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0 in QEMU 4.2.0 on Linux. I'm using a VVFAT filesystem. Command lines:

$ qemu-system-i386 -L pc -cpu 486 -m 64 -vga cirrus -drive file=nt351.img,format=raw -net nic,model=pcnet -net user -soundhw sb16,pcspk -drive file=fat:rw:drived,format=raw

$ qemu-system-i386 --version
QEMU emulator version 4.2.0 (Debian 1:4.2-6)

Creating a new directory or file on drive D: (the VVFAT filesystem) fails on Windows NT 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0 (see screenshot). It succeeds on Windows NT 3.1.

Is there a workaround, e.g. a QEMU flag or a change in the Windows NT driver settings?



The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days (otherwise it will get
closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate the ticket auto-
matically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter of the bug
in the new system and thus won't get notified on changes anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
