NVMe SQ processing gets stuck when IO queue size is small (for example 4)
Steps to reproduce:
1. Get OSv repo with the NVMe driver and build OSv with the 'Hello World' example:
```
git clone https://github.com/wkozaczuk/osv.git
cd osv
git checkout nvme_refined
git submodule update --init --recursive 
./scripts/setup.py
./scripts/build image=native-example fs=zfs -j$(nproc)
```
2. Run OSv with NVme on and point to your version of QEMU built with tracing enabled:
```
./scripts/run.py --qemu-path /home/wkozaczuk/projects/qemu/build/qemu-system-x86_64 --nics=0 --nvme -c 1  --pass-arg "--trace pci_nvme_*"
```
Additional information:
I am adding both full QEMU logs with NVMe tracing enabled and diff of my changes to QEMU code to add extra logging.
