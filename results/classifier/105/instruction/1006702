something wrong in function type_initialize() in object.c in the source code of qemu-1.1.0

In the function type_initialize() in file object.c, about line 237, the sentence : 
    memset((void *)ti->class + class_size, 0, ti->class_size - class_size);
after the 
   if (type_has_parent(ti)){}
will clean the information copied from the parent in the if block.
I'm wondering whether this will lead to a bug. Thanks.

That code has been remove with this commit:
https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=745549c8d0273d3a3d9c3701
... so I think we can close this ticket nowadays.
