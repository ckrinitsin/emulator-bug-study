qemu segfaults when security_model=none using virtio-9p-pci driver

qemu version: 0.13
commit-id: 6ed912999d6ef636a5be5ccb266d7d3c0f0310b4

example invocation:
$ qemu -virtfs local,path=/tmp,security_model=none,mount_tag=mmm r.img
one of the following must be specified as thesecurity option:
         security_model=passthrough 
         security_model=mapped
Segmentation fault

Patch is attached. Also attached is a patch that addes the space between 'the' and 'security' in 'thesecurity'.

Does not affect trunk.



Add the space in 'thesecurity'.

Current QEMU 2.7 does not segfault here anymore, and the "thesecurity" problem is also not available in the sources anymore ==> I think this can be closed nowadays.
