some instructions translate error in x86

There is some instructions translation error on target i386 in many versions, such as 2.11.1, 2.10.2, 2.7.1 and so on.
The error translation instructions include les, lds. I has got a patch, but I have no idea how to apply it.

Could you please provide some more information about the problem? What's exactly the error? If you've already got a patch, please have a look at https://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch to get some information how to submit it.

The patch is In this mail attachments, which is patch for version 2.11.1   target/i386/translate.c.
The patch is created by diff.
my English is so poor to explain how the error come, but you can see the patch result to get  it.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

We shouldn't really have let this expire, the submitter has a patch attached to the bug.

Yabi: do you have a simple test program which fails without this patch and works with it? If so can you attach it to the bug ?


I believe this to be fixed by cfcca361d77, which is present in 2.12 but not 2.11.

Since Richard pointed out a commit which fixed this in 2.12 and we haven't heard back from the submitter, I'm going to close this bug as fixed.
