dpkg-deb in userspace emulation crashes in compression routine (armv7, aarch64, s390) on some machines
Description of problem:
chroot /scratch/debian-stable/ dpkg-deb -f /var/cache/apt/archives/dpkg_1.21.22_s390x.deb Version

dpkg-deb: error: subprocess was killed by signal (Aborted), core dumped 

chroot /scratch/debian-stable/ dpkg-deb -f /var/cache/apt/archives/dpkg_1.21.22_arm64.deb Version

dpkg-deb: error: subprocess was killed by signal (Segmentation fault), core dumped 

chroot /scratch/debian-stable/ dpkg-deb -f /var/cache/apt/archives/dpkg_1.21.22_armhf.deb Version

dpkg-deb: error: subprocess was killed by signal (Segmentation fault), core dumped
Steps to reproduce:
1. debootstrap --arch=arm64 stable /scratch/debian-stable
2. chroot /scratch/debian-stable/ dpkg-deb -f /var/cache/apt/archives/dpkg_1.21.22_arm64.deb Version
Additional information:
Working environment: Debian 12 x86_64 Linux 6.1.0-25-amd64 qemu 7.2.13 AMD E-450 APU

chroot can be created on this machine, when transferred to the broken machine (including the qemu binary used for emulation) dpkg cannot extract packages and crashes
