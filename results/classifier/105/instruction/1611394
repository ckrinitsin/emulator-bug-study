qemu-ppc: Scalar Single-Precision Floating-Point instructions should not test  MSR[SPV]

According to "Signal Processing Engine (SPE) Programming Environments Manual" at
http://cache.nxp.com/files/32bit/doc/ref_manual/SPEPEM.pdf?fsrch=1&sr=1&pageNum=1

c.f section 4.2.3  and also Figure 2-2.

When MSR[SPV] is _NOT_ set, then the embedded scalar single-precision floating-point instructions
should _NOT_ generate an Embedded Floating-Point Unavailable Interrupt.


Hence, some tests for MSR[SPV] in file target-ppc/translate.c need to be removed.
Namely, in the definitions of 
1. GEN_SPEFPUOP_ARITH2_32_32
2. gen_efsabs
3. gen_efsnabs
4. gen_efsneg
5. GEN_SPEFPUOP_COMP_32

Note, the macro GEN_SPEFPUOP_CONV_32_32 is already correct.

One more thing, afaict the macro GEN_SPEFPUOP_CONV_32_64 is used by both
efs- and efd- instructions, and will need to be split in two versions.
The efs-use (i.e for efscfd) should be as it is today, but the use by efd-instructions 
(e.g efdctui) will need to add a test for MSR[SPV].



(I've looked at today's HEAD-revision of target-ppc/translate.c).

I have filed a broader ticket, Bug #1888918, reporting a very similar issue that leads to corruption/bad arithmetic when using double-precision & vector instructions.

I will be submitting a patch in the next few days that will also address this ticket.

Assuming that this commit:
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/8dcdb535d7cc4ba6270bb756e12e1d323254ed4e

is sufficient to mark this bug as Fix Committed. Please re-open if I am mistaken.

Released with QEMU v5.2.0.
