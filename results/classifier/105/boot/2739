Feature: Emulate GRUB2's initrd16 newc: feature for dynamic initrd generation
Additional information:
This feature is used in boot environments like WINPE, where GRUB2 leverages `initrd16` with `newc:` to load `wimboot` and then dynamically create an initrd containing necessary files for booting a Windows PE environment from a WIM image. Emulating this in QEMU would greatly improve the ability to test and debug such setups.
