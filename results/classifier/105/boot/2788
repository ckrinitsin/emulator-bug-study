[solved] input mouse and keyboard not working on a distro
Description of problem:
The distro work but does not take input from either keyboard or mouse.
At the boot menu (syslinux) where I have to choose the boot mode the keyboard works, but it stops working when the desktop has booted.
The distro is not blocked I can tell by observing that the clock in the panel keeps running and if I click in the qemu menubar on machine > power down, the distro correctly performs the shutdown procedure.
I have tried other distributions (porteus and tinycore) and both do not have this problem.
I also tried using as -display vnc and sdl but I have the same problem.
I am using a [portable version of qemu](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/new) but I also tried with the repository version having the same problem.
Steps to reproduce:
Simply boot the virtual machine with the distro, in my case with the portable qemu version:
./QEMU-git-x86_64.AppImage qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512 -enable-kvm -boot d -cdrom ./Nemesis-v25.01-XFCE-x86_64.iso
Additional information:
I am not expert in qemu, if you need some more data I can try to produce it
