PMPrebUSB - appcrash of qemu in Win-7-64bit

I am not sure if this issue is a bug of qemu or by Win-7.
I want to test in advance with QEMU the ability if my USB-Rescue-Drive is 
booting correctly. I have Win-7-64 and run qemu v.o.15.1.0 out of the installed RMPrepUSB v.2.1.719 
program. The settings for the preparation of my USB drive were FAT32 boot as
HD, bootloader WinPE/Win-7/Vista, set for running iso-files directly in %_ISO
\MAINMENU\Hiren’sBootCD.iso. When I run Qemu I get the messages in the cmd starting window it says:

Administrator: RMPrepUSB QEMU Launcher

If somebody can understand that behaviour I appreciate everybodies help. Thank you with regards

The QEMU used in RMPrepUSB is 32-bit only - it won't run 64-bit programs. Normally, Windows will just display an error message saying it needs a 64-bit system. Use Virtual Box for 64-bit OS testing and DavidB's Virtual Machine USB Boot application - see www.rmprepusb.com Tutorial #4

Hello,

is that correct and valid or not? Fully supported means to me, that qemu 
should work too on Win-7-64bit.. Or why does RMPrepUSB 
<http://www.rmprepusb.com/documents/rmprepusb-beta-versions> not change 
this at times of XP-64 bit, Vista-64 bit, Win-7 64 bit, Win-8  64bit, 
Win-8.1 64bit. Thank you with kind regards

RMPrepUSB will run  ON 32-bit and 64-bit Operating Systems.
That is not the same thing as  QEMU will run a 64-bit Operating System.
There is a 64-bit version of QEMU but it is very buggy and won't even boot a 64-bit Vista/7 WinPE, so it is not included.
As I said, normally when booting a 64-bit OS under QEMU, you will see a Windows message saying that the system is not a 64-bit system. For some reason you are not seeing this on your system.


Hello Steve, I had a lot of trouble over the weekend building a 
sufficiently working bootable "USB-Rescue-Drive". I summed it up in an 
attached  Word-Dokument and I am sure, you have the knowledge to solve 
my problems. For your detailed help I will expect with lots of kind regards

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest (64-bit) version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
