Windows crashes on resuming from sleep if hv-tlbflush is enabled
Description of problem:
The above steps cause my Windows VM to BSOD immediately upon waking up (even before restarting the display driver in my case).
Steps to reproduce:
1. Boot Windows
2. Tell Windows to go to sleep (observe that qemu's state switches to suspended)
3. Cause windows to wake up (e.g. using the `system_wakeup` HMP command)
Additional information:
Looking at the crash dumps always shows the "ATTEMPTED WRITE TO READONLY MEMORY" error, and always with this stack trace:

However, the process that is being created here is always `WerFault.exe`, i.e. the crash reporter. The crashing process is seemingly random. Removing `hv-tlbflush` from the command line resolves the problem. Hence, my hypothesis is that due to improper TLB flushing during wakeup, a random application on the core will crash, which spawns `WerFault.exe` which then immediately crashes again inside the kernel (also because of bad/stale TLB contents) and causes the BSOD. Perhaps one core wakes up first, requests a TLB flush, which is then *not* propagated to sleeping cores due to hv-tlbflush. Then one of those cores wakes up without the TLB flush?
