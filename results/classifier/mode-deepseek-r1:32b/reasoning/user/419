Alright, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into either user-mode or system-mode. The issue says "bsd-user dumps core for all binaries emulated." Hmm, bsd-user sounds like it's related to user-mode emulation because the '-user' part often refers to running binaries in a user-space environment without a full OS. So, if it's causing cores to dump when running binaries, that points towards an issue with how user-mode processes are handled. System-mode issues usually involve higher privileges or devices, which don't seem to be mentioned here. Therefore, this is likely a user-mode problem.
