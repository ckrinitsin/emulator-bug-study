Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user' or 'system'. The error message mentions 'linux-user', which usually refers to user-mode emulation in QEMU. So, the issue is likely related to how user-space applications are being handled. Since it's about a misaligned address for a struct type, it doesn't involve high privileges or hardware devices but rather software execution. Therefore, this should be a user-mode issue.
