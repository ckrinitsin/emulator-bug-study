Okay, so I'm looking at this issue where someone is reporting a problem with QEMU, specifically mentioning that the "Issue template" is broken. The user wants me to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' related or 'system-mode' related.

First, I need to understand what 'user-mode' and 'system-mode' mean in the context of QEMU. From what I know, QEMU can run in two modes: user mode and system mode. User mode is when QEMU runs a single application (like compiling code) without booting an entire OS, while system mode emulates a full computer, including the hardware and operating system.

The issue here is about the "Issue template" being broken. That makes me think this isn't related to how QEMU emulates hardware or runs an OS but rather how users report issues within the project. So it's more of a process or documentation problem, not something that affects the actual emulation functionality.

Since the bug report isn't about QEMU's emulation capabilities, peripherals, device drivers, or the operating system it's running, it doesn't fall under 'system-mode'. Instead, it seems like an internal tooling issue for developers contributing to QEMU. That would be related to user-mode tasks because it's about how users interact with the project's reporting tools.

Therefore, I think this should be classified as a 'user' mode issue.

The bug report is about an issue template problem, which relates to how users report issues rather than QEMU's emulation functionality. Thus, it falls under user-mode tasks.
