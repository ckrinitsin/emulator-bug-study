Alright, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let's break it down.

The issue is about building QEMU 9.0.0 on CentOS 9 without root access. The problem arises because the make install process removes necessary RPATH attributes from the binary. This causes QEMU to use an older system version of libslirp instead of the correctly installed one in a user directory.

RPATH is related to runtime linking, which affects how binaries find their shared libraries when executed. In this case, the correct RPATH points to a user-specific library location, but it's being stripped during installation.

The workaround involves not using make install and manually copying the binary instead. This suggests that the issue is about application setup rather than kernel or system-level operations.

Since the problem revolves around application linking and execution in a user context without requiring higher privileges or interacting with system devices, it falls under 'user-mode'.
