Alright, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU installation on Windows 10 as either user-mode or system-mode. Let me think through the details.

The issue is that when installing the latest release (20190712) of the 64-bit version, the setup extracts all necessary files correctly but then deletes them after extraction, leaving no trace except for the installation folder. The setup completes successfully without any errors indicated. However, a previous release installed without problems.

First, I should understand what user-mode and system-mode bugs typically involve. User-mode issues are related to applications running with standard privileges, possibly dealing with file handling, UI elements, or software logic within their own process space. System-mode issues often relate to lower-level operations requiring higher privileges, such as driver interactions, hardware access, or deep OS integrations.

In this case, the problem is during installation. The setup correctly extracts files but then deletes them. That suggests an issue with how the installer handles file system operations after extraction. Installers usually run with user-level permissions unless they require specific system-level changes, which might involve UAC elevation.

The fact that the setup finishes successfully and only leaves the installation folder suggests it's more about the application's own process rather than interacting deeply with the OS kernel or hardware. There might be an error in how the installer script is written, perhaps mistakenly triggering a deletion command after extraction.

Since the problem is related to file operations during installation without involving system-level resources like drivers or hardware, this seems like a user-mode issue.
