Okay, I need to figure out whether this bug report is related to user-mode or system-mode in QEMU. The user is having trouble building QEMU versions 0.13.0 and higher because it can't find libSDL when using the same configure options as before. They mentioned that version 0.12.5 works fine, but newer versions cause issues.

The user is trying to build with `./configure --static --enable-sdl --target-list=i386-linux-user`. The error is about missing libSDL. I know that SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a library for handling graphics and input in applications. So the issue seems to be related to QEMU's configuration when building user-mode emulation.

User-mode QEMU emulates a CPU architecture and runs binaries without requiring the full OS stack, which is lighter and faster. The error here doesn't seem to involve system-level components like device drivers or higher privileges but rather the build process and dependencies for user-mode targets.

So the problem is likely with the build setup for user-mode emulation when enabling SDL. Maybe newer QEMU versions have different requirements or paths for SDL, causing it not to find the library during configuration.
