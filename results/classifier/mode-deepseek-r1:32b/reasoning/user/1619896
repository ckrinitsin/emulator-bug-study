Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is happening when running the TeamSpeak server using QEMU's user-mode emulation on an ARM host.

The problem described includes errors like "Unsupported ancillary data: 0/8" and connection drops after a few seconds with two clients. From the logs, it seems to be occurring in qemu-linux-user during syscall handling.

User-mode emulation deals with running applications without full OS virtualization. Since QEMU is acting as a CPU emulator here, it's likely related to how system calls are translated or handled. The error message points to the linux-user/syscall.c file, which supports user-mode specific code.

Also, the issue arises when using the x86 binary on an ARM host via QEMU, which aligns with user-mode since it's about translating machine code rather than emulating a full system.

Therefore, this is a user-mode related bug.
