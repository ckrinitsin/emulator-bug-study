Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this Qemu bug is user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is happening when building Qemu-1.3.0 on Solaris 10, specifically during the configure step. The error messages mention bad substitution and missing commands like 'curl-config', which suggests there's a problem with how the shell is interpreting the script.

The user mentioned that the bug report says "sh" is hard-coded in the script, preventing it from using bash or another shell. They're asking if the script can be modified to accept a $SHELL argument for different shells during configure and make steps.

Now, I need to classify this as either 'user' or 'system'. System-mode issues usually involve higher privileges, peripherals, devices, or operating systems. On the other hand, user-mode relates more to application behavior, script execution, or userland tools.

Looking at the problem, it's about the configure script not handling shells correctly on Solaris. This seems like an issue with how the build process is set up rather than something related to system-level operations or hardware interactions. It's more of a scripting and shell environment problem.

So, this bug doesn't seem to affect the core system operations but rather the build process using specific shells. Therefore, it falls under user-mode.
