Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this bug report is about user-mode or system-mode code in QEMU. Let me read through the details carefully.

The original issue was filed in Fedora's bugzilla and then moved here. The user wants more detailed information from qemu-img info, specifically things like in-use disk size, compressed clusters, and fragmentation estimation. They mention that this would help sysadmins and automated tools like gnome-boxes.

Looking at what qemu-img info currently provides: image path, file format, virtual size, disk size, cluster size. The user is asking for additional metrics to assess the "health" of an image. 

The report notes that qemu-img check already has fragmentation stats but only for QED images. So it seems like this feature request is about enhancing the information provided by these tools.

Now, thinking about whether this relates to user-mode or system-mode code. User-mode typically involves processes running without special privileges, handling higher-level tasks like managing images and their metadata. System-mode deals with lower-level operations, device drivers, and kernel interactions.

In this case, the changes are about providing more detailed statistics from existing tools (qemu-img info/check). These tools likely operate in user-mode since they don't require kernel-level access to function. The information requested is about disk usage and compression stats which are part of the image file's metadata, not related to hardware or system calls.

So this seems like a user-mode issue because it's about enhancing the functionality of user-space utilities without needing higher privileges or interacting with system devices directly.
