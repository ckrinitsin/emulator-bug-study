Okay, so I'm trying to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is happening when using qemu-i386 to run a program that uses vm86(). When the vm86 code calls an interrupt, if both cs:ip and ss:sp are in the same page, do_int tries to write to the page which isn't writable, causing a segfault.

First, I need to understand what's going on here. Vm86() is used for running 16-bit x86 code within a 32-bit or 64-bit environment. It's often used in user-mode processes to emulate older software that runs in real mode or protected mode. So the program using vm86 is probably running as a regular user application, not something with higher privileges.

The bug occurs when an interrupt is handled by do_int, which suggests it's part of the virtualization process within the emulated environment. The problem arises because the page isn't writable, leading to a segfault. Since this is happening in the context of running user-mode code (the program using vm86), I'm leaning towards this being a user-mode issue.

Moreover, system-mode issues typically involve higher-privilege operations, peripherals, devices, or OS-level interactions. This seems more about how the emulator handles memory access during interrupts within the emulated environment, which is part of the application's execution rather than the host's kernel or hardware management.

So putting it all together, I think this bug is related to user-mode.
