Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode. Let me read through the details carefully.

The problem is about gdbstub XML generation for ARM happening for every CPU. The issue arises because arm_cpu_register_gdb_regs_for_features is called during the device realize stage for each vCPU in user mode, leading to unnecessary regeneration of XML for each new thread. This becomes a problem when there are 100 threads, causing excessive memory usage beyond what QHT and PageDesc can handle.

Hmm, so this seems related to how multiple CPUs or threads are handled within the emulator. The mention of vCPU makes me think about virtualization aspects. Since it's in user mode, perhaps it's more about the way the emulator interacts with each thread rather than managing higher-level system resources like peripherals or OS components.

I remember that user-mode emulation typically deals with running applications and handling their execution, including threads and processes. The XML generation for GDB stubs is part of setting up debugging support, which is a runtime aspect for each vCPU. So this issue is about optimizing how the emulator handles multiple user-space threads rather than system-level management.

Therefore, I think this bug is related to user-mode operations because it's dealing with per-thread setup and resource usage within that context.
