Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue mentions Cirrus video issues, graphical corruption, and bad fonts. 

Cirrus is a graphics driver, so that's part of the guest OS setup in QEMU. Graphical problems could relate to how the virtual machine renders graphics. Bad fonts might be due to missing or incorrect font drivers within the VM.

Since these issues pertain to how the guest operating system is rendering and displaying content, they're more about the software environment within the VM rather than hardware-level issues. 

Therefore, this falls under user-mode because it's related to application and graphical rendering in the virtual machine.
