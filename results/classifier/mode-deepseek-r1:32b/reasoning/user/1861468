Okay, I'm trying to help someone who's having trouble building QEMU statically on their Android device using an Ubuntu environment. They mentioned that they've built it normally before but are now facing issues when trying to build it statically. 

First, the user tried enabling SDL, which resulted in an error because the configure script couldn't find SDL2 devel. That makes sense; if you enable a feature, the build system expects its dependencies to be present. So, they had to disable SDL.

But then, even after disabling SDL, other libraries like libUSB and libpng were missing. This suggests that maybe their static build isn't correctly linking against all required libraries or the environment isn't set up properly for static linking.

When building statically, you need to make sure all dependencies are also built statically. It's possible that some of these libraries (like GTK3, DRM, systemd) aren't available in a static form on their system. Alternatively, perhaps the paths where these static libraries are located aren't being correctly specified during the build process.

Another thing to consider is that building QEMU for Android might require cross-compiling if they're using an ARM64 Ubuntu environment but targeting x86 or other architectures. Maybe there's a mix-up in how the toolchain is set up, leading to linking issues with certain libraries.

The user also mentioned that their previous build was successful without static linking, so the problem seems specific to the static build setup. They might need to ensure all necessary static libraries are installed and accessible during the build.

They could try installing the development packages for these missing libraries in a static form or recompiling them from source with static linking enabled. Additionally, verifying that the linker is correctly configured to find these static libraries (using -L paths) might help.

In summary, the main issues seem to be around dependency availability and proper configuration for static linking. The user should check their environment setup, ensure all required static libraries are present and accessible, and possibly adjust their build commands or configuration scripts accordingly.
