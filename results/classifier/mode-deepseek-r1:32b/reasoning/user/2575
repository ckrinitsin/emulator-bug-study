Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is about removing deprecated CVDisplayLinkCreateWithCGDisplay() calls in Cocoa. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should understand what the problem is. The function mentioned, CVDisplayLinkCreateWithCGDisplay(), seems to be part of Core Video in macOS. It's being called from cocoa, which is Apple's framework for building GUI applications. So this is related to how QEMU interacts with the display system on macOS.

Now, I need to figure out whether this falls under user-mode or system-mode. User-mode issues usually relate to higher-level application logic, user interfaces, and things that don't require special privileges. System-mode issues involve lower-level operations like device drivers, kernel interactions, hardware access, etc.

QEMU is an emulator that can run in both modes. However, the specific issue here is about display linking in Cocoa. Since cocoa is used for GUI applications and this function relates to creating a display link for graphics rendering, it's likely part of how QEMU presents its virtual machine's display to the user.

So, even though QEMU might interact with system-level components when running virtual machines, this particular bug is about updating deprecated API calls in the GUI framework. It doesn't seem to involve kernel mode operations or device drivers. Therefore, it should be classified as a user-mode issue.
