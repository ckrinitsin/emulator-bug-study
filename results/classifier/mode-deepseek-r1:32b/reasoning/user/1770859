Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is about the qemu-img compare tool missing the -m option which allows multiple streams for faster image comparison when dealing with RBD images. The reporter mentions that convert uses this effectively but compare doesn't.

I know that user-mode issues usually involve features and functionality within applications, especially those run by users without requiring special privileges. System-mode tends to relate to lower-level operations, device drivers, or interactions with the OS kernel.

In this case, the problem is about an application tool (qemu-img) not having a specific feature (-m option). It's about improving performance through multi-streaming during image comparison. Since it's about enhancing how the tool operates and not about system hardware or kernel-level functions, it falls under user-mode.
