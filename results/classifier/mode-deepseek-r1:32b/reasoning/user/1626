Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this QEMU issue is a user-mode problem or a system-mode problem. Let me start by understanding the problem described.

The user mentions that when they run QEMU, it changes the temporary directory from /tmp to /var/tmp. Their sysadmins have set up the system so that normal users can't write to /var/tmp, which causes issues for them because they want QEMU to use /tmp instead. They're asking if there's a way to configure QEMU to use a different temp directory, maybe through an environment variable or a ./configure option.

Now, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' related or 'system-mode' related. From what I remember, user-mode refers to processes running with normal user privileges without needing special permissions, while system-mode involves higher privileges, often interacting with hardware or the OS kernel.

In this case, QEMU is being run by a normal user who can write to /tmp but not to /var/tmp. The problem arises because QEMU is automatically switching the temp directory without allowing configuration. This seems like it's about how QEMU handles file permissions and temporary files in a user context. It doesn't involve any hardware or kernel-level operations, just file system access.

So, since this issue pertains to how QEMU operates as a regular user application and its handling of temporary directories without requiring special privileges, I think this falls under 'user-mode' related.

The issue is about QEMU's behavior when running as a normal user, dealing with file permissions in the user context. It doesn't involve system-level operations or hardware.

Answer: user
