Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU where AVX/AVX2 isn't detected in user mode. The report is about a problem with the detection of these instruction sets when running in user mode.

First, I remember that user-mode emulation in QEMU allows running untrusted code without needing privileges, often used for debugging or testing. System-mode, on the other hand, involves full system emulation where QEMU acts like a virtual machine, handling hardware devices and possibly requiring higher privileges.

AVX and AVX2 are CPU instruction sets that enhance performance. If they aren't detected in user mode, it's likely an issue with how QEMU is setting up or emulating the CPU for applications running in user space. Since this is about the detection within user-mode execution, it doesn't involve higher privileges or device emulation which would be system-mode concerns.

Therefore, the bug is related to user-mode because it pertains to the application's ability to detect CPU features while running under QEMU's user-mode environment.
