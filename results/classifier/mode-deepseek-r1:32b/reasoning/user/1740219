Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. Let me read through the problem again.

The issue is about QEMU's static Linux-user ARM emulation having a slow startup time when updated from version 2.8 to 2.11. The user mentioned that the statically linked 2.11 version causes the `qemu-arm` command to take several seconds, whereas the dynamically linked version or the old static version doesn't have this problem.

The key points are:

- It's a static build of QEMU-user.
- The issue occurs in `init_guest_space()` within `elfload.c`.
- The function tries to map two address spaces and can't find an acceptable base quickly, leading to thousands of attempts.
- Factors include increased guest_size (from 0xf7000000 to 0xffff0000) and PIE/ASLR disabled in static builds.

The problem seems related to how the user-mode emulation is handling memory mappings. Since it's about the Linux-user part, which runs user-space applications under QEMU, this isn't dealing with system-level stuff like devices or high privileges. Instead, it's about the guest process's address space management in user mode.

So, I think this bug falls under 'user' because it's about running user-mode applications and their memory handling within the emulator.

The issue pertains to how QEMU's user-mode emulation handles memory mapping for static builds, specifically with an increased guest size and disabled ASLR. This affects the performance of user-space applications run through the emulator.
