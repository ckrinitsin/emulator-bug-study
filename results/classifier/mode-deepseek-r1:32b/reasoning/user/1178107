Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this QEMU issue is a user-mode or system-mode problem. Let me think through it step by step.

The user is reporting that when they run `qemu-system-arm -cpu ?` on Windows, nothing happens, but the same command works fine on Linux, giving them a list of available CPUs. They're seeing an exit code of 0, which usually means no error, but there's just no output.

First, I need to understand what `-cpu ?` does. From my knowledge, this option is used to query the list of supported CPU models for QEMU. On Linux, it outputs a list, so why isn't that happening on Windows?

I recall that sometimes command-line options behave differently across operating systems due to how commands are parsed or executed. Maybe the way arguments are handled in Windows versus Linux affects this.

But wait, the user mentioned they're using `qemu-system-arm.exe`. Since it's an executable file, perhaps there's something about how the command is processed on Windows that's causing the issue. Maybe the argument isn't being correctly interpreted because of case sensitivity or another difference in the shell used on Windows versus Linux.

Alternatively, could this be a problem with QEMU itself? Maybe the code responsible for listing CPUs doesn't handle certain environments properly. If it's an output redirection or printing issue, that might fall under user-mode, as it's more about how the program interacts with the user rather than system-level operations.

I should also consider if there are any environment variables or settings on Windows that could affect this behavior. For example, maybe the PATH is different, or some required dependencies aren't being met when running on Windows.

However, since the problem relates to command-line argument handling and output, it seems more like an application-level issue rather than something involving system privileges or device management. That would make it a user-mode related bug because it's about how QEMU processes its arguments and displays information to the user, not about interacting with hardware or kernel-level components.

I don't think this involves any higher-privilege operations since listing CPU models doesn't require special permissions. It's just about displaying available options, which is part of the application's normal functionality in user mode.
