Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this QEMU build issue on RHEL6 is a user-mode or system-mode problem. The user mentioned that they're building for the arm-linux-user target, which suggests they're working in user mode since it's about emulating a CPU instruction set without full OS virtualization.

The error points to MAP_HUGETLB not being defined in /usr/include/bits/mman.h. I remember that MAP_HUGETLB is related to huge page support, which can be used for performance optimizations. Looking at QEMU's commit history, the issue started with commit 541e16904, so it's likely a recent change.

Since RHEL6 is older, its headers might not include this macro, causing the build failure. The user asked if RHEL6 is still supported by QEMU and wants a fix. That makes me think it's more about user-mode because they're targeting specific userspace emulation rather than system-level virtualization where MAP_HUGETLB might be handled differently.

So, considering the target is user mode and the issue is with headers in the build environment, I classify this as a 'user' problem.

The bug report relates to building QEMU for the arm-linux-user target on RHEL6, which involves user-mode emulation. The issue arises from missing MAP_HUGETLB support in the system's headers.
