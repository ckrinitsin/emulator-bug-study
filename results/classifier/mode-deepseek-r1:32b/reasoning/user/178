Okay, I need to classify this Meson setup failure in QEMU as either a user-mode or system-mode issue. Let me think about what each of these entails.

User-mode issues are related to software running without special privileges and typically involve application-level problems. System-mode involves higher privileges, hardware devices, peripherals, and interactions with the operating system kernel.

QEMU is an emulator that can run in both modes. However, when setting up Meson, which is a build system, it's more about configuration and building the project. This likely doesn't involve device drivers or high-level OS interactions but rather how the application is built. So this seems like a user-mode issue.
