Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The problem is about a segfault when running GCC tests under qemu-aarch64. It mentions that the size of siginfo structures in Linux and QEMU differ, leading to an ABI incompatibility.

So, what do I know? User-mode emulation involves running userland applications without needing kernel-level access. System-mode would involve higher privileges, handling peripherals, devices, or emulating the OS more deeply.

In this case, the issue is with signal handling between the Linux Kernel and QEMU's implementation. The bug seems to be in how QEMU handles system calls related to signals. Since it's about the ABI compatibility, which affects how userland programs interact with the system, it likely falls into user-mode emulation because it's about executing applications correctly.

The fix involves changing a macro in syscall_defs.h, which is part of handling system calls for userland processes. This suggests that the issue is within QEMU's user-mode setup rather than its full system emulation.

So I think this bug report should be classified as 'user' mode.
