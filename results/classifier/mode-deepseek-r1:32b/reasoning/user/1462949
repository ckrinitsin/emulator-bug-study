Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue is about the qemu-img tool consuming a lot of time and memory when handling vmdk files. From what I know, user-mode issues typically relate to applications running in a non-privileged environment, while system-mode involves lower-level components like hardware drivers or OS functions.

The bug report shows that using 'qemu-img info' on two specific vmdk files causes high CPU usage and memory consumption. The output from the commands indicates that it's dealing with file handling and parsing. Since qemu-img is a user-space tool used for managing disk images, this seems to be related to how the application processes these files.

The errors mentioned are about file size and format specifics, which don't involve hardware or kernel-level operations. Therefore, this issue is likely within the application's processing in user mode rather than interacting with system resources like devices or peripherals at a lower level.
