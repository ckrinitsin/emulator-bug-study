Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue is that QEMU 3.0.0 isn't supporting the lxvwsx instruction for POWER9 target when running in linux-user mode. Let me break down what's happening here.

The user is compiling a program using a cross-compiler (gcc-powerpc64le-linux-gnu) and then running it under QEMU. The error occurs because the lxvwsx instruction isn't recognized by QEMU, leading to an illegal instruction crash. They also mention that when they implement a workaround—using two separate instructions instead of lxvwsx—the program works fine.

So, this seems related to how QEMU handles user-space instructions. Since the problem is about executing user-level code and the instruction isn't supported in user-mode emulation, it's likely a user-mode issue. System-mode issues usually involve higher-privilege operations or device handling, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Therefore, this bug report falls under 'user'.
