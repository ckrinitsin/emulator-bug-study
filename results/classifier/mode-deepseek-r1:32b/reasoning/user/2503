Okay, so I need to figure out whether this bug report about installing a CMake script in QEMU with RISC-V is related to user-mode or system-mode. Let's break it down.

First, what does the problem involve? The user is talking about installing a CMake script within QEMU, specifically using the RISC-V architecture. CMake is a build automation tool that generates project files for various IDEs and build systems. So, they're likely trying to set up their development environment to use CMake with QEMU for RISC-V.

QEMU can run in two main modes: user-mode emulation and system-mode emulation. User-mode emulates just the CPU and a limited set of system calls, useful for compiling or running applications without a full OS. System-mode emulates a complete system, including hardware devices, which allows booting an OS.

In this case, the issue is about installing a CMake script. That suggests they're setting up their build environment to perhaps compile code that runs on QEMU's RISC-V emulator. Since building and compiling are typically user-space activities, especially when dealing with tools like CMake, it seems more aligned with user-mode.

Moreover, if there was an issue with peripherals or device emulation, that would lean towards system-mode. But since the problem is about a build script installation, it's likely related to how the toolchain is set up for compiling programs in QEMU's user-mode environment.

So putting it all together, this bug report is probably related to user-mode.
