Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user' or 'system'. Let me read through the problem again.

The user is experiencing graphic session freezes and logouts after about 10-15 minutes when using VSCode and Firefox. This happens both with X and Wayland. The issue didn't occur for over a year but started after some updates, possibly affecting Ubuntu or Lubuntu. They even tried a fresh install of Lubuntu 20.04 LTS without extra software, but the problem remains.

The user mentioned that using just the console doesn't reproduce the issue quickly, which suggests it's related to graphical applications rather than system-level processes. Since this happens consistently with common applications like VSCode and Firefox, it points towards a user-mode issue because these are user-space programs interacting with the display server.

Considering that they've looked into logs without finding anything useful, it might not be an obvious kernel or hardware problem. If it were a system-mode bug, there might be more specific errors in dmesg or other system logs related to drivers or hardware interactions.

The fact that both X and Wayland are affected also leans towards something graphical but not necessarily at the kernel level. It could be a library or driver issue in user space.

So, putting it all together, this seems like a user-mode problem because it's application-specific and occurs within the graphical session without deep system-level issues.
