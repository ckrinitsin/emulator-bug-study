Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let's see what the issue is about.

The problem is with the QEMU 7.0.0 NSIS installer. The user mentioned that when they run the exe installer, it's missing a lot of properties in the file properties dialog. They provided some specific instructions that are missing in the QEMU.nsi file, like VIAddVersionKey for various fields such as ProductName, ProductVersion, etc.

They also pointed out an issue with the icon used in the Windows program list about uninstaller. The line they have is defining MUI_UNICON to a specific path, but it's probably pointing to an incorrect or missing icon file. Additionally, there's a missing line that sets the Publisher info for the uninstaller via WriteRegStr.

So, thinking about this, these issues are related to how the installer is built and how it interacts with Windows during installation and uninstallation. The missing version keys would affect properties visible in the exe file's details tab, which is part of the user experience when interacting with installed software. The icon issue affects the visual representation in the control panel, which again is a user interface element.

These problems don't seem to involve low-level system operations, device drivers, or kernel-related issues. Instead, they're about how the installer presents itself to the end-user and handles its own metadata and icons. Therefore, this bug is more related to user-mode software aspects rather than system-mode components.
