Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The user mentioned that documentation needs updates regarding QEMU. So, first, what's the context here? QEMU is a machine emulator and virtualizer. It can run in both modes, but let me think about where the issue lies.

Documentation typically relates to how users interact with the software, the tools, or the APIs provided by QEMU. Since it's about documentation needing updates, it's probably not related to low-level system operations like handling hardware devices or running as a hypervisor. Those would be system-mode issues because they involve higher privileges and lower-level functions.

The user didn't mention anything about device drivers, kernel modules, or virtualization at the hardware level. It's more about providing information or improving the guides for users to use QEMU effectively. So this falls under user-mode because it's about how users engage with the software rather than the underlying system operations.

Therefore, I should classify this bug report as 'user'.
