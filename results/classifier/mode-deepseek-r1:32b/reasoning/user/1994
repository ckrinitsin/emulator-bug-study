Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The user mentioned a macOS window sizing issue. Let me think about what each category entails.

User-mode issues are typically related to how the application behaves in terms of its interface and user interactions. So if it's something like window sizing, rendering, or UI elements not responding properly, that would fall under user-mode. On the other hand, system-mode issues usually involve lower-level operations such as device drivers, hardware interactions, or kernel-level problems.

In this case, the bug is about window sizing on macOS. That sounds more like how the application presents itself to the user rather than any underlying system processes or hardware interactions. So I think it's a user-mode issue because it relates to the graphical interface and user experience within QEMU.
