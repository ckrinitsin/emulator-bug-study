Okay, let's try to figure out whether this issue is user-mode or system-mode related. The problem is about escape characters not working when using QEMU with the -display curses option on macOS via VS Code or SSH.

First, I'll recall what user-mode and system-mode mean in bug reporting contexts. User-mode issues are usually related to applications running on top of the OS without needing higher privileges. System-mode involves lower-level stuff like hardware drivers, kernel operations, etc.

The issue here is with escape sequences not being recognized properly. The user mentioned that it works when using the graphical display but not with curses. That suggests it's something specific to how QEMU handles input in different display modes.

Looking at the tests, pressing Alt + 2 from an SSH session gives a different result than Option + 2 on macOS Terminal. This makes me think it's related to how the terminal is interpreting the key presses and sending them over SSH.

The user also noticed that pressing ESC and then 2 quickly works if they press both at the same time. This points towards timing issues in how QEMU captures these escape sequences when using curses, which might be a part of the application (QEMU) rather than the OS or hardware.

Since the problem is about input handling within an application (QEMU), and not involving kernel operations or device drivers, it seems more like a user-mode issue. It's likely related to how QEMU processes escape sequences in curses mode versus graphical mode.

Therefore, this bug report should be classified as 'user' because it involves application-level handling of keyboard inputs.
