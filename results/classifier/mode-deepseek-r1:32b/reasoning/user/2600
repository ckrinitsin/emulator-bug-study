Okay, so I have this bug report about QEMU, specifically mentioning "qemu-user MAP_SHARED TB invalidation." I need to classify it as either a user-mode or system-mode issue.

First, I remember that QEMU can run in two modes: user mode and system mode. User mode is for running individual applications without the full OS, while system mode emulates an entire computer with its own OS.

The term "qemu-user" suggests this relates to the user-mode emulator. MAP_SHARED probably refers to memory mapping, which in programming terms often deals with how processes share memory. TB invalidation might relate to translating cached data (translation blocks) and ensuring they're up-to-date when shared between processes or threads.

So putting it together, since it's about memory sharing within the user-space emulation, this is more likely a user-mode issue.

The bug report pertains to QEMU's user-mode functionality, specifically dealing with memory mapping and translation block management.
