Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why QEMU isn't running my MIPS64 binary correctly. I compiled a simple hello.c program using the mips64-octeon-linux-gnu-gcc cross-compiler on an X86 machine. When I check the file type with 'file', it says it's an ELF 32-bit MSB executable for MIPS, specifically N32 MIPS64 rel2 version 1 (SYSV). It's statically linked and intended for GNU/Linux 2.4.0.

I tried running it using QEMU's mips64-linux-user mode, but I get an "Invalid ELF image" error. That's confusing because the binary seems to be correctly built for MIPS64. Maybe there's something wrong with how I'm setting up QEMU?

Then I tried the mips-linux-user mode, which is 32-bit, and it gave me an illegal instruction error. Since my binary is MIPS64, using a 32-bit emulator probably isn't right, but why does it not work in the 64-bit version either? Is there something about the Octeon architecture that QEMU doesn't handle well?

I wonder if the issue is with how the cross-compiler is set up. Maybe it's generating code that's incompatible with what QEMU expects for MIPS64, especially since it's targeting Octeon. Or perhaps QEMU has limited support for certain MIPS64 variants.

I should check if there are known issues with QEMU and Octeon MIPS64 emulation. Looking at the documentation or issue trackers might shed some light. Maybe I need to pass specific flags when running QEMU, like enabling certain CPU features or specifying the exact CPU model.

Another thought: perhaps the binary is expecting a different ABI (Application Binary Interface). The output mentions N32, which is a 64-bit ABI with 32-bit pointers. Does QEMU handle N32 binaries correctly in its user-mode emulation for MIPS64? If not, that could explain the issues.

I also recall that sometimes static linking can cause compatibility problems if the standard libraries are mismatched between the host and target. But since I'm using a cross-compiler, it should be linked against the right libraries. Maybe there's an issue with the toolchain itself or the way static linking is handled in this context.

I think I'll try building a smaller test program to see if the problem persists. If it does, then the issue might indeed be with QEMU's support for Octeon MIPS64 on X86. Alternatively, if other binaries work, maybe there's something specific about my hello.c that's causing the problem.

In any case, it seems like this is a user-mode emulation issue because I'm trying to run a user-space program without emulating an entire OS or hardware setup. So, the classification should be 'user' related.
