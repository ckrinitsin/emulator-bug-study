Okay, I need to figure out whether this bug report is classified as user-mode or system-mode related. The issue described is about installing and uninstalling QEMU on Ubuntu 14.04 using a specific version (2.1.1). The user compiled QEMU from source with a custom prefix, installed it, but now wants to uninstall it because they need to reconfigure it with the default prefix. However, there's no uninstall rule provided.

First, I should understand what user-mode and system-mode mean in this context. User-mode bugs typically involve issues that occur while running applications or software under normal user privileges. They don't require special permissions beyond those a regular user has. On the other hand, system-mode issues usually relate to lower-level operations, such as device drivers, hardware interactions, kernel operations, or tasks requiring higher privileges.

Looking at this bug report, it's about compiling and installing software from source. Compilation is generally done in user mode unless you're modifying kernel modules. Installing software can sometimes involve writing to directories that require root permissions (like /usr/local/bin), which would be system-mode tasks. However, the act of uninstalling without a proper rule might still fall under how the application was installed rather than interacting with system hardware or kernels.

QEMU itself is an emulator and virtualization tool, but compiling and installing it doesn't inherently involve kernel-level operations unless you're specifically working on the hypervisor parts, which isn't indicated here. The user's problem is about the lack of an uninstall rule in their build process, not QEMU's functionality when running.

Therefore, this seems to be a user-mode issue because it relates to software installation and package management under normal user operations without direct involvement with system hardware or kernel-level processes.
