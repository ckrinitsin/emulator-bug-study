Alright, let's try to figure out whether this QEMU issue is user-mode or system-mode related. The user is having trouble with the Cocoa display hanging on macOS 10.15 when compiling QEMU with the i386-softmmu target. They mentioned that it works fine when using SDL instead of Cocoa, and they've tried building via both HomeBrew and MacPorts without success.

So, first off, QEMU has two main modes: user-mode and system-mode. User-mode is for running unprivileged processes, while system-mode deals with emulating an entire computer system, including hardware devices and peripherals.

In this case, the problem occurs when using the Cocoa display, which is a GUI component. Since the issue arises specifically with the display backend (Cocoa vs. SDL), it's more about how QEMU interacts with the graphical interface on macOS. This suggests that the problem might be in user-mode because it's related to how the application presents its window and handles input/output.

When they disable Cocoa and enable SDL, everything works fine. This implies that the issue isn't with the core emulation (which would be system-mode) but rather with the graphical frontend (user-mode). The fact that both HomeBrew and MacPorts installations have the same problem further points to a configuration or dependency issue specific to how QEMU is built for user interaction.

Additionally, since the issue doesn't mention problems with hardware emulation, kernel-level operations, or networking/peripherals beyond the display, it's less likely to be system-mode related. System issues would probably involve more critical parts of the emulated environment failing, not just the graphical output.

Therefore, considering all these points, I think this bug is related to user-mode.
