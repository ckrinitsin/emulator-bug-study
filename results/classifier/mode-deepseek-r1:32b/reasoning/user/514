Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this bug in QEMU is user-mode or system-mode related. Let me go through the details step by step.

The problem occurs when using the "str" instruction with SP as the base register in an AArch64 environment. The code was compiled with Clang version 12.0.1, targeting aarch64-linux with memtag support and sanitize=memtag enabled. The generated assembly includes instructions like "stp x29, x30, [sp, #-64]!" and "str x23, [sp, #16]".

When the CPU executes these instructions, it's throwing a tag check fault exception. According to the ARM specification, loads or stores using SP should generate Tag Unchecked accesses, meaning they shouldn't cause exceptions for tag mismatches because MTE (Memory Tagging Extension) is designed to allow certain operations without explicit tags when using SP.

The user mentioned that the stack was mapped as tagged memory, and SCTLR was set to trigger synchronous exceptions on tag mismatches. So, the expectation is that these SP-based accesses shouldn't cause an exception since they're supposed to be unchecked.

Now, looking at the classification: system-mode issues usually involve higher privileges, peripherals, devices, or OS-level interactions. User-mode issues are about application-level code running without special privileges.

In this case, the problem arises from executing instructions that should behave a certain way according to the architecture spec. The issue is in how QEMU handles these SP-based loads and storesâ€”whether it's correctly implementing the ARM specification regarding tag accesses. Since MTE handling is part of the CPU's behavior when running user-mode code, this seems more like an issue with how QEMU emulates the CPU for user applications.

Therefore, I think this bug is related to user-mode because it's about application-level instructions not behaving as expected under certain conditions.

The bug report pertains to how QEMU handles specific ARM instructions in user-mode. The exception occurs during the execution of user-space code where SP-based stores are incorrectly triggering tag check faults instead of being treated as Tag Unchecked accesses.
