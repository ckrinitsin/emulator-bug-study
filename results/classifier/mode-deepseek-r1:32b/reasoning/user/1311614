Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user' or 'system'. The issue is that when using qemu-arm emulation for an ARM chroot environment, running certain commands like rpm, rpmbuild, or rpm2cpio causes a segfault. This started happening after upgrading gcc from 4.8.3 to 4.9.0.

First, I should understand what's causing the problem. The user has set up a binfmt_misc entry for ARM, which uses qemu-arm as the interpreter. So when they run an ARM binary on their x86 host, it gets executed through qemu in user-mode emulation.

When they upgraded gcc to 4.9.0, the segfaults began. This suggests that the issue is related to how the compiled binaries are interacting with the qemu user-mode emulator. Since rpm and other tools are causing this, it's likely an issue with the way these programs execute under user-mode qemu after being compiled with the new gcc version.

I've heard before that sometimes compiler upgrades can introduce changes in binary formats or optimizations that affect compatibility with emulators. Maybe the binaries generated by gcc 4.9.0 have some features that qemu-arm isn't handling correctly, leading to segfaults.

Since the problem occurs specifically when running ARM binaries under user-mode emulation and not in a full VM setup, it's more about how qemu handles userspace programs. This would fall under user-mode emulation rather than system-mode, which deals with higher-level operations like device drivers or OS-level functions.

Additionally, the user tried rebuilding qemu with different sources but still encountered the same issue, indicating that it might be a bug within qemu's user-mode handling for ARM when interacting with certain binaries compiled by newer gcc versions.

So, putting it all together, this seems to be a user-mode related issue because it's about executing specific userspace applications under emulation and how the emulator interacts with them.
