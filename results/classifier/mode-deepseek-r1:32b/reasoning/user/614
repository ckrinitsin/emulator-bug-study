Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The report mentions a dependency on GCC 7.5.0 allowing any version of GCC 7. Hmm, GCC is the GNU Compiler Collection, used for compiling code. 

QEMU can run in both user mode and system mode. User-mode emulation runs applications without the full OS, while system-mode emulates the entire system including peripherals and devices.

The issue here is about a compiler dependency. Compilers are usually part of the development tools and not directly related to the operating system or hardware emulation aspects. So this seems more like a user-level concern because it's about how QEMU interacts with its build environment, specifically the compiler version. 

Therefore, I think it falls under 'user' mode.
