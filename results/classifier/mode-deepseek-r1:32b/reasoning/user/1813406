Okay, so I need to figure out whether this qemu-img convert issue on macOS is a user-mode or system-mode problem. Let's start by understanding the scenario.

The user is running macOS 10.13.6 and tried using qemu-img convert from Homebrew versions 2.11.1 and 3.1.0_1 to shrink a qcow2 image. The source image was 50GB with 3.7GB allocated, but the output after conversion was only 3.4MB, which is way too small. That means something went wrong during the conversion process.

First, I should consider what qemu-img convert does. It's used to convert virtual machine disk images from one format to another. In this case, it's converting a qcow2 image to another qcow2 image, possibly with some options like shrinking. 

Since the user is using Homebrew-installed versions of qemu-img, which are user-space applications, the issue might be related to how these tools interact in user mode. However, I also need to think about whether this problem could involve system-level components.

Possible causes for the small output file could include incorrect command usage, bugs in qemu-img, or issues with disk permissions. Let's explore each possibility:

1. **Command Usage**: Maybe the user didn't provide the correct options. For example, if they tried to shrink the image but forgot necessary parameters, it might result in an incorrectly sized file.

2. **Bugs in qemu-img**: There could be a bug in the version of qemu-img being used. Both versions mentioned (2.11.1 and 3.1.0_1) are older, so perhaps there was a fix in later versions that addresses this issue.

3. **Disk Permissions or System Issues**: macOS might have some restrictions on disk operations, especially when dealing with large files. Perhaps qemu-img doesn't handle certain system-level permissions correctly, leading to incomplete writes or file truncation.

Since the problem occurs across two different versions of qemu-img and both are user-mode tools, it's likely related to how they process the image in user space rather than interacting with hardware or system services that would be system-mode issues. However, disk operations can sometimes involve system calls that might lead to such problems, but without more info on kernel panic or deeper system errors, it leans towards a user-mode issue.

Additionally, if it were a system-mode problem, we'd expect more symptoms like kernel issues, device driver failures, or interactions with peripherals, which aren't mentioned here. The output being too small suggests that the conversion process didn't complete correctly within the application itself rather than a failure in interacting with system services.
