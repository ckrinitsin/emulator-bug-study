Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this bug report is about user-mode or system-mode in QEMU. Let's see what the problem is.

The issue is that when using `-cpu max,sve=off`, SVE2 is still being advertised by `getauxval`. The user provided a code example where even with SVE off, SVE2 shows up as enabled. They argue this creates an inconsistent state because SVE should be mandatory if SVE2 is present.

QEMU's documentation says you can disable SVE with `-cpu max,sve=off`, but it seems that doesn't affect the advertising of SVE2 in AT_HWCAP2. The user suggests that disabling SVE should also turn off SVE2, or at least mention that SVE2 can't be disabled and the current behavior is a bug.

Now, classifying this: User-mode deals with how the CPU presents itself to userland applications through system calls and auxiliary vectors like `getauxval`. Since this issue involves what features are reported to user-space via AT_HWCAP and AT_HWCAP2, it's about how QEMU emulates the CPU for userspace programs. There's no mention of system-level stuff like devices or peripherals.

So, I think this is a user-mode related bug because it's about the CPU features exposed to user applications.
