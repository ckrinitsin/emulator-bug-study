Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this issue is a user-mode problem or a system-mode problem in QEMU. Let me start by understanding the problem description.

The user is reporting that when they run certain executables on an emulated Debian system using QEMU, those programs crash with SIGILL because they use the 'mffsl' instruction. This instruction isn't being emulated properly on POWER8. They provided some context from the glibc source where this instruction is used in the feenableexcept() function.

From what I gather, 'mffsl' is an instruction introduced in Power9 or later, but on older architectures like Power8, it's not recognized and causes an illegal instruction signal (SIGILL). The user also mentioned that compiling a test program on actual POWER8 hardware doesn't crash because the 'mffsl' instruction is interpreted as 'mffs', which is supported. So the problem is specific to QEMU's emulation.

Now, I need to classify this issue into either user-mode or system-mode related. User-mode issues typically involve how QEMU emulates the CPU instructions for applications running in user space. System-mode involves higher-level privileges, like handling device emulation, interrupt controllers, etc.

In this case, the problem is about an instruction not being correctly emulated by QEMU when it's executing a user-space program. The 'mffsl' instruction isn't recognized on POWER8 in the emulator, causing applications to crash. This sounds like a CPU instruction emulation issue, which falls under user-mode because it's about how user applications are executed.

So, I think this is a user-mode related bug.

The issue pertains to QEMU's ability to emulate specific CPU instructions for user-space programs, indicating a problem in the user-mode emulation.
