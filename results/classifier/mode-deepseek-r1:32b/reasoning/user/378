Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue mentioned is that indentation should be done with spaces instead of tabs. This sounds like a code formatting problem within the source code.

I know that user-mode relates to applications running in user space, while system-mode involves lower-level aspects like hardware, OS kernels, and device drivers. Since this bug is about coding style in QEMU's codebase, it doesn't directly involve system operations or device management. It's more of a development practice issue rather than something affecting the system's operation.

Therefore, I think this should be classified as 'user-mode'.
