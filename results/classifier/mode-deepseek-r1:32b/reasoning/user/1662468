Okay, so I need to figure out whether this feature request for qemu-img convert falls under 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let's break it down.

The user is suggesting that when you run qemu-img convert, which can take a long time, the program should respond to Control-T (which sends SIGINFO) by showing progress information. They compared it to dd and other utilities that do this. The classification they're asking about is whether this issue is related to 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'.

First, I need to understand what user-mode and system-mode mean in this context. User-mode typically refers to applications running with normal privileges, without needing deep access to hardware or kernel-level functions. System-mode issues often involve higher privileges, interactions with devices, peripherals, or the operating system at a deeper level.

Qemu-img convert is part of QEMU, which is used for disk image conversions. It's an application that runs in user space; it doesn't require special privileges unless you're dealing with certain device access, but generally, it's a userland tool.

The feature request here isn't about hardware interaction or kernel functions. It's more about how the application handles signals and provides feedback to the user during execution. This is something that applications do in user-mode, like handling SIGINFO to display progress without needing system-level privileges.

So, considering all that, this seems like a user-mode issue because it's about how the application behaves when receiving a signal, not about interacting with low-level system components or devices.
