Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue is about the qemu-nbd tool failing when using both -s (which creates a new active layer) and --load-snapshot options together. 

First, I'll think about what qemu-nbd does. It's used for exposing disk images over Network Block Device (NBD), which allows them to be accessed like regular block devices on the host system. The -s option is related to creating a sparse file or handling layers in QCOW2 images, while --load-snapshot loads a specific snapshot.

The problem occurs when both options are used together. So, it's about how qemu-nbd interacts with these command-line arguments and processes them. Since this involves parsing commands and managing image states within the tool itself, it seems like an internal issue in the user-space application rather than something related to kernel or device drivers.

User-mode bugs typically involve applications running on top of the OS without requiring kernel-level changes, whereas system-mode issues often relate to hardware, device drivers, or kernel operations. Since this is about command-line options and image handling within qemu-nbd, it's more likely a user-mode problem.

I don't think it involves any kernel-specific functions or device management beyond what's standard for such tools. Therefore, the classification should be 'user'.

The issue pertains to how qemu-nbd processes its command-line arguments in user space without involving system-level operations.
