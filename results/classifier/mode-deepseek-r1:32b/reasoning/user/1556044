Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this Redox GUI issue is a user-mode or system-mode problem. Let me start by understanding the situation.

The user reports that when booting into Redox OS CLI using qemu-system-i386 on an ARM machine, everything works fine. But when they start the GUI (orbital), it uses 100% CPU. They suspect it's related to mouse detection and handling. The OS image works well on x86.

So, let me break this down. Redox is a microkernel operating system, which means that many services run in user mode. The GUI, being graphical, probably relies on certain drivers or services for input handling, like the mouse. If the mouse isn't detected properly, especially on ARM compared to x86, it could cause an infinite loop or high CPU usage.

Since the CLI works fine, the basic system boot is okay. But when the GUI starts, which likely involves more user-space components, maybe something goes wrong in how these components interact with hardware. If the mouse isn't detected correctly on ARM, perhaps the event loop for handling mouse events is stuck waiting or polling continuously, causing high CPU usage.

In a microkernel setup, peripheral interactions might still be managed by system-mode processes, but if the GUI is using user-space drivers, it could be a user-mode issue. However, if the problem stems from hardware detection that's handled at a lower level, maybe it's a system-mode problem.

But considering that the CLI works and the GUI doesn't, and the GUI involves more user applications, I'm leaning towards this being a user-mode issue. The high CPU usage might be due to an application (like orbital) running in user space not handling certain conditions correctly, such as failing to initialize mouse input properly on ARM, leading it to spin or loop excessively.

Alternatively, if the kernel's hardware detection for the mouse is flawed on ARM, that would be system-mode. But since the issue arises specifically when starting the GUI, which runs in user mode, I think it's more likely related to how the GUI application interacts with its environment rather than a deeper system issue.
