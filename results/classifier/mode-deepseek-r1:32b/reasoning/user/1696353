Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this bug report should be classified as 'user' or 'system'. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The issue is that Go binaries are failing when run under Linux-user mode in QEMU. The error message mentions a runtime failure related to creating new OS threads and points to an issue with the clone system call not passing the CLONE_SYSVMEM flag. The user provided a link to the Go source code where this happens, specifically in the os_linux.go file.

From what I know, QEMU has two main modes: user-mode emulation and system-mode emulation. User-mode runs individual applications as if they were on the target architecture, while system-mode emulates an entire operating system including peripherals and devices.

In this case, the problem occurs when running a Go binary under arm-linux-user, which is part of QEMU's user-mode setup. The issue seems to be related to how Go's runtime interacts with the clone function in user-mode. Since it's about thread creation within a single process and not involving higher-level privileges or system devices, this points towards a user-mode problem.

Also, the patch mentioned by the user is for allowing binaries to start correctly under Linux-user, which again suggests that it's related to how QEMU's user-mode handles processes and threads, rather than anything at the system level like device emulation or OS operation.

So, putting it all together, this bug is more about the user-mode environment where individual applications are run, not the broader system-level emulation. Therefore, I classify it as a 'user' mode issue.

The issue pertains to running Go binaries under QEMU's user-mode, which involves process and thread handling without higher privileges or system devices.
