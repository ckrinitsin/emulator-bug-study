Okay, I need to figure out whether this issue is user-mode or system-mode related. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user is compiling QEMU on macOS 12.x using ninja and seeing warnings from ld about -undefined dynamic_lookup not working with chained fixups. They provided links to similar issues in other projects, like Bazel, CPython, and Ruby.

Looking at the ld warning: it mentions that -undefined dynamic_lookup may not work with chained fixups. From Apple's documentation, chained fixups are a new feature introduced in macOS 12 and iOS 15. They change how dylibs are linked, making them incompatible with older OS versions.

The user is building QEMU with plugins enabled (--enable-plugins). The warnings occur during the linking of several .dylib files, like libempty.dylib, libbb.dylib, etc. So it's related to dynamic libraries and plugin loading in QEMU.

Now, considering whether this is a user-mode or system-mode issue. User-mode issues typically relate to applications running on top of the OS without needing high privileges or interacting with hardware directly. System-mode involves lower-level operations, drivers, hardware access, etc.

QEMU itself emulates hardware, which could be considered low-level. However, the specific issue here is about linking and dynamic libraries, which affects how QEMU loads plugins at runtime. Plugins are usually userland components that extend QEMU's functionality without requiring kernel privileges.

The fact that it's about dylibs (dynamic shared objects) suggests it's more of a runtime issue in the application layer rather than something interacting with system hardware or requiring kernel-level access. The warnings don't point to issues with device drivers or peripherals but rather how code is linked and loaded by the OS when running QEMU.

Additionally, similar issues have been reported in other user-space projects like Bazel, Python, and Ruby. These are all higher-level applications that don't interact directly with hardware, so their issues with chained fixups are also user-mode related.

Therefore, this problem seems to be about how QEMU's plugins are being linked under the new macOS system, which affects runtime loading but doesn't involve kernel or hardware interactions. So it's a user-mode issue.
