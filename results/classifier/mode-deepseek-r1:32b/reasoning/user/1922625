Okay, I'm looking at this bug report where someone is trying to run the configure script for QEMU 5.2.0 in a read-only directory as a different user. The problem seems to be that when they switch users, they don't have write permissions in the extracted source directory. This causes the configure script to loop and print errors because it can't create the necessary build directory or files.

I need to classify this bug into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. User-mode issues typically involve problems with user-level processes, file permissions, and access rights without requiring high privileges. System-mode issues usually involve kernel interactions, device drivers, hardware access, etc., which often require higher privileges.

In this case, the issue is about file permissions and directory access when running a script as a different user. The problem arises because the script tries to create directories and files in a read-only environment, leading to errors and an infinite loop. This doesn't involve kernel-level operations or system hardware but rather the user's permission levels and how the script interacts with the filesystem.

So, this seems like a user-mode issue since it's about file permissions and processes running under different user accounts without needing elevated privileges beyond what is necessary for typical software installations.

The bug report involves file permission issues when running the configure script as a different user. This relates to access rights and directory creation in a read-only environment, which are user-level concerns.
