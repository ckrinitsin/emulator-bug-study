Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU. The issue is that indentation should be done with spaces, not tabs, in the ARM subsystem. Hmm.

First, let me understand what the problem is. Indentation in code usually refers to how lines are spaced for readability. Using spaces instead of tabs can sometimes cause issues because different editors handle them differently. But why would this be a problem in QEMU's ARM subsystem?

QEMU has two main modes: user-mode and system-mode. User-mode deals with running applications on the host without involving the full OS, while system-mode emulates an entire computer, including hardware devices.

The bug report doesn't mention anything about device emulation or low-level hardware access. It's more about code formatting within a specific subsystem (ARM). So I think this is related to how the code is written rather than how it interacts with hardware or higher privileges.

Therefore, since it's about coding style and not system-level functionality, it's probably a user-mode issue.

The bug report pertains to code indentation in the ARM subsystem, which relates to code style and formatting rather than system-level operations. Therefore, it is classified as:
