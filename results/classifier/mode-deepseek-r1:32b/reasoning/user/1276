Okay, so I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The issue is about a blurry display when using a fractional scaling of 1.25 on a Wayland compositor like Sway. They're running an Ubuntu guest with SDL, and the display becomes blurry. The user mentioned that setting `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI` fixes the blurriness but causes scaling issues—it's not scaled properly, it's boxed.

They referenced an existing issue in the SDL repository where someone suggested this flag might be the problem. So the main points are about how SDL handles high DPI and scaling when running under a Wayland compositor, especially with fractional scaling.

Now, to classify whether this is a user-mode or system-mode issue. User-mode issues usually relate to applications or software configurations that run in the user space, not requiring higher privileges. System-mode issues typically involve lower-level components like device drivers, kernel interactions, or hardware-related problems.

In this case, the problem seems to stem from how SDL interacts with the Wayland compositor and its scaling settings. SinceSDL is a library used by applications to handle graphics, input, etc., it's part of user-space code. The issue arises when launching an Ubuntu guest, which I assume is a VM or container—still, the display configuration and scaling are managed within the application layer.

The suggestion about `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI` indicates that it's a setting within SDL's window management, not something related to system-level drivers or hardware. Therefore, this seems more like an issue with how SDL handles display scaling in user applications rather than a problem with the underlying system or device drivers.

So I think this is a 'user-mode' related issue.
