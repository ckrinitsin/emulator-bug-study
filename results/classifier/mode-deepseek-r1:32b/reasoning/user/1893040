Okay, so I'm trying to help classify this bug report into either a user-mode or system-mode issue. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the problem occurs when building a Go 1.15 image for s390x architecture. They're using QEMU and Docker with specific commands. The error message mentions buildkit-runc not terminating successfully during the build process. 

The user suspects it's related to the QEMU version. They referenced an issue in the Go repository, #40949, which I should check. Looking at that issue, it seems like there were problems with external modules retrieval on s390x using Go 1.15, possibly due to checksum and ECDSA verification issues. 

They tried a solution from a PR where they reset the QEMU user-static binary. The command used was `docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static@sha256:...` which suggests that they're setting up QEMU for cross-architecture builds.

The error occurs during the build step when running go build with specific flags, leading to a failure in buildkit-runc. Since this is happening inside a Docker container and involves Go's build process, it could be related to how the environment is set up for cross-compilation.

Now, considering whether this is user-mode or system-mode: User-mode issues typically involve software running without requiring high privileges, while system-mode deals with lower-level components like drivers, hardware access, etc. 

In this case, QEMU is being used in a Docker container to emulate the s390x architecture for cross-compilation. The problem arises during the build process, which is more about how the software is built and executed in a virtualized environment rather than accessing hardware or requiring kernel-level privileges. Therefore, it's likely related to user-mode operations.

I should also think about whether QEMU is running in user mode here. Since they're using `qemu-user-static`, that typically runs as a user-mode emulator without needing system-level drivers. So the issue might be with how the user-mode setup is handling Go's build process, possibly with environment variables or binary compatibility.

Additionally, the failure during the go build suggests it's an application-level issue rather than something related to hardware or kernel interactions. Therefore, this bug seems to fall under user-mode.
