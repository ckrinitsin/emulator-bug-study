Alright, let's try to figure out whether this issue is user-mode or system-mode. The problem is that when trying to configure QEMU from git, the error says glib-2.56 and gthread-2.0 are required but not found by pkg-config.

First, the user checked and already has libglib2.0-dev installed, which includes the necessary libraries. They also verified that the gthread-2.0.pc file exists in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/. However, when using pkg-config without specifying the path, it fails to find the package.

The user found a workaround by setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH to include the x86_64 directory, which makes pkg-config work. This suggests that there's an issue with how pkg-config is searching for its modules.

Looking at this, the problem seems related to environment variables and paths rather than hardware or system-level issues. The user didn't mention any device drivers or kernel-related components. It's more about development tools (pkg-config) not finding their files correctly.

Since it's about configuration during build time and involves development libraries and paths, I think this falls under user-mode because it doesn't involve higher privileges or direct hardware interaction.
