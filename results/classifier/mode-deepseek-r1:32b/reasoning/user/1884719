Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this bug is related to user-mode or system-mode in QEMU. The issue occurs when using libaio in a Docker container with an emulated ARM64 architecture. The error message says "Function not implemented," which suggests that the specific function call isn't supported by the emulator.

The user is using multiarch/qemu-user-static, which I believe is for user-mode emulation because it allows running binaries of different architectures without full system virtualization. They set up a Docker container with an ARM64 image and tried to compile a simple program using libaio. On native AARCH64 or x86_64, it works fine, but in the emulated environment, it fails.

They also tried stracing the process, which resulted in similar errors about ptrace not being implemented. Strace relies on certain system calls that might not be available or properly handled in user-mode emulation.

So, putting this together: the problem seems to stem from the user-mode QEMU setup where some system calls required by libaio are not implemented. Since it's an emulated environment for a different architecture and they're using user-mode tools, I think this is more of a user-mode issue rather than something related to full system virtualization with hardware support.
