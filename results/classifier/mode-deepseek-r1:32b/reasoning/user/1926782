Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is about the configure script not passing --extra-cflags to config-meson.cross when building QEMU 5.2 and above. This causes a problem where the C header 'sasl/sasl.h' isn't found during cross-building, even though it worked in earlier versions like 3.1 to 5.1.

Looking at the information given: the error occurs during cross-compilation for a target environment, which suggests it's related to building QEMU rather than running it. The user is using specific flags (--extra-cflags and --extra-ldflags) that are meant for passing compiler and linker options, especially important in cross-building scenarios.

The problem arises because the configure script uses CFLAGS instead of QEMU_CFLAGS when generating the meson build configuration. This means that any custom flags provided via --extra-cflags aren't being passed correctly to the build system, leading to missing headers and libraries during compilation.

In user-mode emulation, QEMU runs unprivileged processes for user space applications. However, this issue is about building QEMU itself with cross-compilation flags not being recognized, which doesn't directly relate to running user-mode or system-mode emulations. Instead, it's a build configuration problem affecting the development and setup process of QEMU.

System-mode issues typically involve higher-privilege operations, peripherals, device emulation, and operating systems, but this bug is more about the build environment setup rather than runtime functionality in either mode. Therefore, since it's related to compiling and not running user or system emulations, I would lean towards classifying it as 'user' because cross-compilation flags are part of the development tools and environments, which are often used by developers (users) when setting up their build configurations.

However, sometimes build issues can be seen under both categories, but given that the error is about headers not being found during compilation due to misconfiguration of compiler flags, it's more aligned with user-mode setup rather than system-mode runtime operations. So I think 'user' is appropriate here.
