Alright, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is having trouble installing QEMU 7.2.0 using make install. They provided the error message from their terminal. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the error trace, it says ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mesonbuild'. That suggests that Meson isn't installed correctly or isn't accessible when QEMU is trying to build. The user mentioned they installed Meson using pip3 --user, which installs it in their home directory. 

The file /home/clive/.local/bin/meson has a shebang pointing to /usr/local/bin/python3.11, but the script itself is trying to import from mesonbuild.mesonmain. Maybe there's an issue with the Python environment or how Meson was installed.

They also listed their versions: Python 3.11.1, Meson 1.0.0, and ninja-build 1.8.2. I know that older versions of Meson might have compatibility issues with newer Python versions. Maybe Meson 1.0.0 doesn't work well with Python 3.11.

The build process uses meson to generate the build files, and then ninja to compile. The error occurs during the install phase when running meson install. Since the user is installing as a regular user (not root), it's possible that Meson isn't properly set up in their environment or there are permission issues.

The user also mentioned using dnf builddep for dependencies, so system-level packages should be okay. But since they installed Meson and Python in their home directory, perhaps the build process isn't finding the correct Meson executable or its modules.

I think the issue is with the user's environment setup rather than the system configuration. They're installing QEMU as a regular user, and if there's a problem with Meson's installation in their .local directory, that would affect the build without needing root privileges. So this seems like a user-mode related bug.
