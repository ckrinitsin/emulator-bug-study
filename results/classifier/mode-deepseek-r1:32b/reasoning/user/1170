Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this QEMU compilation issue is a user-mode or system-mode problem. Let's break it down.

The error happens while compiling `DoubleCPDO` function in `double_cpdo.c`. The compiler (GCC) segfaults during an RTL pass called 'expand'. Looking at the code, I'm not familiar with ARM neon or FPE details, but the fact that it's part of the QEMU user-mode emulation makes me think.

QEMU has two main modes: system and user. System mode emulates entire systems with hardware devices, while user mode runs applications compiled for one architecture on another by translating machine code at runtime.

The file path mentions `linux-user`, which suggests it's related to user-mode emulation for ARMeb targets. So the problem is likely in the user-mode component of QEMU since it's during compilation of that specific part.

Additionally, I notice this happens when compiling QEMU 7.1.0-rc3 but not 7.0.0. Maybe a regression introduced in this version. Since it's during build time and not runtime, it's about how the code is being compiled for user-mode execution.

The error doesn't mention any device emulation or system-level issues, which are more common in system-mode bugs. Instead, it's about an internal compiler error while processing user-mode code.

So putting it all together, this seems like a user-mode related issue.
