Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let's see what the problem is.

The job in question is build-tools-and-docs-debian, which is wasting CI cycles building softfloat. Softfloat refers to software floating-point libraries. The user suggests a fix on an email list.

Now, thinking about system-mode and user-mode: System-mode issues usually involve higher privileges, peripherals, devices, or OS-level stuff. User-mode deals more with applications running in user space without needing kernel access.

Building documentation and tools might be part of the build process that doesn't require kernel interaction. Softfloat is a library used for floating-point operations, which could be part of the toolchain but not necessarily tied to system-level privileges or devices. 

So this seems like it's about the build environment rather than system hardware or OS functions. Therefore, it's more likely related to user-mode.
