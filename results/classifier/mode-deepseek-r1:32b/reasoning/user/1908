Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. Let's look at the details provided.

The problem occurs in `qemu-riscv64-static`, which is a static build of QEMU for RISC-V architecture. The test that fails is part of Cockatrice, specifically loading_from_clipboard_test. 

From the steps to reproduce, it involves setting up an Arch Linux riscv64 qemu-user container and building Cockatrice inside it. So, this seems to be using QEMU in user mode since it's emulating a RISC-V environment within the container.

The backtrace points to functions in `cpu-exec.c` and `cpu_loop.c`, which are part of TCG (Translation Control Grid), used for just-in-time compilation in user-mode emulation. The crash happens during code generation, which is typical for user-mode issues where QEMU translates guest code into host instructions.

Given that the bug occurs while running an application within a user-mode emulator and not when managing virtualized hardware or system-level devices, it's likely a user-mode issue.
