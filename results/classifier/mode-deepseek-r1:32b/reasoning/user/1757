Okay, so I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue is regarding improving the help messages for --allow-rpcs and --block-rpcs options in the guest-agent.

Hmm, first, what do these options do? From what I remember, QEMU's guest-agent handles RPCs which are remote procedure calls used to interact with the virtual machine. The --allow-rpcs and --block-rpcs options probably control which RPCs are allowed or blocked by the agent.

Now, considering the classification: user-mode relates to processes running without special privileges, while system-mode involves higher privileges, peripherals, devices, and OS-level stuff.

The guest-agent is part of QEMU, which typically runs in user mode when emulating a VM. The options mentioned deal with RPCs that are used for communication between the host and guest, but they don't seem to directly involve low-level hardware or kernel operations. They're more about configuration and management of the agent's behavior.

So, this bug is about improving help messages, which is a user-facing change. It doesn't relate to system-level operations like device drivers or OS interactions. Therefore, it should be classified as 'user'.

The bug report focuses on enhancing user-facing documentation for QEMU's guest-agent options, which are related to managing RPCs without involving low-level system operations.
