Okay, I need to figure out whether this bug is related to user-mode or system-mode in QEMU based on the provided information.

The user is running a Docker container using qemu-ppc64le-static for cross-compiling. They're experiencing issues when building Go applications that involve multiple threads—specifically, segmentation faults and hangs. When they limit Go to use only one thread (GOMAXPROCS=1), the problem doesn't occur.

The steps to reproduce show that the Dockerfile sets up a PPC64LE environment using QEMU as an emulator. The problem arises when multi-threaded commands like `go build` are run inside this container.

I remember that user-mode emulation by QEMU is responsible for running applications compiled for different architectures. It handles system calls and thread management in user space. Multi-threading issues often point to problems with how threads are scheduled or resources are managed within the emulator's context.

Since the problem occurs when multiple threads are used, it suggests an issue with how QEMU manages these threads in user-mode. The fact that single-threaded operations work but multi-threaded ones fail points towards a concurrency bug within the user-mode layer of QEMU. It might be struggling to handle multiple goroutines correctly under emulation.

Additionally, the error messages mention unexpected signals during runtime execution and a stopm holding locks, which are related to Go's runtime handling of threads. These issues likely stem from how QEMU is emulating the thread operations in this environment.

Given that system-mode would involve more底层硬件模拟，比如设备驱动和操作系统层面的问题，而这里的问题更偏向于应用程序在用户空间的执行问题，尤其是多线程处理。因此，这个bug更可能属于user-mode相关。
