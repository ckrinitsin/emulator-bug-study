Okay, I'm looking at this bug report where OpenJDK11+ fails to install on s390x. The issue happens during the configuration of ca-certificates-java, but `java -version` works while `jar -version` crashes. 

The error log shows a SIGILL signal, which is an illegal instruction. That usually means the JVM tried to execute an instruction not supported by the CPU. Since this occurs on s390x when running under QEMU 5.2.0, I suspect it's related to CPU virtualization settings.

QEMU might be using certain CPU models that don't support all the instructions required by OpenJDK11+. Maybe the guest OS is getting a CPU model that doesn't match the host's capabilities, especially in user-mode emulation. 

So, the crash seems tied to how QEMU emulates the CPU for s390x guests when running on different hosts, possibly amd64. Since native s390x installations work without issues, it points towards a problem with the virtualization setup rather than the OS or hardware itself.

Therefore, this is likely a user-mode issue because it relates to how QEMU emulates the CPU in the guest environment.
