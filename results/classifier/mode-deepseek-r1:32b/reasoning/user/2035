Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this QEMU plugin issue is related to user-mode or system-mode. Let me start by understanding the problem description.

The user mentioned that their plugin's exit callback isn't executing as expected. They wrote a plugin where they register an `plugin_exit` function using `qemu_plugin_register_atexit_cb`. When running their test binary, which is just a hello world program, they don't see the "Goodbye from plugin" message. However, if they make the test binary run in an infinite loop and then kill it with Ctrl-C, the callback does execute.

So, let's break this down. The plugin is supposed to print goodbye when QEMU exits normally. But in their initial setup, it doesn't happen. It only works when they force quit the program by interrupting it with a signal like SIGINT (Ctrl-C). That makes me think about how QEMU handles exit events.

In user-mode emulation, which QEMU supports when using the `-cpu` options without system devices, the focus is on running unikernels or user-space programs. The plugin here seems to be working in this context because they compiled QEMU with `--disable-system`, meaning they're not using system-mode features like hardware devices or kernels.

The exit callback likely relies on the process exiting normally. If the program exits quickly, maybe the callback isn't getting triggered in time or due to some other reason. But when they force it to terminate abruptly, perhaps the atexit handlers are being called differently, ensuring that their plugin's goodbye message appears.

Another point is how QEMU handles plugins and their callbacks. In user-mode, plugins are used for tracing, instrumentation, etc., without involving system-level components. The fact that the vcpu translation block callback works (as they see the instruction disassembly) suggests that other parts of the plugin are functioning correctly. So the issue isn't with the plugin registration in general but specifically with the exit callback.

I'm thinking that maybe in user-mode, the way QEMU exits doesn't properly trigger all atexit callbacks, especially if the program ends quickly without any specific cleanup steps. When they use an infinite loop and kill it, the process is terminated abruptly, which might ensure that certain hooks are invoked regardless of normal exit procedures.

So considering all this, since they're using user-mode emulation (as indicated by disabling system mode), the issue falls under user-mode related.
