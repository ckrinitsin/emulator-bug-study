Alright, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue is about WebSocket compatibility in VNC within QEMU, specifically with IE 11/Edge browsers not connecting properly because of a case-sensitive check on the Upgrade header. 

Looking at what's involved: it's related to how the noVNC client interacts through a WebSocket connection. This falls under user applications and web services, as opposed to lower-level system operations or hardware interactions. The patch suggested modifies a file in QEMU's channel handling, which is part of the software stack but not directly tied to system-level processes like device drivers or OS kernel functions.

Therefore, this bug is more about how user applications interact with the VNC server over WebSocket, making it a 'user-mode' issue.

The problem pertains to application-level interaction and client compatibility, not involving low-level system components.
