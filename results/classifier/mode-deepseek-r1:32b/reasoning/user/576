Okay, I need to classify this bug report into either user-mode or system-mode related. The report mentions that the new Cocoa clipboard support raises the minimum macOS version to 10.14 in QEMU.

First, I should understand what each mode involves. User-mode issues are typically related to applications running on the user level, like GUI problems or application crashes. System-mode issues involve lower-level components such as device drivers, kernel operations, hardware interactions, etc.

The mention of Cocoa suggests it's related to macOS's application framework, which is part of the system libraries but used by applications. Clipboard support might be part of how an application interacts with the OS services, possibly at a user level. However, since it's about raising the minimum OS version, this could relate to changes in the operating system's core, which would affect system-mode.

But wait, the clipboard functionality is something that applications use; it doesn't necessarily involve kernel-level changes unless the clipboard implementation has changed significantly in macOS 10.14. If QEMU requires a newer macOS version because of new API dependencies or system features needed for clipboard support, this might still be on the user side since it's about application compatibility.

Alternatively, if the change affects how QEMU interacts with system services that require higher privileges or involve device management, then it would be system-mode. But in this context, raising the macOS version due to clipboard support seems more like an application-level requirement, thus user-mode.
