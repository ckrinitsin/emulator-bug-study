Okay, I need to classify this bug report about qemu into either user-mode or system-mode. The title mentions "qemu-user", which suggests it's related to the user-mode emulation part of QEMU. User-mode typically deals with running unprivileged processes and software without needing high privileges or accessing hardware directly. Since CentOS 7 is a system, but the issue is about building qemu-user there, it's likely about the user-mode tools not compiling. So this should be classified as 'user'.

The bug report refers to "qemu-user", which relates to user-mode emulation in QEMU. Therefore, it falls under user-mode.
