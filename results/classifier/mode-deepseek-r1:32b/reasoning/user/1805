Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let me read through the problem description carefully.

The issue is about a CI job called `build-user-hexagon` not correctly testing Hexagon. The output shows that the compiler being used is a native x86_64 GCC instead of the intended Hexagon cross-compiler. The user provided logs and explanations showing that the toolchain isn't set up properly.

They mentioned that the problem arises because the container uses `cc`, which resolves to a native compiler, not the Hexagon-specific one. The toolchain installs `clang` but under a different path, so the environment variables aren't picking it up correctly. Setting `CC=clang` doesn't work because Meson detects it as a native compiler.

The fix suggested involves renaming the compiler binaries to include the target triplet and setting the appropriate `QEMU_CONFIGURE_OPTS` for cross-compiling. This setup was previously done but later removed when switching to a pre-built toolchain.

Now, considering whether this is user-mode or system-mode related: User-mode QEMU emulates CPU instructions without requiring kernel-level privileges, used for running unprivileged applications. System-mode involves emulating an entire computer, including hardware devices and OS, typically needing higher privileges.

The issue here deals with the build process and cross-compilation setup for Hexagon targets, which relates to how user-space applications are built and tested within QEMU. It doesn't mention anything about system-level emulation, hardware devices, or OS-level issues. Therefore, this problem is related to user-mode.
