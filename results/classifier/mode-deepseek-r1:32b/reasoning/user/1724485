Alright, let's try to figure out whether this bug report is about user-mode or system-mode in QEMU.

The user mentioned they're using qemu user mode. That usually means they're running a userspace application without the full OS, focusing on CPU and basic memory handling. The issue occurs during program startup with glibc's _dl_new_object calling strlen in thumb2 mode. They're seeing an assertion error in arm_read_memory_func because info->endian isn't little endian as expected.

The problem is occurring when QEMU reads memory for Thumb2 instructions, which are typically 16 bits. The assertion checks if the endianness is little, but maybe it's running on a big-endian system or target. Removing the assert allows execution to continue without issues, suggesting it might be safe in this context.

Since they're specifically using user-mode QEMU (as indicated by '-cpu any' and debugging options), the issue relates to how the CPU emulator handles memory reads for Thumb2 instructions. It doesn't involve system-level devices or higher privileges, so it's more about the userspace emulation.

Therefore, this bug is likely related to user-mode.
