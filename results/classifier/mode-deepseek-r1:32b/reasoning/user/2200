Okay, I need to classify this QEMU bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The problem is about OpenGL not working properly with SDL and GTK on Windows hosts.

First, I know that QEMU can run in both user mode and system mode. User mode involves running applications without full hardware virtualization, while system mode is for emulating entire systems with more resources like hardware devices.

OpenGL issues usually relate to graphics rendering within an application. Since the problem mentions SDL (which handles graphics and input) and GTK (a GUI toolkit), it seems to be about how QEMU interacts with these libraries on a Windows host. This likely affects the graphical output of applications running inside QEMU rather than the underlying system emulation.

So, this bug is more related to user-mode because it's about application-level rendering issues rather than lower-level hardware or OS interactions.
