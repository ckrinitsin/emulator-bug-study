Okay, I need to classify this bug report about qemu into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue is that qemu's linux-user doesn't translate host/target data for iovec I/O.

First, I know that qemu has two main modes: user-mode and system-mode. User-mode emulation runs individual programs without a full OS, while system-mode emulates an entire system with hardware devices and peripherals.

The bug mentions 'linux-user', which suggests it's related to the user-mode emulator because it's specifically targeting the linux-user component. Iovec I/O typically deals with how data is transferred between host and target environments in user space applications.

So, since this issue is about translating data for iovec in a user-mode context, it's likely a user-mode problem rather than system-mode which handles lower-level hardware and OS functions.
