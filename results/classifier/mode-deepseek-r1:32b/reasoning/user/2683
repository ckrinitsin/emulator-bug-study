Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. The problem is about the probe_access() function behaving inconsistently between full-system mode and Linux-user mode in QEMU.

In full-system mode, when the flag TLB_MMIO is set, probe_access_internal() returns NULL. This makes the code use a slow-path that injects memory callbacks correctly. However, in Linux-user mode, probe_access() doesn't return NULL for TLB_MMIO, leading to a fast-path using memset which skips these callbacks.

The issue arises because the behavior differs based on the execution modeâ€”full-system vs. user. The reporter wants consistency so that probe_access should return NULL when the flag is TLB_MMIO in both modes, but specifically points out Linux-user mode's incorrect handling.

Since this affects how memory accesses are handled in user mode and leads to different callback behaviors, it relates more to user-mode execution where plugins might be involved. Therefore, this bug is related to user-mode.
