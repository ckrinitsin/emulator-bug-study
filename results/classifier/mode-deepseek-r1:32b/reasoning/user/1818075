Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The user is using QEMU in a user-mode context because they're executing code through qemu-user, specifically for x86-64. They mentioned that the program hangs at 100% CPU when encountering AVX instructions.

Looking at the issue, it's about TCG not supporting certain features like AVX, which are related to instruction execution. The stack trace shows functions in softfloat and helper_subsd, indicating problems during floating-point operations. Since user-mode emulation deals with running applications without a full OS, this is within that scope.

The errors point to CPU feature support issues, but since it's about executing user-space code and not system-level resources or peripherals, it doesn't fall into system-mode.
