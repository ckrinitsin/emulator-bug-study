Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The problem involves using qemu-nbd and libnbd. Qemu-nbd is a user-space tool that exports disk images over NBD (Network Block Device). Libnbd is also a library used in user-space applications to interact with NBD servers.

The issue here is that the client code using libnbd is encountering an error because the qemu-nbd server doesn't support structured replies. The user is aware that their version of QEMU is old, which might not support the necessary features required by the newer libnbd API calls like nbd_block_status.

Since both the server (qemu-nbd) and the client (libnbd application) are running in user mode, this issue pertains to how these user-space tools interact. There's no mention of kernel modules or device drivers, which would typically fall under system-mode issues. The problem is about communication between two user-space applications using a specific protocol.

Therefore, this bug report should be classified as 'user' because it relates to the interaction between user-mode components without involving lower-level system privileges or hardware.

The issue involves user-space tools interacting with each other without requiring kernel-level access or device management.
