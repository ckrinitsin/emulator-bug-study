Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either user-mode or system-mode related. The error message says "Illegal instruction" with exit code 132 when running buildx.

Hmm, illegal instructions often happen when the CPU encounters an unknown opcode, which can be a problem in the software's execution. Buildx is part of Docker and deals with building images using qemu for emulation.

QEMU runs in user mode when it's emulating other architectures on the same host OS. So if there's an issue with the instructions being executed by QEMU during emulation, that's likely related to how it handles user-mode processes rather than system-level operations like hardware access or kernel functions.

Therefore, this bug is probably a user-mode issue.
