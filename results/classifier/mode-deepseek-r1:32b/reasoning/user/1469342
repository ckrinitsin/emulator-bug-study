Okay, I need to classify this QEMU bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is that when running a binary with the movsd instruction in 32-bit qemu-i386 with the -cpu pentium3 option, it executes without crashing even though PIII only has SSE, not SSE2.

First, I should understand what the problem entails. The movsd instruction is part of SSE2, which was introduced after Pentium III. So using this instruction on a CPU that doesn't support it should cause an illegal instruction exception (SIGILL). But in QEMU, it's executing fine instead of crashing.

Now, thinking about user-mode vs system-mode in QEMU: user-mode emulation deals with running unprivileged processes and their instructions. System-mode deals with higher-level operations like device management, interrupts, MMU, etc.

This issue is specifically about instruction execution being incorrect. It's not related to peripherals or device handling but rather how the CPU handles specific instructions. So it falls under user-mode because it's about the CPU executing user-space code incorrectly.
