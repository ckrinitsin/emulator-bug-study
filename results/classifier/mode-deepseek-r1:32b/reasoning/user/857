Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this QEMU issue is a user-mode problem or a system-mode problem. Let me break it down.

The user is building an embedded Linux system using Buildroot for x86_64, and during the build process, they're running into issues with their cross-compiled application under QEMU. The error messages are about missing GLIBC versions in the host libraries. Specifically, when running 'bytecode_builtins_list_generator', it's looking for certain GLIBCXX and GLIBC versions that aren't present on the host system.

From what I understand, QEMU can run in user-mode or system-mode. User-mode allows running applications as if they were on a different architecture without emulating the entire OS. System-mode emulates a full virtual machine, including hardware peripherals and devices.

In this case, the problem is with the linker searching for libraries from the host system instead of the target embedded system's paths. The strace log shows that the application is trying to access /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/... on the host, which shouldn't happen because the build should be using the embedded system's library paths.

This suggests that QEMU isn't properly isolating the environment. If it were running in user-mode, perhaps it's not correctly setting up the chroot or the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the target's libraries instead of the host's. Alternatively, maybe the application is being run without the proper environment setup, causing it to fall back to the host's libraries.

Since the issue is about library paths and linking within an application running under QEMU, it seems more like a user-mode problem. User-mode focuses on executing binaries, handling system calls, and setting up the process environment, which includes library resolution. If the environment setup isn't correct, you get these kinds of errors where host libraries are being accessed instead of the target's.

If this were a system-mode issue, I might expect problems related to hardware emulation or kernel-level issues, like device drivers not working or virtualized peripherals malfunctioning. But here, it's about library version mismatches and incorrect paths, which points more towards user-space execution and environment setup.
