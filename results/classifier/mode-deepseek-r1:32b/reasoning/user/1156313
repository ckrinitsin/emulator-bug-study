Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. The user is reporting an issue in QEMU where they're seeing improper handling of X86-64 flags, leading to spurious signals and unexpected behavior when running a specific test case.

Looking at the details, the problem occurs when compiling and executing a C program that uses inline assembly with ADX instructions (adx.s). The expected output is 0, but instead they get garbage values. This suggests an issue with how QEMU handles certain CPU flags or state during context switches.

The user mentions that the kernel seems stable, but user processes are affected. They also note that running multiple instances of the trigger program increases the frequency of the bug, pointing towards something related to process scheduling or flags handling when switching between tasks.

QEMU manages both user-mode and system-mode aspects. User-mode issues typically involve how QEMU emulates CPU instructions and handles registers and flags for user-space processes. System-mode would involve higher-level operations like device emulation, interrupts, or kernel interactions.

Since the problem arises in a user-space program and affects signal handling and flag computation during context switches (which are managed by the CPU emulator), this seems to be related to how QEMU handles CPU state transitions for user processes rather than system-level operations. Therefore, it's likely a user-mode issue.
