Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user' or 'system'. The user is talking about using qemu-img to generate a VMDK file without an EOS marker when the has_marker flag is enabled. They mentioned that deploying it as part of OVF fails but works after appending an EOS marker. 

I remember that VMDK files are used in virtual environments, often with VMware. Qemu-img is a tool for disk image manipulation, which runs in user mode because it's handling file operations without requiring high privileges. The issue here seems to be about the structure of the VMDK file and how it's recognized during deployment.

The problem doesn't involve device drivers or low-level system interactions but rather the proper formatting of a virtual disk image. Since qemu-img operates on files and not directly on hardware, this would fall under user-mode operations. The fix is related to the image creation process, which doesn't require kernel privileges. 

So, I think this bug is 'user' mode related.

The issue pertains to file manipulation by a user-level tool without requiring system-level changes.
