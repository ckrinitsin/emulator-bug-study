Okay, I need to figure out whether this QEMU bug is user-mode or system-mode related. The issue happens when running a compiled program under QEMU, which reports an illegal instruction. But the same program runs fine on a real machine.

Looking at the code examples provided, they all use inline assembly in C. These instructions involve MMX and SSE operations like psignw, psubusw, etc. I know that certain CPU extensions might not be enabled by default in QEMU unless specified.

So, the problem is likely with how QEMU handles these instructions. The real machine probably has the necessary CPU features (like MMX, SSE) enabled, allowing these instructions to execute without issues. But QEMU's emulation might not support them or might require specific flags to enable them.

In this case, since it's about executing user-space code and instruction handling, it's more of a user-mode issue rather than something related to system-level devices or privileges.
