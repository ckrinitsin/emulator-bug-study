Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user is having issues with QEMU crashing when building MIPS Linux-user binaries. They mentioned that sometimes after a while, the crashes happen randomly, but doing a full clean rebuild fixes it.

Looking at the problem, they ran the test `threadcount` and saw a crash. Then, upon cleaning all mips* build directories and rebuilding, the issue went away. This suggests there's some build artifact causing problems when incremental builds are done.

They also noticed that if they just remove specific target directories like mips64el-linux-user, and then re-run configure and make, other MIPS builds (like mip32) start failing. The error message shows an unterminated #ifndef in a header file, which implies some kind of dependency or include issue between different targets.

So the key points here are build artifacts causing issues during incremental builds, specifically when building for different MIPS targets. This seems related to how QEMU's build system handles multiple target configurations and possibly shared headers that aren't being properly cleaned or regenerated.

Since this is about the build process of user-mode emulators (Linux-user) for MIPS architectures, it falls under user-mode issues rather than system-mode which deals with full OS emulation, devices, etc. The problem isn't with running an operating system but with compiling and linking the QEMU user-mode binaries correctly.
