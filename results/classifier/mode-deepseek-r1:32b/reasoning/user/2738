Alright, let's try to figure out whether this bug is user-mode or system-mode related. The issue describes that when building Go 1.23 under QEMU-user on an x86_64 host, the build hangs. 

First, I'll break down what each term means. User-mode emulation typically involves running binaries compiled for a different architecture (like ARM) directly on another architecture (like x86_64) without needing a full VM. It's handled by user space tools like qemu-user-static. System-mode, on the other hand, usually refers to virtualizing an entire system with hardware acceleration, often requiring higher privileges and handling devices and peripherals.

Looking at the steps provided: they mention installing qemu-user-static-aarch64 and using podman build with --arch aarch64. This suggests that they're trying to cross-build for AArch64 using user-space emulation because QEMU-user is involved. 

Since the problem occurs during the build process under QEMU-user, it's likely related to how binaries are being executed in user mode rather than any system-level virtualization issues. The hang might be due to how the Go compiler interacts with QEMU's user-mode environment.

Therefore, this bug seems to fall under user-mode emulation.

The issue is related to user-mode because it involves running a cross-architecture build using QEMU-user without full system virtualization.
