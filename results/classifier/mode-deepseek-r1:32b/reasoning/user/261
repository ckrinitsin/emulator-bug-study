Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU regarding "broken signal handling in nios2 user-mode emulation." The task is to determine whether it's a 'user' or 'system' mode issue.

First, understanding the context: QEMU can emulate both system and user modes. System mode involves emulating an entire OS with higher privileges, including peripherals and devices. User mode usually refers to running applications without the full OS, focusing on CPU-level emulation.

The bug mentions "nios2 user-mode emulation," which suggests it's about how QEMU handles signals when in user mode. Signals are typically part of process management, which in user mode would relate to application execution rather than OS-level operations.

Since the issue is specifically with signal handling in user-mode, it doesn't involve higher-privilege tasks like device drivers or full OS emulation. Therefore, this bug falls under 'user' mode.

The bug report pertains to signal handling within user-mode emulation, which relates to application execution rather than system-level operations.
