Okay, I need to figure out whether this bug is user-mode or system-mode related. The user is using i3wm, which is a window manager, so that's part of the user environment. They have rules assigning QEMU's SDL window to another workspace, but when they start the guest machine, it doesn't boot until they switch to that workspace.

SDL is involved here, and since it's used for graphical output, this seems like a display or windowing issue rather than something at the kernel level. The fact that the machine freezes until the window gains focus suggests it's related to how SDL handles window focus in their setup. 

QEMU can run in both user-mode and system-mode (like with KVM). But since the problem is about the SDL window not getting focus, which affects the guest's behavior, this seems more like a user-space issueâ€”how QEMU interacts with the windowing system under i3wm. It doesn't involve lower-level hardware or kernel interactions directly.

So I think it's a user-mode issue.
