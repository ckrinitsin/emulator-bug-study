Okay, so I'm trying to help someone who's having trouble cross-compiling QEMU tools using Docker. They provided a Dockerfile that sets up the environment for building QEMU, specifically targeting qemu-img.exe. But when they run `make tools` or `make qemu-img.exe`, they get an error saying "ninja: no work to do." Then, trying to build just the object file gives a missing header error.

First, I need to understand what's happening here. The Dockerfile uses two stages: first installing dependencies in a builder image, then building QEMU in a qemu-builder stage. They've set up the working directory as /src/qemu and run `configure` with certain options. 

Looking at their configure command: they're using `--cross-prefix=x86_64-w64-mingw32-`, which seems correct for cross-compiling to Windows. The target list is empty, which might be an issue because QEMU needs specific targets defined. Maybe they should include something like `i386-x86_64` or another relevant target.

When running `make tools`, it's using ninja under the hood since Meson is involved. The output says "ninja: no work to do," which suggests that all targets are already built, but if this is the first run, that shouldn't be the case. Perhaps the build system isn't being generated correctly.

The second attempt with `make qemu-img.o` fails because it can't find `qemu/osdep.h`. That header is part of QEMU's source, so maybe the build environment isn't set up properly. Maybe the include paths aren't correct when cross-compiling.

I think the main issues are:

1. The configure command might not be setting up the build correctly for cross-compilation. They might need to specify the correct target list and ensure that all necessary libraries are included, especially since they're using static linking with `--static`.

2. The Dockerfile's steps might not be properly setting up the environment variables or paths needed for the cross-compiler. Maybe the CC and other compiler flags aren't set correctly.

3. When building only a part of QEMU like qemu-img, it relies on other built components, so maybe trying to build just that without the full setup is causing issues.

I should suggest checking the configure command's output to ensure all dependencies are met and that cross-compilation is properly configured. Also, verifying that the necessary include directories are correctly set in the build environment.

The issue described relates to building a tool (qemu-img.exe) for QEMU using a cross-compile setup. The problem occurs during the compilation phase when it fails to find required header files and indicates no work to do, which suggests an issue with the build configuration or environment setup rather than system-level operations.
