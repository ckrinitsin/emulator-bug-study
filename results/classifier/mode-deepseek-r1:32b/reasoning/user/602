Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. The problem is about translating host errno to target in IP_RECVERR and IPV6_RECVERR control messages in QEMU. The description mentions that the ee_errno isn't translated correctly, causing issues on guests with different ABIs, like MIPS.

The code snippet provided refers to lines 1970 and 2014 in linux-user/syscall.c, which suggests it's part of the user-mode emulation because QEMU has a separate directory for system calls under linux-user. That area typically handles emulating system calls for different architectures.

Since this issue is about translating error numbers between host and target systems during system call handling, it falls under user-mode emulation. It doesn't involve higher-level privileges or device emulation, which would be more system-mode related. So the classification should be 'user'.

The bug report pertains to user-mode emulation in QEMU, specifically dealing with translating error numbers during system calls. Therefore, it is classified as:

**user**
