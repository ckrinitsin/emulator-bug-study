Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this bug report is about a user-mode or system-mode issue in QEMU. The problem described is that some avocado tests are hanging when run under GitLab CI. Avocado is a test framework used for testing QEMU and other software.

Looking at the previous fixes mentioned, #2010 and #2013, I'm not exactly sure what those refer to without looking them up, but I can make an educated guess. If these were related to record/replay functionality in avocado, they might involve how tests are being run or recorded. 

The fact that the tests hang specifically under GitLab CI suggests it's a runtime environment issue. However, since this is about QEMU, which can run in both user-mode and system-mode (also known as full-system mode), I need to determine where the problem lies.

User-mode QEMU typically runs applications without a full OS, so it's more lightweight but has less overhead. System-mode involves running entire operating systems with devices, peripherals, etc., which is more complex. 

If the tests are hanging, it could be due to issues in how QEMU interacts with the host environment, possibly related to timing or resource management. Given that GitLab CI runs jobs in containers or specific environments, maybe there's a conflict with how QEMU is handling virtual devices or processes.

Since the problem involves record/replay functionality, which can be more involved when dealing with full system emulation (as it requires tracking more states), this might lean towards system-mode issues. However, without explicit details on whether the tests are user or system mode, I have to infer.

Considering that avocado is used for both types of testing, but the problem persists despite previous fixes, and it's happening in CI, which often uses containers with limited resources, perhaps it's related to how QEMU is handling higher-privilege operations or devices in a constrained environment. That would point towards system-mode issues as they involve more interactions with device models and OS-level functions.

So, I think this bug report relates to system-mode.
