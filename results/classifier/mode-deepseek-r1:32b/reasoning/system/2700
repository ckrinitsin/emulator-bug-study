Okay, so I need to classify this Windows 11 boot issue in QEMU as either a user-mode or system-mode problem. Let me think through it.

The problem is that when trying to boot Windows 11 on various systems—M4 Pro Mac with TCG, M3 with TCG, and Intel i9 with HVF—the guest just restarts. It happens both during installation and normal booting.

Windows failing to boot in a virtual machine often points towards hardware emulation issues. QEMU is involved here, so the problem is likely related to how it's emulating certain components.

System-mode issues usually involve higher-privilege operations or interactions with devices and peripherals. Since this affects multiple different setups (Apple Silicon vs Intel), it suggests a deeper issue in the hypervisor or virtualization layer that QEMU uses—like TCG or HVF in these cases.

The fact that other users are experiencing the same problem across different hardware further indicates that it's not a configuration error but something inherent in how QEMU is handling the virtualized environment for Windows 11. This would fall under system-mode because it's about the underlying infrastructure supporting the OS, not user applications or configurations.
