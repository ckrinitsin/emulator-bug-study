Okay, I need to classify this bug report into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The error message is about an assertion failing in `address_space_stw_le_cached`. Hmm, the function name suggests it's related to memory access or caching. QEMU handles both user and system emulation.

I recall that address space management in emulators can be part of the virtualization layer, which would be system-mode because it deals with higher privileges and hardware-level operations. This bug seems to involve memory addresses and cache handling, which are low-level functions.

Also, since this is within QEMU's core functionality, it likely affects how the emulator interacts with virtual devices or the underlying operating system, making it a system-mode issue.
