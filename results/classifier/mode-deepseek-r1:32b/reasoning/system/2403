Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this QEMU issue is user-mode or system-mode related. The problem happens when using the WHPX accelerator to boot Windows 7, which freezes at the starting screen. When they switch to TCG accelerator, it works fine.

Hmm, user-mode issues usually relate to applications running within the guest OS or how the CPU handles instructions in user space. System-mode tends to involve lower-level stuff like device drivers, hardware interactions, or the hypervisor's handling of virtualized resources.

In this case, the problem occurs during booting Windows 7, which is a system-level operation. The fact that it works with TCG but not WHPX suggests it might be related to how the accelerator interacts with the virtualized environment at a lower level. Maybe it's something in the hardware acceleration setup or device emulation.

Also, the linked issue on GitLab points to problems with Windows 7 and WHPX, which probably involves deeper system interactions rather than user applications. So I'm leaning towards system-mode because it's about booting and the hypervisor layer.
