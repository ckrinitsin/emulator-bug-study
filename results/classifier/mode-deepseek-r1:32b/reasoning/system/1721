Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this RabbitMQ issue is a user-mode or system-mode problem. Let's see.

The user mentioned they're using Docker on macOS with an M1 chip. They deleted all containers and images related to RabbitMQ and then tried starting it again with `docker compose up -d`, but the container stops with specific error messages.

Looking at the logs, I notice mentions of Erlang (since RabbitMQ is built with Erlang) and some specific processes like mnesia, which is a database system used by RabbitMQ. The key error seems to be a segmentation fault from QEMU: "qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped". 

I remember that segmentation faults usually indicate issues in low-level code, often related to memory access errors. Since this is happening within QEMU, which is part of the virtualization layer inside Docker, it might be a problem with how the Docker environment interacts with the host system's resources.

The user also mentioned that this started after deleting all containers and images. Maybe there was some leftover state or configuration causing conflicts. Or perhaps their Docker setup has changed since the last time RabbitMQ worked. 

Considering macOS and M1, there might be compatibility issues with certain versions of software. Docker on macOS runs in a virtual machine (using QEMU under the hood), so any issue here could be related to how that VM interacts with the host's hardware or drivers.

Since the error is from QEMU, which is part of the system infrastructure managing the Docker containers, and not directly from RabbitMQ or Erlang, this seems more like a system-mode problem. It involves lower-level processes, virtualization, and possibly interactions with hardware.
