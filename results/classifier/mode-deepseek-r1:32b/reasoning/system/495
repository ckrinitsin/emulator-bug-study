Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either user-mode or system-mode related. The error message mentions "sdhci" which stands for Secure Digital Host Controller Interface. SDHCI is typically part of the hardware drivers and deals with low-level operations like interacting with storage devices.

The issue seems to involve a problem with write protection groups, specifically an assertion failing because wpnum is not less than sd->wpgrps_size. This suggests it's dealing with memory management or device initialization at a lower level, which is usually handled in system-mode where higher privileges are required for device access and driver operations.

Since QEMU emulates hardware, issues within the SDHCI driver would relate to how the emulator interacts with virtualized devices, which falls under system-level functionality. Therefore, this bug is likely system-mode related.
