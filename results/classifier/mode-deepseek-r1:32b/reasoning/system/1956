Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue is updating the microvm documentation with an ACPI option. Let me think: user-mode usually involves application-level issues without needing high privileges. System-mode deals with lower-level stuff like hardware devices, OS interactions, etc.

ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is related to system power management and configuration, which interacts deeply with the operating system and hardware. Microvms might run in a more isolated environment, but adding an ACPI option would affect how the virtual machine interacts with system resources.

So, this seems to involve system-level changes or documentation updates because it's about how the VM handles power management and device configurations. Therefore, it's likely related to system-mode.
