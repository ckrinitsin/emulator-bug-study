Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether this bug in QEMU is user-mode or system-mode related. The issue mentions incorrect addresses for the pmpaddr13 and pmpaddr14 CSRs in lines 2119 and 2120 of qemu\disas\riscv.c.

First, I need to understand what these CSRs are. PMP stands for Physical Memory Protection, which is part of RISC-V's privilege model. These CSRs are used to configure the physical memory protection, allowing regions of physical memory to be protected against access by different privilege levels.

Since PMP is related to memory protection and privileges, it falls under system-level operations. System-mode in QEMU would handle these kinds of low-level configurations that affect how memory is accessed across different privilege levels, which is crucial for operating systems and device drivers.

The bug here is about the disassembler incorrectly mapping the addresses for pmpaddr13 and pmpaddr14. This could cause incorrect decoding of instructions or misreporting of these registers when debugging. If a debugger relies on correct register names, this mistake could lead to wrong analysis, which would impact system-level tasks rather than user applications.

Moreover, CSRs like pmpaddr are typically accessed in supervisor mode (S-mode) or machine mode (M-mode), which are higher privilege levels handled by the system software, not user-space programs. Therefore, any issue with their correct mapping affects how the system manages memory protection, which is a system-level concern.

In conclusion, this bug relates to system-mode because it involves low-level hardware configuration that's essential for operating systems and device management.
