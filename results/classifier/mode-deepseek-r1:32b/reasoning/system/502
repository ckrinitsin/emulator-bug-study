Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is that there's no mouse input possible in version 6.1.0-rc0. 

First, let me understand the context. QEMU can run in two modes: user mode and system mode. User-mode emulation runs processes on a host machine without needing hardware virtualization, while system-mode involves full virtualization of an operating system with its own kernel.

The problem here is about mouse input not working. Mouse handling typically relates to how the virtual machine interacts with peripherals. Since it's a regression in QEMU, which often deals with device emulation and drivers, this sounds like it might be at a lower level than just user applications. 

In system-mode, QEMU emulates devices like mice, keyboards, etc., so issues with peripheral input are more likely related to the virtual machine's hardware setup rather than any specific application running in user space. The fact that mouse input isn't working suggests there's an issue with how the device is being handled by the emulator.

Therefore, this bug is probably system-mode related because it involves a device (mouse) not functioning correctly within the virtual environment.
