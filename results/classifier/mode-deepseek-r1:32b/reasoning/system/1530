Alright, let's try to figure this out. The user is having an issue with SDL in Windows 10 where the window opens but shows a black screen, freezes, and then crashes. They've mentioned that when they run just `sdl`, it works fine, but adding `gtk,gl=on` gives an error about OpenGL not being supported by the display. 

They've tried different VGA options (`virtio` and `std`) without success. They also checked SVM settings (both on and off) since they're using an AMD Ryzen 2600x CPU. The project was built with configure enabling GTK, SDL, and OpenGL, and all checks passed as OK. Additionally, their system has OpenGL version 4.6.

Hmm, so the problem occurs when trying to use OpenGL alongside SDL and GTK in QEMU. Since it's a virtualization issue involving graphics drivers and possibly how QEMU handles OpenGL rendering under Windows, I think this relates more to system-mode operations because it involves device drivers, display settings, and possibly hardware acceleration features like SVM.
