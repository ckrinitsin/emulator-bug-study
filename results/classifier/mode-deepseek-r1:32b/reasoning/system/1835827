Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this bug is user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is that HTIF symbols are no longer recognized by the RISC-V Spike board. From what I remember, HTIF (High-Level Trace Interface) is used for debugging in RISC-V systems. 

The user mentioned a commit where `load_kernel()` was moved to `riscv_load_kernel()`, and this change excluded `htif_symbol_callback()`. That makes me think that the problem is related to how the kernel is being loaded, which probably involves system-level functions rather than user applications.

In RISC-V systems, Spike is a CPU model used for simulation. When dealing with HTIF symbols, it's typically part of the system setup because these symbols are necessary for things like debugging and communication between the simulator and the target system. If these symbols aren't recognized anymore, it could affect how the system initializes or interacts with peripherals or devices.

Since `load_kernel()` is involved, which sounds like a lower-level function responsible for booting the kernel, this seems to be at the system level. The fact that it's related to Spike and RISC-V suggests it's not just a user application issue but something deeper in the system setup or device interaction.

So putting it all together, this bug is likely system-mode related because it involves kernel loading, HTIF symbols for debugging, and interactions with the Spike board which are higher privilege tasks.
