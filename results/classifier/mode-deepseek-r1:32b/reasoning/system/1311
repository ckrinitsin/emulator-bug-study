Okay, I need to determine whether the bug report about "riscv-qemu can't record interrupt" is user-mode related or system-mode related. Let's break it down.

First, RISC-V is an instruction set architecture used in various systems, and QEMU is a popular emulator for testing different architectures. The issue here is that the emulator can't record interrupts, which are signals sent to the processor to indicate an event that needs attention.

Interrupts typically involve higher privilege levels because they require handling by the operating system or hardware devices. When a CPU receives an interrupt, it usually switches to a higher privilege mode (like supervisor or machine mode) to process it. This is handled at a low level, often involving device drivers or OS kernels.

Since the problem involves interrupts, which are part of the system's operation and involve changing processor modes and handling hardware events, this seems like a system-level issue. It probably relates to how QEMU emulates the RISC-V architecture's interrupt handling mechanisms, possibly interacting with virtualized devices or peripherals.

User-mode issues usually relate to application-level problems, but interrupts are more about the underlying system and hardware interaction. So, this bug is likely in system-mode.
