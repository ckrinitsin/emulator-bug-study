Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The user mentioned a text rendering issue in the file system/arm/cpu-features.html related to QEMU. Since it's about CPU features and likely involves lower-level operations like hardware interaction or device emulation, which are typical in system mode where higher privileges are involved, this should be a system-mode bug.
