Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether this bug report is related to user-mode or system-mode in QEMU. Let's see what the information given tells me.

The problem occurs when running a RTEMS test called psxndbm01.exe on AArch64-ilp32 using qemu-system-aarch64. The issue is a spurious data abort, which means an unexpected memory access error. The user provided some details about the exception: it's an ESR (Exception Syndrome Register) 0x25/0x96000010, which indicates a synchronous external abort.

Looking at the ESR fields, the EC is 0b100101 and ISS is 0b10000. From the ARMv8 manual, this means it's an external abort that wasn't during translation table walks or hardware updates. So it's a data access causing an external abort.

The command line shows they're using QEMU with various debugging options, including tracing instructions and guest errors. The test is failing on both QEMU 3.1.0 from Debian and 4.1 built by RTEMS.

Now, considering the classification: user-mode issues usually relate to code running in non-privileged mode (like applications), while system-mode involves higher privileges, hardware devices, MMU, etc.

In this case, the abort is happening during a data access that's supposed to have MMU and alignment checks disabled. Since MMU configuration and handling of such exceptions are part of the kernel or system setup, it suggests this is a problem in how QEMU handles system-level operations.

So, this seems like a system-mode issue because it involves memory management (MMU) which runs at higher privilege levels and interacts with hardware components. Therefore, the bug should be classified under 'system'.

The bug report indicates an issue with the MMU handling and data access in QEMU, which relates to system-level operations.
