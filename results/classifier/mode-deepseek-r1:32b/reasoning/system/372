Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is about indentation using spaces instead of tabs in the TCG / CPU subsystem. 

First, understanding what each mode handles: User-mode deals with applications running on top of the OS, while System-mode involves lower-level parts like hardware, device drivers, and the kernel.

The bug here mentions the TCG (Translation Container Group) and CPU subsystems. These are parts of QEMU that handle virtualization at a deeper level, not just application code. TCG is involved in translating machine code during emulation, which is a core part of how QEMU works with different architectures. This sounds like it's related to the system-level operations because it affects how the CPU is emulated and interacts with the hardware.

Indentation issues usually don't affect functionality but are more about coding style. However, since this is within the TCG/CPU subsystem, which is part of QEMU's core that deals with lower-level processes, it would fall under system-mode. This subsystem likely requires precise handling of code structure to ensure proper emulation, so using spaces instead of tabs might be a matter of consistency and correctness in that critical area.

Therefore, this bug report relates more to the system-mode as it pertains to the core functionality of QEMU's virtualization processes.
