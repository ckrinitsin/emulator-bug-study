Okay, I need to classify this bug report about qemu into either user-mode or system-mode. The issue is that the TCX emulation is missing a 1152x900 mode. Hmm, what does that mean?

TCX might refer to something related to hardware or device emulation. Since qemu emulates hardware devices like graphics cards, this sounds like it's about how qemu handles a specific display resolution. Display resolutions are typically handled at the system level because they involve graphical drivers and hardware emulations.

So if the TCX emulation is missing a mode, that suggests it's not just an application-level issue but something related to the underlying hardware setup in the emulator. This would fall under system-mode as it involves device emulation and higher privileges.
