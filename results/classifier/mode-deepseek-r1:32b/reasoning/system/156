Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue mentioned is that the documentation for "-nodefaults" is unclear. Let me think about what each term means.

User-mode typically involves software running without high privileges and interacts with hardware through system calls. System-mode issues usually involve higher privileges, peripherals, devices, or operating systems directly.

The "-nodefaults" option in QEMU is used to disable default device assignments. This affects how the virtual machine is set up at a lower level, which sounds like it's part of the system setup rather than user applications. So this seems more related to system-mode because it deals with VM configuration and hardware devices.

Therefore, I would classify this bug report as 'system'.

The issue relates to QEMU's handling of virtual machine configurations, specifically device assignments, which is a system-level concern.
