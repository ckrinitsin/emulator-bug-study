Okay, I need to classify this QEMU bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let me think through it step by step.

First, the problem is about WHPX not enabling x86_64v3 instructions in a guest. That sounds like a virtualization issue because WHPX (Whisker) is related to performance for certain guests.

The user provides steps that involve running commands in a terminal, specifically using ld.so to check instruction set availability. They mention that this affects Linux distributions like CentOS Stream 10's ability to boot with WHPX enabled.

I remember that system-mode issues typically relate to higher-privilege operations, peripherals, devices, and the OS itself. Since this problem is about the guest OS not booting correctly due to missing instruction support in QEMU's virtualization layer, it seems related to how the hypervisor or device emulation is handling instructions.

Also, WHPX is a paravirtualized accelerator for Windows guests on Linux hosts, so any issues here would affect system-level operations within the guest OS. Therefore, this isn't just an application (user-mode) problem but rather how the virtualized environment is set up and interacts with the host.

So, putting it all together, I think this bug falls under 'system-mode' because it involves the operating system's interaction with virtualized hardware.
