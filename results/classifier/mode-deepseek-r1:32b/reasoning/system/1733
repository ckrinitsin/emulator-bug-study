Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is with the PMP_is_locked function having a redundant top pmp check.

PMP stands for Physical Memory Protection, which is part of RISC-V architecture. It's used to control memory permissions and is typically managed in system mode because it deals with hardware-level memory protection, affecting how different parts of the system access memory. Since this involves lower-level operations and higher privileges (like kernel or hypervisor level), it seems related to system-mode.

The function PMP_is_locked suggests it's checking whether a certain physical memory region is locked, which would be important for security and isolation in a virtualized environment. These checks are usually performed by the operating system or hypervisor, not user applications.

Given that, this bug is likely in the system-mode code within QEMU because it deals with hardware features that require higher privileges and affect the overall system's memory management.
