Okay, so I need to figure out whether this Alpine Linux crypto issue on QEMU 4.0 is a user-mode or system-mode problem. Let me think through the details.

The user reports that when they boot an Alpine Linux netboot image using QEMU 4.0, the installation fails with "BAD SIGNATURE" errors for various packages. They also mention that if they use a disk image from a previous QEMU version, crypto operations like using openssl fail as well. This doesn't happen on earlier QEMU versions or other architectures.

Hmm, so what's different about QEMU 4.0? I know that QEMU can run in user mode and system mode. User-mode is when it runs without requiring kernel-level privileges, typically used for running processes in a sandboxed environment. System-mode involves full virtualization, handling lower-level tasks like device emulation and hardware access.

In this case, the issue seems related to cryptographic operations failing during package installation and after booting. The fact that it's about signatures suggests something is wrong with how encryption or signing is handled. Since the error occurs both in the netboot setup and when using a disk image from an older QEMU version on QEMU 4.0, it points towards a problem within QEMU itself rather than the Alpine Linux setup.

Considering that crypto operations are failing during installation, which involves verifying package signatures, this might be related to how QEMU handles cryptographic instructions or whether certain hardware extensions (like AES-NI) are being passed through correctly. If QEMU is in system mode and not properly emulating or passing through these instructions, it could cause the crypto functions to fail.

Also, since the user didn't see this issue on other architectures with QEMU 4.0, it might be specific to how ppc64le is handled in this version. System-mode issues often involve device emulation or hardware interactions, so if there's a problem with how the CPU or certain instructions are being emulated, that could affect cryptographic operations.

Putting it together: The failure is during system boot and package installation, which involves low-level operations managed by QEMU in system mode. Therefore, this seems like a system-mode related issue.
