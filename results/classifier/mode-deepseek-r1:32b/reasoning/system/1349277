Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this bug report is classified as user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is about the AArch64 emulation in QEMU ignoring SPSel=0 when taking or returning from exceptions at EL1 or higher. 

From what I remember, exception levels (ELs) in ARM architecture determine privilege levels. EL0 is the lowest, typically for user applications, and higher ELs like EL1 are used by the operating system kernel. In this case, the problem occurs when dealing with threads running at EL1t, which I think stands for thread mode at EL1. The context switching happens at EL1h, which might be hypervisor mode.

The user is working on a toy OS that's doing preemptive multithreading between these EL1t threads. They're experiencing stack pointer corruption because the emulator isn't handling SPSel correctly when entering or returning from exceptions. Since SPSel=0 usually selects the EL1 stack pointer, if it's ignored, the wrong SP might be used, leading to issues.

Now, considering whether this is user-mode or system-mode: User-mode issues typically involve applications running at EL0 without needing higher privileges. System-mode issues involve kernel-level operations, device drivers, peripherals, and OS functions that require higher privilege levels like EL1 or above.

In this case, the bug occurs when handling exceptions in EL1t and returning to EL1h, which are both system-level exception modes. The problem is related to how the stack pointers are managed during context switches at these higher privilege levels. This sounds like it's affecting the OS's ability to manage threads correctly, which is a system-mode function.

Therefore, this bug report is likely system-mode related.
