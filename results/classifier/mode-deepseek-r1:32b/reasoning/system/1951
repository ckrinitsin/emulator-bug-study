Alright, let's try to figure out whether this issue is user-mode or system-mode related. The problem is that when running QEMU as a normal user on macOS, the PlutoSDR USB device isn't working properly in the VM. Instead of appearing correctly, it fails with some errors about USB configuration.

First, I remember that in Unix-like systems, certain operations require root privileges because they involve accessing hardware directly or modifying kernel-level configurations. USB devices often fall into this category since they interact with low-level drivers and system resources.

Looking at the error messages, there are a lot of libusbDetachKernelDriver errors with ACCESS issues. This suggests that QEMU is trying to detach the kernel driver from the USB device but doesn't have the necessary permissions. On macOS, which is based on BSD, accessing hardware devices typically requires root privileges because the system enforces strict security policies around such operations.

The user tried running QEMU as a regular user and encountered these issues, but when they ran it with sudo (as root), the device worked correctly. This points towards a permissions problem where QEMU needs elevated privileges to properly manage the USB device in the VM.

Additionally, the PlutoSDR is more complex than a simple RTL-SDR device, which might require more extensive interaction with the system's USB stack. The simpler device works without root because it doesn't need as much low-level access or driver manipulation.

I also recall that QEMU uses libusb for handling USB devices in virtual machines. If the QEMU build isn't configured properly with the right entitlements on macOS, it might not have the necessary permissions to interact with certain devices even when run as a user, hence requiring root access to bypass these restrictions.

Putting this all together, the issue revolves around accessing hardware resources (USB device) which requires system-level privileges. Therefore, this is likely a system-mode related problem.
