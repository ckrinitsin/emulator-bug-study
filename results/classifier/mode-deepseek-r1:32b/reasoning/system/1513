Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The report mentions CPU flags being better documented. So, what's the context here?

QEMU is an emulator that can run in both user mode and system mode. User-mode emulation typically deals with running applications without a full OS, while system-mode involves emulating the entire system, including hardware devices.

CPU flags are part of the processor configuration, which affects how the CPU operates. Documenting these would likely involve understanding how QEMU handles low-level operations, which ties into system emulation because it's about the underlying hardware setup.

Since the issue is about documentation related to CPU functionality that probably impacts the entire system's operation, this falls under system-mode. Itâ€™s not just an application-level concern but rather a deeper system configuration aspect.
