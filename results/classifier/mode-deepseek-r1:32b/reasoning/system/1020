Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. Let me read through the problem description again.

The issue is about double lines appearing on a VGA display in mode 0x06 when using a specific script with qemu. The user provided steps where they set up the video mode via int 0x10 and then put data into video RAM using a Python script. They also mentioned that this doesn't happen in mode 0x05.

So, the problem involves how the display is rendering, specifically with lines doubling. This kind of issue likely relates to how the graphics hardware is being handled by the emulator (qemu). Since it's about display modes and video RAM access, which are lower-level operations, it seems like a system-mode issue because it's dealing with device handling and possibly hardware emulation.

Moreover, the fact that running the same script under 86Box works correctly suggests that qemu might be mishandling the VGA mode setup or the way data is written to the video RAM. Emulators at this level operate in system mode as they interact directly with virtualized devices and peripherals.

Therefore, classifying this as a system-mode related bug makes sense because it involves device drivers, hardware emulation, and lower-level interactions.
