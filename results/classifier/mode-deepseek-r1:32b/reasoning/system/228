Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue mentions "TCG test targets missing from 'make check-help'". TCG is the Translation Cache Generator used by QEMU for emulating CPU instructions. Since testing in QEMU involves various components like device emulation and OS-level operations, this sounds more like it's part of the system being emulated rather than user-mode applications. Therefore, it likely falls under system-mode.
