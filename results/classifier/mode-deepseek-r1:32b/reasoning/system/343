Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is that madvise reports success but doesn't implement WIPEONFORK. 

Madvise is a function in Linux used for memory management advice. It suggests how the kernel should manage pages of memory. The MADV_WIPEONFORK option tells the kernel to clear pages when they are forked, which is related to process creation and memory handling.

QEMU is an emulator that can run different guest operating systems. When dealing with processes, especially in system emulation, it's likely interacting with lower-level operations like process forking and memory management, which are handled by the OS kernel. These operations require higher privileges because they involve managing processes and memory at a deep level.

Since this issue involves how QEMU interacts with memory and process creation, which are core system functions requiring privileged access, it falls under system-mode.
