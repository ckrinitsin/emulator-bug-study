Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let's see what the user is dealing with.

They're trying to build QEMU in a static way on macOS for both amd64 and arm64 targets. They mentioned that Podman uses QEMU on macOS and the team has dynamically compiled it before, but now they want static. 

Static compilation usually involves linking everything into one binary without external libraries, which can be tricky because of dependencies. On macOS, compiling statically can have issues with system libraries and frameworks.

The user is asking if QEMU supports static compilation on macOS. From what I know, QEMU's 'system-mode' (which emulates entire systems) often requires more low-level access and might rely on dynamic linking for certain features or device support. 'User-mode' tends to run userspace programs without full OS emulation.

The problem here is about building the x86_64-softmmu target, which I believe is a system emulator. SoftMMU suggests it's using software MMU, typical in system emulation. 

Since static compilation of system-mode QEMU on macOS isn't straightforward and may not be supported due to dependencies on dynamic libraries or macOS-specific frameworks, this bug is more about the system-mode setup.
