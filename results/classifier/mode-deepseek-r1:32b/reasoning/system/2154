Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this bug report is related to user mode or system mode in QEMU. The problem described involves the ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1 register returning all zeros when read using the mrs instruction. This register is part of the AArch64 architecture and contains feature information, specifically for things like small translation tables (FEAT_TTST).

From what I understand, system registers in AArch64 are typically accessible only in certain privilege levels. ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1 is an EL1 register, which means it's accessible from the exception level 1, usually corresponding to kernel mode or higher-privilege states.

The user reported that they're reading this register within QEMU using mrs x[n], ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1 and getting all zeros. They mentioned that FEAT_TTST is a new feature causing issues and that QEMU has supposedly implemented it, but the problem persists.

Now, considering whether this is a user-mode or system-mode issue: User mode in AArch64 typically runs at EL0, which doesn't have direct access to many system registers. System registers like ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1 are usually read and written by the operating system kernel or hypervisors in higher exception levels.

Since the register is being accessed and is returning incorrect values, it suggests that the problem lies within QEMU's emulation of these system-level features. This would affect how the guest OS interacts with the virtualized environment, particularly regarding memory management features like small translation tables.

Therefore, this issue seems to be related to system-mode operations because it involves the handling of system registers and features that are crucial for the proper functioning of the operating system in a virtualized environment.
