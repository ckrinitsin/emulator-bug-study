Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user' or 'system'. Let me look at the problem description.

The issue is about qemu's vhost-user-test outputting scary messages when run in verbose mode. The logs show errors like "vhost VQ 0 ring restore failed" and "Invalid argument (22)".

Vhost-user is a QEMU feature that allows user space applications to directly access virtualization hardware, so it operates at a lower level than regular user processes. This seems related to how QEMU interacts with the kernel or device drivers because vhost requires specific kernel support.

The errors mention things like setting msg fds and ring restore failures, which are low-level operations typically handled by system components. The fact that it's about vhost_net suggests it's dealing with network devices in a virtualized environment, which is more of a system-level concern.

So, since this involves lower-level interactions with hardware and kernel features, I think it falls under 'system-mode' related issues.
