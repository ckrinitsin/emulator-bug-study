Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into either user-mode or system-mode. The issue is that the bFLT parser doesn't select MMU-less CPU. Hmm, what's the context here?

bFLT stands for Binary Floating-Point Load/Store, which relates to how floating-point operations are handled in an emulator like QEMU. The mention of MMU-less CPU suggests that the problem occurs when running on a CPU without a Memory Management Unit.

QEMU can run in two main modes: user-mode and system-mode. User-mode emulates just the CPU and allows running user-space applications, while system-mode emulates entire systems including hardware devices and peripherals, often with higher privileges since it runs at a lower level.

Since this issue is about the parser not selecting an MMU-less CPU, it seems related to how the emulator initializes or selects CPUs without an MMU. This sounds like it's deeper in the system setup rather than just running user applications. Also, MMUs are part of the hardware emulation which falls under system-mode where QEMU handles more complex setups including device and OS-level interactions.

Therefore, this bug is likely related to system-mode because it involves lower-level CPU selection and hardware emulations that aren't part of user-mode's scope.
