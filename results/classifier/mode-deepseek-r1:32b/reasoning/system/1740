Okay, so I need to classify this QEMU bug as either user-mode or system-mode related. Let's break down the information provided.

The problem occurs when running a Cortex-M board simulation in QEMU. The issue is that when an exception should be raised (like a prefetch abort), QEMU aborts instead of handling it properly. Looking at the stack trace, I see functions like arm_deliver_fault and compute_fsr_fsc, which are related to how exceptions are handled in ARM CPUs.

The error message mentions an assertion failure in the function arm_is_secure_below_el3. The line checks if the CPU has the ARM_FEATURE_M (which is for Cortex-M processors) and then proceeds under the assumption that it's not present. But in this case, it is a Cortex-M board, so the condition fails.

Now, thinking about system-mode vs user-mode: System-mode issues often involve higher privilege levels, handling exceptions, and interacting with devices or peripherals. Since this problem arises during exception delivery (handling faults), which is part of the CPU's privileged operations, it seems related to how QEMU manages exceptions in a secure context for Cortex-M.

The assertion failure suggests that there might be an incorrect assumption about the security state when processing exceptions. This would fall under system-level handling because it involves the CPU's exception vectors and secure/non-secure states, which are part of the system management rather than user applications.

So putting this together, this bug is related to how QEMU handles exceptions in a Cortex-M environment at a low level, involving security states and privilege levels. Therefore, it should be classified as a system-mode issue.
