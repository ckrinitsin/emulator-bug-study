Okay, so I need to classify this bug report regarding QEMU as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The report mentions "MigrationCapability" with "dirty-bitmaps off". Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what that means, but let me think.

QEMU is a versatile emulator that can run in different modes. User mode typically refers to running applications without full system emulation, which might involve things like process isolation or specific application behaviors. System mode, on the other hand, involves emulating an entire operating system, including peripherals and higher-privilege operations.

The term "dirty-bitmaps" sounds technical. I remember that in virtualization, dirty bitmaps are used to track changes made to memory pages so they can be efficiently migrated during live migration. This is a feature related to how the hypervisor or emulator handles memory, which would involve lower-level system operations rather than user applications.

So when a bug report talks about migrating capabilities and dirty bitmaps being off, it's likely dealing with the underlying system emulation aspects of QEMU. Therefore, this should fall under 'system-mode'.
