Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bug report mentioning an EFI stub error about a 64 KB granular kernel not being supported by the CPU. They want me to classify it as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'.

Hmm, user-mode issues usually relate to applications running without needing high privileges. System-mode involves lower-level stuff like hardware, drivers, and OS components.

The error is about the EFI stub and the CPU's support for a kernel granule size. That sounds like something at a very low level, probably during boot or kernel loading. Since EFI is part of the firmware that starts the OS, this must be system-mode related.
