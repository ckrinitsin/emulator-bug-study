Alright, let's try to figure out whether this bug report is about user-mode or system-mode issues in QEMU.

The user is talking about running legacy operating systems on foreign CPU platforms, like emulating m68 on Intel or Intel on ARM. They're concerned that QEMU isn't sufficiently focused on emulation (the 'emu' part) and is too reliant on virtualization features like KVM, which might not work for their needs as more platforms switch to different architectures, such as Apple moving to ARM.

They ran into issues when trying to emulate an older CPU (Penryn) with specific flags using QEMU's TCG. The errors indicate that TCG doesn't support certain CPU features required for macOS on an ARM-based Mac. They propose that QEMU should ensure CPUs can be fully handled by TCG without relying on KVM, and there should be clear documentation about which CPUs require KVM.

So, the issue is related to CPU emulation capabilities within QEMU's system-mode, where it handles virtualized systems and hardware devices. The problem isn't in user applications but in the lower-level system emulations, like CPU instruction sets and features that are crucial for running different OS versions.

Therefore, this bug report is about system-mode functionality.
