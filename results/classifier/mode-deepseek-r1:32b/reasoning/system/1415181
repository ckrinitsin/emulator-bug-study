Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this bug report is user-mode or system-mode related. The user is on a Windows tablet that doesn't allow USB booting. They want to access raw partitions to run Linux installers using QEMU and have successfully installed several boot loaders via UEFI.

Hmm, accessing raw partitions typically involves lower-level operations because partitions are part of the disk storage managed by the operating system. That sounds like it requires higher privileges, which makes me think of system-mode. Also, dealing with UEFI and installing boot loaders touches on hardware firmware and device management, which is definitely system-level stuff.

QEMU itself can run in user mode for virtualization, but accessing raw partitions might need kernel or driver support to get direct access. So the issue here likely involves how QEMU interacts with the underlying system resources, not just running an application as a regular user.

Putting it all together, this seems more about interacting with system-level components like disks and UEFI rather than a user-space application problem.
