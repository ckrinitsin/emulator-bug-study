Okay, I need to determine whether this bug report is classified as 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let me read through the details provided.

The user is having trouble booting a Cirros VM using QEMU 2.6.0 and libvirt 2.0.0 in TCG mode. The VM gets stuck at "Starting up...". They've tried both a Cirros image and CentOS, both failing similarly. 

Looking at the command line used, it's invoking qemu-kvm with various parameters including machine type, CPU, memory, devices like virtio-blk-pci, and network interfaces. The issue seems to be during VM bootup, which involves initializing hardware components emulated by QEMU.

TCG mode refers to using the TCG accelerator in QEMU for virtualization without KVM support. This affects how the virtual CPU is handled. Since it's a minimal Linux image failing, it might relate to how the kernel interacts with the virtualized environment.

The problem involves lower-level system components like device emulation, boot process, and hardware initialization. These aspects are typically part of the system-mode operation because they deal with emulating hardware and the interaction between the guest OS and the hypervisor/QEMU setup.

Libvirt logs might show issues related to how libvirt interacts with QEMU or the underlying hypervisor, which is a higher-level component but still tied to system operations.

In summary, since the issue involves booting a VM and interacting with virtual hardware, it's more likely a system-mode problem.
