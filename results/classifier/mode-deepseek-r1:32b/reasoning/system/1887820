Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue is about the TCG tests not being listed in 'make check-help', which affects how users run these tests.

First, I'll think about what TCG does. TCG stands for Tiny Code Generator, and it's used by QEMU to translate machine code from one architecture to another efficiently. This sounds like a low-level function, typically handled at the system level because it involves emulation of hardware instructions.

The report mentions running tests using 'make run-tcg-tests-$TARGET-softmmu'. The '-softmmu' part suggests that this is related to software MMU (Memory Management Unit) which is a component used in full system emulation. Full system emulation typically falls under system-mode because it involves simulating an entire computer environment, including devices and peripherals.

Moreover, 'make check-help' lists available checks, so if TCG tests are missing here, it's about the structure of how QEMU runs its test suite. If this were user-mode, it might involve processes or applications without full system emulation, but since it's about TCG which is core to system-level operations, it makes sense as a system-mode issue.

So, putting it together, the bug affects the availability of TCG tests in the help output, and given that TCG is part of QEMU's system emulation, this should be classified under 'system'.
