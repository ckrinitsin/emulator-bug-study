Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue is that a guest freezes until there's keyboard input on the Windows version. Let me think about what each mode involves.

User-mode issues usually relate to applications running in user space without needing high privileges. They might involve problems with GUIs, application crashes, or things like networking from an app perspective.

System-mode issues are more about lower-level stuff, like device drivers, hardware interactions, operating system functions, and higher privileges. This would include booting processes, VMs interacting with hardware, and virtualization aspects.

In this case, the problem is with a guest OS in QEMU freezing until keyboard input. That sounds like it's related to how the virtual machine is handling input or possibly interacting with hardware. Since QEMU deals with virtualizing devices, including input devices, this seems more system-level. It might involve drivers, device emulation, or how the VM initializes before user interaction.

So, considering that virtualization and guest OS behavior under QEMU are typically handled at a lower level, I think this falls under 'system-mode'.
