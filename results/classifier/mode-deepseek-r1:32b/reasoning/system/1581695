Okay, so I'm trying to help someone who's running into issues when using Docker on their Ubuntu 14.04 x64 machine with a Raspberry Pi ARM container. The specific error they're encountering is "getifaddrs: Address family not supported by protocol" and "Cannot open netlink socket: Address family not supported by protocol" when they run the `ip addr` command inside the container.

Let me break this down. They're using `docker run` with a volume mount for `/usr/bin/qemu-arm-static`, which suggests they're setting up QEMU for ARM emulation. The image they're pulling is `philipz/rpi-raspbian:latest`. So, it's a Raspberry Pi Raspbian image running inside a Docker container on an x86_64 host.

The error occurs when trying to use the `ip addr` command. This makes me think there might be issues with how networking is set up within the container or perhaps something related to the QEMU setup. The error message mentions that the address family isn't supported, which could relate to the way network sockets are handled in the emulation.

They also mention they're working with an embedded ARM distro without a package manager, so any solution should avoid relying on `apt-get` or similar tools. That's important because it limits the possible fixes we can suggest.

Now, thinking about QEMU and Docker, when you run an ARM container on an x86 host, QEMU handles the binary translation. Sometimes, certain system calls or networking features might not be properly emulated, leading to issues like this.

I recall that in some cases, especially with older versions of Docker or specific setups, the network namespace handling can cause problems. The `ip` command uses netlink sockets for communication, and if those aren't correctly set up in the container's environment, it could lead to errors.

Another angle is the compatibility of the `philipz/rpi-raspbian` image with their setup. Maybe this image expects certain kernel features or configurations that are missing on their Ubuntu 14.04 system when running under QEMU.

I should also consider whether there's a known issue with Docker and ARM containers regarding network tools like `ip`. Perhaps updating Docker, using a different base image, or adjusting the container's networking configuration could help.

Since they can't use apt-get, maybe looking into static binaries or alternative commands that don't rely on netlink sockets could be a workaround. For example, using `ifconfig` instead of `ip addr` if it works in their environment.

Alternatively, checking if there are any specific kernel modules needed for ARM emulation that might not be loaded could be another step. But without package management, installing new modules might be tricky.

Overall, this seems like a system-level issue because it's related to how the container interacts with networking at a low level, possibly involving kernel or QEMU settings.
