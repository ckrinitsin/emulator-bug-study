Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related for QEMU. The issue is about the '-cpu <whatever>,help' option not printing available CPU types. From what I know, QEMU's CPU handling involves emulating different processors and their features. When you use '-cpu help', it lists supported CPUs, which relates to how the virtual machine's processor is configured.

This seems more like a system-level configuration because it deals with hardware emulation, which is part of the system-mode operations in QEMU. It doesn't involve user applications running inside the VM but rather the setup and available options for the CPU itself, which affects the entire system's behavior. Therefore, this bug is likely related to system mode.

The issue pertains to CPU configuration options within QEMU, affecting how the virtual machine is set up at a hardware level. This falls under system-mode as it relates to device emulation and higher-privilege operations.
