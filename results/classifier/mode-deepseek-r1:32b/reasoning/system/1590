Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this bug is user-mode or system-mode related. The problem is that ARMv8M secure mode debugging isn't working in QEMU starting from version 7.2.0. Before that, it was working fine with version 7.1.0.

Looking at the logs, when using GDB to debug with QEMU v7.2.0, there are mismatches in sections and memory access errors. The semihosting output isn't showing up either. In the successful session on a newer commit, everything aligns correctly, but not in 7.2.0.

The .gdbinit file sets the architecture to armv8-m.main and connects to QEMU via extended-remote. The issue seems to be with how QEMU handles secure mode debugging after a certain commit. The problem might involve memory mappings or section mismatches that affect debug operations, which could relate to system-level functions.

Since ARMv8M secure mode involves higher privileges and possibly device-specific configurations, this points towards system-mode issues. Debugging in secure mode requires correct handling of privileged instructions and memory areas, which are part of the system architecture.

So, I think this bug is related to system-mode because it's about debugging within a secure environment that has higher privileges and specific hardware interactions.
