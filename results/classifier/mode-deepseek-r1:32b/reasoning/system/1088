Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this QEMU 7.0.0 bug report is related to user-mode or system-mode. The issue is that the linker doesn't support --dynamic-list when building QEMU. Let me think about what each mode entails.

QEMU can run in both user-mode and system-mode. User-mode emulates individual applications, while system-mode emulates entire systems, including hardware devices and peripherals. 

The problem here is about linking during the build process. Since it's a build issue with the linker, I suspect it might be related to how QEMU is compiled. System-mode typically involves more complex setups, possibly requiring specific linker options for dynamic libraries or modules. If the linker doesn't support a certain option, it could prevent the system-mode components from building properly.

User-mode usually deals with running applications without full system emulation, so maybe the build process isn't as dependent on such linker features in that context. But I'm not entirely sure because build configurations can vary. However, given that --dynamic-list might be used for loading modules or handling dynamic linking in a more comprehensive way, it's likely part of the system-mode setup.

So, considering all this, I think the bug is related to system-mode.
