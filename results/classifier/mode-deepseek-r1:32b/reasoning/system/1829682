Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user' or 'system' mode related. The user is reporting that when they try to boot AIX 7.2 TL 2 SP 2 using QEMU version git (a5b428e) built on Debian, the system fails with a Data Storage Interrupt - PROC error. This didn't happen when using QEMU 3.1.0.

Looking at the details: they're using the pseries machine type, Power7 CPU, Virtio SCSI for storage. The boot process seems to fail during kernel loading or initialization. The error message "Data Storage Interrupt" suggests a problem with memory access, which is low-level and likely related to hardware emulation.

Since this involves virtualized hardware (SCSI device, CPU), it's more about the system-mode components of QEMU. These parts handle lower-level operations like device emulation and memory management, which are critical for booting an OS.

So, this bug affects how the guest OS interacts with the emulated hardware, pointing to a system-mode issue.
