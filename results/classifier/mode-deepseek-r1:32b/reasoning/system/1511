Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The user is asking for a CPU model related to ABI versions for x86_64 and i386 according to the x86-64 psABI. 

First, understanding the terms: ABI stands for Application Binary Interface, which defines how different parts of software interact with each other. The x86-64 psABI is a specific standard that outlines this for 64-bit systems. 

QEMU can run in two modes: user mode and system mode. User-mode QEMU emulates the CPU and runs applications without a full OS, translating syscalls as needed. System-mode QEMU emulates an entire computer, including hardware peripherals, devices, and a full operating system.

The bug report is about setting up the right CPU model for these ABIs. Since it's dealing with CPU models and possibly how the system calls are handled across different architectures (x86_64 and i386), this seems more related to how the OS interacts with the hardware. This makes me think it's a system-level issue because it involves the ABI which affects how system calls and libraries interactâ€”something that happens at the OS level.

Therefore, I classify this as 'system-mode' because it relates to higher-privilege operations and operating systems.

The bug report is about setting up CPU models for ABIs in x86_64 and i386, which pertains to how the system handles these interfaces at a low level. This involves system-level interactions and operating systems.
