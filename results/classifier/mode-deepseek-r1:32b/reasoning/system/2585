Okay, I'm trying to classify this QEMU bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. Let's look at the details provided.

The issue is about highmem support being broken in qemu-system-arm when using TCG (which is part of QEMU's system emulator). The problem involves commits that affect LPAE block descriptors and page table walking, which are related to memory management in virtualized environments.

Key points:
- Highmem support: This typically relates to how the virtual machine handles large amounts of physical memory.
- qemu-system-arm: This is a system emulator for ARM architecture, so it's about running entire OSes or hardware setups.
- TCG (Translation Control Graph) is used for emulating instructions in QEMU, which operates at the system level.

The bug seems to affect how page tables are walked and translated, which are low-level operations that impact the virtual machine's ability to run correctly. This includes handling higher privilege levels and device mappings, which are part of the system-mode functionality.

So, considering all this, it's a system-mode issue.
