Okay, I need to figure out whether this issue is user-mode or system-mode related. The user is having trouble accessing the internet from their guest OS running on QEMU. They can SSH into both the host and guest, but when they try to use wget or dnf, it fails with connection refused or network unreachable.

Let me think about what could cause this. Since SSH works between the host and guest, that suggests that basic networking is set up correctly. Maybe there's something specific about internet access through QEMU. 

I remember that in QEMU, there are different ways to configure networking for guests. One common setup uses user-mode networking where the guest connects via a NAT. Another is system-mode where the network is bridged or uses TAP devices for more direct access.

The error messages mention connection refused and network unreachable. These could indicate issues with firewall settings on either the host or guest, or maybe routing problems. But since it's happening across different protocols (HTTP over port 80), it might be a broader issue than just a specific service not running.

If this was a user-mode issue, perhaps adjusting NAT settings or firewall rules would help. If it's system-mode, maybe the network bridge isn't configured properly, or there are missing routes in the guest OS.

I should consider how the QEMU virtual network is set up. If they're using the default user-mode networking (like -netdev user), sometimes port forwarding needs to be correctly configured. Alternatively, if it's supposed to use a system-mode setup with a TAP device, maybe there's an issue with that configuration.

Another angle: Maybe DNS isn't working in the guest OS. If they can ping by IP but not domain names, that would point towards DNS issues. However, the user didn't mention trying pinging; they tried wget which uses DNS but also could fail if the port is blocked.

Wait, the user says they're using QEMU, so perhaps it's a matter of how the network interface is set up in the VM. If it's not getting an IP address from DHCP or isn't correctly configured for internet access through the host's connection.

In summary, since the issue pertains to network connectivity beyond SSH and involves the guest OS's ability to reach external resources, this seems like a system-mode problem because it relates to networking devices and configurations that are more hardware-level in nature. User-mode would be more about application-specific issues, but this is about the entire network stack not functioning as expected.
