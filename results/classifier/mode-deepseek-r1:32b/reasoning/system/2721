Okay, so I need to figure out whether this bug report is related to user-mode or system-mode in QEMU. The error message says "Failure with macOS 15.2 on ARM64: Property 'host-arm-cpu.sme' not found." 

First, let's break down the components here. QEMU can run in both user mode and system mode. User-mode emulation typically involves running a single process without a full OS, while system-mode runs an entire operating system with all its services.

The error mentions macOS 15.2 on ARM64, which suggests that it's dealing with hardware virtualization or system-level operations because macOS is the host OS here. The property 'host-arm-cpu.sme' not foundâ€”SME usually stands for Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) in ARM contexts. Maybe this relates to CPU features required by the virtualized environment.

Since the issue occurs on macOS, which is a higher privilege environment when running VMs, and it's about a missing property related to ARM CPU features, this likely pertains to system-mode because it involves the host's CPU capabilities needed for running a full OS in a VM. So I think it's a system-mode issue.
