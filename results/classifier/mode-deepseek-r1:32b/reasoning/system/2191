Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue is about exposing exports based on authentication. 

First, let me think about what each mode entails. User-mode deals with processes and applications running under a user's privileges, without needing high-level access. System-mode involves higher privileges, peripherals, devices, and the OS itself.

Exposing exports related to authentication likely touches deeper parts of the system, like how QEMU interacts with device drivers or handles security at a lower level. Authentication could involve kernel modules or system services, which are part of the system's core functionality. So this seems more aligned with system-mode because it affects higher-level privileges and possibly hardware interactions.

I don't think this is about user applications; it's probably related to how QEMU manages authentication in its virtualized environment, which would be a system-level concern.
