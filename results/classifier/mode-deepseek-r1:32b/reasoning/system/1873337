Okay, so I need to figure out whether this QEMU issue is a user-mode or system-mode problem. The user is having trouble where arrow key presses are doubled in certain DOS programs like file managers and scandisk when using QEMU. They provided a link to a GIF showing the problem.

First, I should understand what causes arrow keys to be double-pressed. Arrow keys send specific control sequences to the program. If these sequences are being sent twice, it might be an issue with how input is handled in the emulator.

QEMU emulates hardware, so if it's mishandling keyboard input at a low level, that could affect all programs running in the DOS environment. Since this happens across multiple applications (file managers, scandisk), it's not specific to any particular user-space application but rather a problem with how the system is handling inputs.

This suggests it's related to how QEMU interacts with the virtual hardware, specifically the keyboard controller. It might be processing key events incorrectly at the system level, leading to double presses being registered by the DOS programs.

Since it's about input handling and low-level emulation, this would fall under system-mode issues because it affects the interaction between the emulator (acting as a hardware layer) and the operating system running within it.
