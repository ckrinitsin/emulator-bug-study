Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The user is talking about adding support for a specific resolution (1366x768) in the -vga std output of QEMU. 

From what I know, QEMU has different modes: user mode and system mode. User mode is for running programs without a full OS, while system mode emulates an entire computer with its own OS.

The issue mentions modifying the VGA output, which relates to how graphics are displayed in the virtual machine. This seems like it's about the hardware emulation, specifically the video device settings. Since this involves setting up display resolutions and possibly interacting with the host's display drivers or system resources, it's more on the system side.

Also, looking at the Debian bug link from 2013 and the 2024 thread on qemu-discuss, these discussions are likely about QEMU's system-mode features because they're talking about VGA modes that affect how an operating system runs within a VM. 

So, considering all this, the problem is related to the system-mode aspect of QEMU.
