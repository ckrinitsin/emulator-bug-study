Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user is having trouble running SunOS 4.1.4 in QEMU version 6.0.0 and above. The main issue occurs when booting from a SCSI disk, which causes errors and prevents the OS from starting properly. They've traced this to a specific commit in QEMU's esp.c driver.

Additionally, they mention issues with CD-ROM block sizes and an audio device causing a panic on SPARCstation 20 configurations. The user also provides patches for these problems but isn't sure if they're correct.

Looking at the components involved: the bug affects how the OS interacts with SCSI devices, which is part of the hardware emulation in QEMU. This includes drivers like esp.c and sun4m.c, as well as device handling in scsi-disk.c. These are all system-level components that require kernel or firmware interaction.

Since the issues involve low-level device drivers and hardware emulation, they fall under the 'system-mode' category. User-mode bugs would typically relate to applications running on top of the OS, not the underlying hardware or device drivers.
