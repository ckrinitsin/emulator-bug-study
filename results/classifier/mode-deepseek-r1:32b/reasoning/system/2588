Alright, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. Let's start by understanding the problem described.

The issue is about QEMU regression where the NonSecure World can change Secure World MMU mappings. This affects how the MMU tables are set up in different execution contexts. The user provided steps involve building and running specific software, which includes setting up a secure environment using GoTEE-example and Tamago.

Looking at the components involved: the problem relates to the MMU configuration between Secure and NonSecure worlds. This involves low-level hardware interactions, specifically how memory translation tables are managed in different privilege levels. The MMU is part of the CPU's system architecture, handling address translations which are critical for system stability and security.

The fact that this impacts both secure and non-secure execution contexts suggests it's a lower-level issue. It's not something that would typically affect user applications directly but rather the underlying system that manages hardware resources.

Additionally, the steps to reproduce involve setting up a trusted OS and executing code in different privilege modes (Secure vs NonSecure). This is more about how the system handles these modes rather than any user application functionality.

Therefore, this bug seems to be related to how QEMU emulates the system's secure and non-secure states, which falls under system-mode operations. It involves higher privileges, possibly device drivers or firmware interactions, and affects the overall system behavior rather than a specific user process.
