Okay, I need to figure out whether this bug report about QBASIC not working in graphics modes is a user-mode or system-mode issue. The user tried running SCREEN 12 (VGA) and SCREEN 9 (EGA), but both resulted in an "Illegal Function Call" error.

Hmm, QBASIC is a high-level language interpreter that runs in user mode because it doesn't require kernel privileges. When it tries to access graphics modes like VGA or EGA, it's likely using BIOS interrupts or system calls to set the display mode. If these functions aren't working, the issue might be deeper than just the application itself.

Since the problem occurs with other programs too that default to EGA crashing, it suggests a common underlying cause. This points towards something related to hardware emulation because if multiple applications are failing similarly, it's probably not a bug in QBASIC alone but how the system is handling graphics modes.

In QEMU, emulating video modes correctly requires proper setup of video bios and device drivers. If EGA/VGA modes aren't being initialized properly by QEMU, that would cause these errors. So this isn't an issue with QBASIC (user-mode) but rather how QEMU is managing the system's hardware or BIOS settings.

Therefore, this bug is more about how the system handles graphics initialization, which falls under system-mode issues because it involves lower-level operations and device handling.
