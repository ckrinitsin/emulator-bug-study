Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU into either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let's start by understanding the error message.

The error is during the compilation of `qemu-system-x86` on Ubuntu 18.04.1. The log shows a problem in `memfd.c` where there's a static declaration of `memfd_create` after a non-static one. This seems like a conflict between the source code and the system headers.

Looking at the error, it points to `/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/mman-shared.h`, which is part of the system's C library. The system header declares `memfd_create` without static, but the QEMU code tries to declare it as static. This leads to a conflict because the function is already declared in the system headers.

Now, considering whether this is user-mode or system-mode related. User-mode issues typically involve problems running applications under the hood, while system-mode deals with hardware interaction, higher privileges, and device management. QEMU itself runs in user mode when emulating systems, but building it might touch on system libraries and headers.

The error here is about compiling a source file that's part of QEMU's build process. It's not related to running the emulator but rather how it interacts with system headers during compilation. This suggests an issue with compatibility between QEMU's code and the host system's libraries, which might be more on the system side.

So, this bug seems to involve how QEMU's source interacts with system-level includes and declarations. Therefore, it's likely a system-mode related issue.
