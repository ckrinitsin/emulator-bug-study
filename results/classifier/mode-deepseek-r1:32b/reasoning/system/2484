Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this QEMU bug report is about user-mode or system-mode issues. The problem mentioned is related to the `--without-default-devices` configuration causing confusing output in query-gic-capabilities. 

First, I should understand what QEMU's user-mode and system-mode entail. User-mode QEMU typically runs without needing root privileges and emulates a subset of hardware, often used for testing or running binaries from another architecture. It doesn't have the same level of device emulation as system-mode.

On the other hand, System-mode QEMU is used to run full virtual machines, including hardware devices like GPUs, network interfaces, etc., which require higher privileges and more complex configurations. This mode deals with peripherals and operating systems in a more comprehensive way.

The query here mentions `--without-default-devices`, which suggests it's about device configuration. GIC (Generic Interrupt Controller) capabilities are related to how the system handles interrupts, which is a low-level hardware aspect. Since this involves device handling and interrupt management, it seems more aligned with system-mode operations rather than user-mode.

So, putting it all together, the bug report likely pertains to system-mode because it's dealing with device configurations and interrupt controllers, which are higher-privilege aspects.

The issue relates to device configuration and interrupt handling in QEMU. Since this involves hardware emulation and requires higher privileges, it falls under system-mode.
