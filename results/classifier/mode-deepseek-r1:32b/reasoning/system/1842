Alright, let's try to figure out whether this bug is user-mode or system-mode related. The issue is about keyutils not being found by meson during the build of QEMU 8.1.0.

First, I remember that QEMU can run in both user mode and system mode. User-mode emulation is typically for running unprivileged processes without hardware acceleration, while system-mode involves full virtualization, often requiring higher privileges and access to device drivers or hypervisors.

The problem here seems to be about linking keyutils during the build process. Keyutils are usually related to managing cryptographic keys in Linux, which might involve interacting with kernel-level services or security modules. If QEMU is trying to link against keyutils, it's likely that this is part of its system-mode functionality because accessing key management systems often requires deeper integration with the operating system.

Also, looking at the commit mentioned, the removal of KEYUTILS from config-host.h might have inadvertently disabled a feature that's necessary for system-mode operations. Without keyutils support, certain security features or device emulations in QEMU might fail.

Considering that meson is failing to find keyutils, it suggests that the build process expects this library for certain components. Since key management can be critical for secure virtualization, which falls under system-mode responsibilities, I think this bug affects system-mode functionality.

So, putting it all together, the issue seems related to QEMU's system-mode operations because it involves kernel-level interactions and security features that aren't typically part of user-mode emulation.
