Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The issue is about QEMU segfaulting when run on an older macOS version because it uses the strchrnul function, which was introduced in a newer macOS. 

The problem arises during compilation when Meson incorrectly detects that the function exists without including the appropriate header. This leads to using a function not available on older systems.

So, this seems like an issue with how QEMU is built and linked against system libraries. It's about compatibility across different OS versions, specifically in how functions are detected and used during compilation.

Since it's related to compiling code that interacts with the OS's C library and ensuring compatibility across different macOS versions, I think this falls under 'system-mode'. It involves lower-level interactions between the program and the system's libraries, which are part of the operating system itself. The problem is about the environment setup during compilation, affecting how QEMU runs in a system context.
