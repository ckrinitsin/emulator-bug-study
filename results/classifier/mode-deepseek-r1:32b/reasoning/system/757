Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either user-mode or system-mode related. The bug is about "intel-hda: stream reset bits are broken." Intel HDA refers to the High Definition Audio codecs used in many motherboards and sound cards.

Since it's dealing with hardware components (peripherals/devices) and their drivers, which are part of the operating system's kernel, this falls into system-mode. System-mode issues involve higher privileges because they interact directly with hardware and low-level system operations.

So, I'll classify this as 'system'.
