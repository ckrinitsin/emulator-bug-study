Okay, I need to classify this bug report as either 'user' or 'system'. The issue is about exposing the ARCH_CAP_MDS_NO bit (bit 5 of ARCH_CAPABILITIES) to the guest in QEMU. 

ARCH_CAP_MDS_NO relates to CPU capabilities and security features like MDS (Microarchitectural Data Sampling). This affects how the virtual machine handles sensitive data, which is a low-level system function.

Since this involves modifying how the guest OS interacts with hardware capabilities, it's likely related to the hypervisor or device emulation in QEMU. These are system-level components requiring higher privileges and dealing with peripherals/devices.

Therefore, this bug report falls under 'system-mode'.
