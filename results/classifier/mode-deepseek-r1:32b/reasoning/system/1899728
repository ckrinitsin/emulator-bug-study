Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this bug report about QEMU is related to user-mode or system-mode. The user built QEMU 5.1.0 from source on CentOS 8 using specific configure options and then tried to access the man page for qemu-system-x86_64 but got a "No manual entry found" error.

First, I'll look at what the user did. They ran the configure script with --prefix=/usr and specified target-list as x86_64-softmmu and x86_64-linux-user. The targets include both softmmu and linux-user, which suggests they're building for both system emulation and user-mode execution.

When they tried to access the man page for qemu-system-x86_64, it didn't find the entry. This could mean a few things: either the man pages weren't installed correctly, or perhaps the target wasn't built as expected.

Since qemu-system-x86_64 is part of the system emulation (system-mode), and the user tried to access its man page, which isn't found, it's possible that there was an issue during installation. Maybe the installation didn't place the man pages correctly or they were omitted.

But the fact that they built both softmmu and linux-user targets might mean that some components are installed but others aren't. It could also be a permissions issue where the man pages are present but not accessible due to incorrect directory permissions.

So, considering this is about the system-mode component (qemu-system-x86_64) and the inability to access its documentation, it's likely a system-mode related bug.
