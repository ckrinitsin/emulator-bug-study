Okay, I need to figure out whether this bug report about QEMU should be classified as user-mode or system-mode. The issue is "mret trigger exception when pmp equals false." Let's break it down.

First, mret stands for machine return. It's a CPU instruction used in RISC-V architectures to return from an exception handler. PMP refers to Physical Memory Protection, which is a feature that controls access to physical memory regions, often used for security and isolation purposes.

So, when PMP is disabled (equals false), executing mret triggers an exception. That suggests it's related to how the CPU handles exceptions and memory protection, which are low-level system functions. 

In QEMU, this would pertain to the emulator's handling of system instructions and hardware features. Since exceptions and memory management involve higher privileges and operating system interactions, it falls under system-mode.

Therefore, this bug is likely related to system-mode.
