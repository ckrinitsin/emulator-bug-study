Okay, I need to classify this QEMU bug report as either 'user' or 'system'. The error message mentions HPFAR_EL2.NS not set for a non-secure read in S-EL1. Let me break this down.

HPFAR_EL2 is an address register in the EL2 exception level, which is part of the system control and privilege levels. NS stands for Non-Secure, so it's related to handling secure and non-secure states, probably in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) context. S-EL1 refers to Secure EL1, another privileged mode.

Since these are all about Exception Levels and security states, this seems to be dealing with low-level system configuration and privilege modes. That usually falls under system-mode operations because it involves higher privileges and interactions with the operating system or hardware.

So, I think this bug is related to system-mode.
