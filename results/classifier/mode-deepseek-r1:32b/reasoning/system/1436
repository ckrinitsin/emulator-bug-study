Okay, I'm trying to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. Let's break down the information provided.

The problem occurs in omap-dss, which is part of QEMU's hardware emulation. The error happens during a memory allocation when handling a large buffer. From the code snippets, it looks like the function `omap_rfbi_write` sets a pixel count, then later `omap_rfbi_transfer_start` doubles that value to allocate a buffer using `g_realloc()`. The issue arises because the allocated size becomes too large, causing an out-of-memory error.

The steps to reproduce involve writing specific values to memory addresses in QEMU's system emulation mode. The commands use `-machine n810`, which is a system-on-chip machine type, and `-display none` suggests it's running without graphical output but still emulating hardware devices like the RFBI (a display controller).

The error message shows that AddressSanitizer detected an allocation size exceeding the allowed maximum. This points to a problem in how memory is being handled within QEMU's device emulation code.

Since the issue relates to hardware device handling and memory management in system emulation, it falls under 'system-mode' because it involves emulating low-level peripherals and their interactions with the virtual machine.
