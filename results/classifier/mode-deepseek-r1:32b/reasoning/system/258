Okay, I need to classify this bug report about adding an Illumnos VM image in QEMU as either user-mode or system-mode related. Let me think through the details.

Illumnos is a Unix-like operating system based on OpenIndiana. When creating a VM image for it using QEMU, the process typically involves setting up hardware virtualization features like emulating CPUs, disks, network interfaces, and other peripherals. This kind of setup usually requires lower-level operations since it's dealing with virtualized hardware components.

System-mode issues in QEMU are related to higher privileges because they involve handling device emulation, which interacts with the host system's resources. Since adding a VM image would require configuring these devices and ensuring proper resource allocation, it falls under system-mode.

Additionally, managing virtual machines often requires administrative privileges to access certain resources and settings on the host system. This further points towards it being a system-mode issue rather than something that happens in user space where applications run with standard user permissions.

So, putting it all together, adding an Illumnos VM image in QEMU involves system-level operations, making it a 'system' related bug report.
