Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this bug is user-mode or system-mode related. Let's see what the problem is.

The user is running a Go application inside a Docker container using QEMU for armv7l architecture. The issue occurs when they disable core 0 by setting --cpuset-cpus=1-55 in Docker. The error logs show a fatal error with an illegal instruction (SIGILL) and a segmentation fault, which suggests something is wrong at a low level.

Go's environment shows that CGO is enabled, which means it's compiling C code as part of the Go binary. Since QEMU is involved for ARM emulation on what might be an x86 host, there could be issues with how system calls or instructions are handled when core 0 is excluded. Core 0 in a multi-core setup often handles interrupts and certain critical tasks. Disabling it might affect how the kernel schedules processes or handles exceptions.

The error messages point to problems in the scheduler (schedule: holding locks) and an illegal instruction, which could be due to QEMU not correctly emulating ARM instructions when running on non-core 0. This sounds like a system-level issue because it involves CPU cores, process scheduling, and possibly how Docker interacts with the kernel.

Also, since this happens only when core 0 is disabled, it's likely related to how the OS or Docker handles process isolation and resource allocation across multiple CPUs. That makes me think it's a system-mode problem.
