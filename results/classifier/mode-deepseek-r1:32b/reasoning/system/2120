Okay, I need to classify this bug report about a typo in "isar_feature_aa64_tidcp1" for the arm64 architecture in QEMU. Let me think through what each part means.

First, "isar_feature_aa64_tidcp1" sounds like it's related to ARM instructions or features. ARM has different modes and features that affect how the processor operates. The term "aa64" refers to AArch64, which is the 64-bit execution state of ARM processors. 

The function or feature mentioned here likely relates to system-level operations because it's about CPU features rather than user applications. QEMU handles both user-mode and system-mode emulation. User-mode deals with running applications, while system-mode involves emulating the entire OS environment, including devices and peripherals.

Since this is about a specific ARM64 instruction set feature, it's probably affecting how QEMU emulates the processor at a lower level, which would be part of the system-mode emulation. Therefore, I think this bug report falls under 'system'.
