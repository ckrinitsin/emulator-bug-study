Okay, so I need to classify this bug report as either 'user-mode' or 'system-mode'. The user is reporting issues when running their OS in Rust using QEMU. They're getting a lot of warnings about TCG not supporting various features like FMA, X2APIC, AVX, etc. They also mention that they need APIC support for their kernel and are using specific CPU flags in QEMU.

Hmm, let's break this down. User-mode issues usually relate to applications running on top of an OS, while system-mode deals with lower-level stuff like hardware interaction, device drivers, or the hypervisor layer. In this case, the problem is happening during boot when the kernel is being loaded into QEMU. The warnings are about CPU features not being supported by TCG, which is QEMU's software accelerator.

Since they're dealing with OS development and specific CPU instructions that interact at a lower level (like APIC, which is part of the system architecture), this seems to be related to how the system is running in a virtualized environment. The fact that they're using '-cpu' flags and specifying features like '+x2apic' suggests it's about system-level configuration.

They also mention needing RDRAND and issues with HAXM not supporting it automatically, which again points towards hardware virtualization and system setup rather than user applications. So, I think this falls under 'system-mode'.
