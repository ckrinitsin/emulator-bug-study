Alright, let's try to figure out whether this bug report is about user-mode or system-mode in QEMU.

So, the problem described involves MMU descriptors, TLBI instructions, and manipulating TTBR0_EL1. I know that the MMU (Memory Management Unit) deals with translating virtual addresses to physical addresses, which is a low-level operation managed by the CPU. 

The code snippets show assembly instructions like TLBI VAE1 and accessing TTBR0_EL1. From what I remember, EL1 refers to Exception Level 1 in ARM architecture, which is typically the operating system's execution level. So this is definitely dealing with higher privileges because user-mode applications don't have access to these registers.

The user mentions that they had to change the TTBR0_EL1 as a workaround in QEMU 2.12 and now it's not working in QEMU 3.1. Since TTBR0_EL1 is part of the system registers, this points towards a system-level issue rather than something related to user applications.

Also, MMU operations like invalidating caches or modifying page tables are usually done by the OS kernel, which runs in system mode. The fact that changing TTBR0_EL1 worked as a workaround suggests it's a problem with how QEMU handles these low-level operations, possibly affecting the state of the MMU that the guest OS relies on.

In summary, since this involves system registers and MMU handling at EL1, it's a system-mode issue.
