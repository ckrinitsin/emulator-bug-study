Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this QEMU issue is user-mode or system-mode related. Let me read through the problem again.

David is having trouble starting a *.abs firmware file using QEMU on Windows 64-bit. He provided details about extracting files from the firmware using binwalk and some other tools. The extracted files include things like bootloader, maincode, and others. When he tried running them with QEMU, it didn't work.

He mentions that readelf says these files aren't ELF files, which suggests they're not in a standard executable format for MIPS. He tried various QEMU commands, including different machine types, CPUs, drive options, but nothing worked. The error about the missing MIPS bios is also noted.

Now, considering whether this is user-mode or system-mode. User-mode issues usually involve applications running on top of an OS, while system-mode deals with lower-level stuff like hardware emulation, BIOS, and device drivers.

In this case, David is trying to boot firmware that's likely for a set-top box receiver. The *.abs file seems to be a firmware image that includes the bootloader and other low-level components. QEMU is being used in a way that requires emulating the entire system, including hardware devices and possibly loading a custom BIOS.

Since he's dealing with firmware at such a low level and trying to get it to boot using QEMU, this seems like a system-mode issue. He needs QEMU to correctly emulate the necessary hardware and load the firmware as if it were running on actual hardware. This involves setting up the correct machine type, CPU, and potentially providing or creating a proper BIOS image if one is required.

The fact that he's using commands related to drives, machines, and trying different configurations points towards system-level setup rather than user applications. So I think this falls under system-mode.
