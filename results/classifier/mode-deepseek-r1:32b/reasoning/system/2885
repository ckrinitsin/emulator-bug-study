Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either 'user' or 'system'. The issue is that the user can't increase the CPU's for an existing RISC-V VM.

First, understanding what QEMU does: it's a machine emulator and virtualizer. It can run different types of virtual machines (VMs) which emulate various hardware architectures like x86, ARM, RISC-V, etc. 

The problem here is specifically with the RISCV VM, trying to increase its CPU cores. Modifying the number of CPUs in a VM typically involves changing configurations that affect how the VM runs at a low level. This kind of change isn't something you'd do from within the user space application; it's more about how the virtualized environment is set up.

In QEMU, when you create or modify a VM, especially concerning hardware resources like CPUs, this is handled by the hypervisor or the system-level configuration. Increasing CPUs might involve reconfiguring the virtual machine at the host level or through management tools that have higher privileges.

Considering whether this relates to user-mode or system-mode: User-mode processes run with lower privileges and don't have direct access to hardware. System-mode, on the other hand, deals with kernel-level operations, device drivers, and managing resources like CPUs, which are critical for VMs.

Since modifying CPU cores in a VM likely requires changes at the hypervisor level or involves system calls that require higher privileges, this bug report is more about how QEMU handles system-level configurations rather than user applications.

Also, peripherals and devices are mentioned in the classification criteria. While not directly about adding hardware, adjusting CPU cores could be seen as modifying virtualized resources which fall under device management.

Therefore, this issue falls into 'system-mode' because it's about managing VM resources at a higher privilege level, involving system-level operations rather than user applications.
