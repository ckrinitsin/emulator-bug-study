Okay, I need to classify this bug report about QEMU as either user-mode or system-mode related. The user provided a brief description mentioning FIS extraction but it's unclear if that's part of the issue.

QEMU is an emulator used for running different operating systems. If the problem involves peripherals, devices, or higher privileges, it might be system-mode because those areas typically require more privilege and involve hardware emulation.

Since the report mentions QEMU, which handles virtualization at a lower level, I'm leaning towards system-mode.
