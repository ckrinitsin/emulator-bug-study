Alright, let's try to figure this out. The user is having an issue when running Blender inside a Docker container on their M1 Mac. They get an error related to /proc/cpuinfo not containing the 'cpu MHz' line. 

I know that Docker on M1 uses qemu for emulation because the host is ARM and the container is x86_64. Qemu can sometimes have issues with how it presents certain system information inside the VM.

The error message mentions ArchError in a Blender file, pointing to /proc/cpuinfo. So, Blender relies on this file to get CPU info, but it's not present as expected.

Looking into why /proc/cpuinfo might be missing 'cpu MHz', I recall that on some systems, especially emulated ones, this line isn't always there. M1 Macs using qemu might not expose this information correctly to the container.

So, is this a user-mode or system-mode issue? User-mode deals with applications running in userspace, while system-mode involves lower-level stuff like device drivers and hardware access.

Since /proc/cpuinfo is part of the kernel's proc filesystem, which provides system info, it seems more related to how the system presents itself. The qemu layer might not be correctly exposing the CPU MHz info to the container, affecting system-level files.

Thus, this issue likely falls under system-mode because it involves the interaction between the emulation layer and the kernel-provided information.
