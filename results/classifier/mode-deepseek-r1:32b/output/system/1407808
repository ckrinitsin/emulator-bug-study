virtual console gives strange response to ANSI DSR

With "-serial vc" (which is the default), qemu make strange responses to the ANSI DSR escape sequence (\033[6n) which can confuse guests.

Terminal emulators supporting the ANSI escape sequences usually support the "Device Status Report" escape sequence, \033[6n, to which as a response the terminal injects as input the response \033[n;mR, containing the current cursor position. An application running in the guest can use this escape sequence to, for example, figure out the size of the terminal it is running under, which can be useful as the guest has no other standard way to figure out a "size" for the serial port.

Unfortunately, it seems that qemu when run with "-serial vc" (which appears to be the default), when qemu gets the \033[6n escape sequence on the serial port, it just responds with a single \033, and that's it! This can confuse an application, could concievably assume that a terminal either supports this escape sequence and injects the correct response (\033[n;mR), or doesn't support it and injects absolutely nothing as input - but not something in between.

This caused a problem on one shell implementation on OSv that tried to figure out the terminal's size, and had to work around this unexpected behavior (see https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/commit/b79223584be40459861d1c12e1cb67e3e49e2a12).
