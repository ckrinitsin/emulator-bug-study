qemu build failure, hxtool is a bash script, not a /bin/sh script

hxtool (part of the early build process) is a bash script.  Running it with /bin/sh yields a syntax error on line 10:

 10             STEXI*|ETEXI*|SQMP*|EQMP*) flag=$(($flag^1))

$(( expr )) is a bash extension, not part of /bin/sh.

Note that replacing the sh in the first line in hxtool with /bin/bash does not help, because the script is run manually from the Makefile with sh:

154         $(call quiet-command,sh $(SRC_PATH)/scripts/hxtool -h < $< > $@,"  GEN   $@")

The fix is to change those lines to

154         $(call quiet-command,bash $(SRC_PATH)/scripts/hxtool -h < $< > $@,"  GEN   $@")

(there are five or so).
