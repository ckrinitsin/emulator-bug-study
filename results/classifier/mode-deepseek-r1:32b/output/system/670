qemu x86_64 for microsoft windows hangs when booting a Debian Live 11.1 iso file
Description of problem:
qemu displays the boot screen from the live linux iso and starts the boot, but no more display is performed even when waiting for approximately 30 minutes
Steps to reproduce:
1. Get hold of a Live Linux iso from Debian 11.1
2. Set up the Microsoft Windows version of qemu from https://qemu.weilnetz.de/
3. Attempt to boot the Live Linux iso
Additional information:
I also tested older versions of QEMU from the Weilnetz web site. 6.0.0 and 5.2.0 are bad; 5.1.0 and older are good. I then tested the same command line ( no acceleration ) under Linux Tumbleweed 20211014 with qemu 6.1.0 and the iso booted successfully. I have not tried with isos from distributions other than Debian 11.1 . So there is a bug with the Microsoft Windows-specific code in qemu.
If you need the specific Live Linux that I was using, let me know and I will get it to you somehow. It is several GB in size so I cannot upload it anywhere conveniently.
