WHPX won't enable x86_64v3 level instructions
Description of problem:
x86_64v3 support is not available inside guest
Steps to reproduce:
1. Boot the image
2. Open terminal
3. Run `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help` and check which levels are available in the output
4. Or run `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --list-diagnostics | grep isa` and check `isa_1` value (expected 7 for v3 (3 bits being set))
Additional information:
Due to this some Linux distribution, like Centos Stream 10, will not be able to boot with WHPX acceleration enabled.
