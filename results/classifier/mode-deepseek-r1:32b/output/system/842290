MIPS Malta mini-bootloader print function has bad jump instruction

One of the hardcoded bootloader library instructions in the MIPS Malta mini-bootloader's print function is:

stl_raw(p++, 0x08000205);                                     /* j 814 */

Since this function is loaded at 0xbfc00808, this jump jumps to the middle of nowhere. The properly-encoded instruction is:

stl_raw(p++, 0x0bf00205);                                     /* j 814 */

With this patch, the print function behaves as expected.
