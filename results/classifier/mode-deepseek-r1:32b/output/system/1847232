qemu TCG in s390x mode issue with calculating HASH

When using go on s390x on Debian x64 (buster) (host) and debian s390x (sid) (guest) I run into the following problem :

The following occurs while trying to build a custom project :

go: <email address hidden>: Get https://proxy.golang.org/github.com/%21factom%21project/basen/@v/v0.0.0-20150613233007-fe3947df716e.mod: local error: tls: bad record MAC

Doing a git bisect I find that this problem only occurs on and after commit 08ef92d556c584c7faf594ff3af46df456276e1b

Before that commit, all works fine. Past this commit, build always fails.

Without any proof, It looks like a hash calculation bug related to using z/Arch vector facilities...
