issue while installing docker inside s390x container

This is in reference to https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static/issues/108.
I am facing issue while installing docker inside s390x container under qemu on Ubuntu 18.04 host running on amd64.
Following are the contents of /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/qemu-s390x on Intel host after running 
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
enabled
interpreter /usr/bin/qemu-s390x-static
flags: F
offset 0
magic 7f454c4602020100000000000000000000020016
mask ffffffffffffff00fffffffffffffffffffeffff
I could get docker service up with the following trick. 
printf '{"iptables": false,"ip-masq": false,"bridge": "none" }' > /etc/docker/daemon.json
But even though docker service comes up, images are not getting pulled, docker pull fails with the following error.
failed to register layer: Error processing tar file(exit status 1):
