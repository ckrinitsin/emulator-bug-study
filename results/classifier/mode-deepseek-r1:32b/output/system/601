Steps to reproduce:
See https://gitlab.com/ryan-feather/docker-tensorflow-qemu-bug/ for Dockerfile and description of steps repeating here.
1. Using the dockerfile 
```
FROM python:3.9-buster
RUN pip install tensorflow==2.6.0

```
2. `docker buildx build --iidfile build.id --platform linux/amd64 . --progress=plain`

Additional information:
See 
https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5342 where the Docker team suggests this is a qemu bug. I couldn't find where anyone had opened one of these here, so hopefully this isn't a duplicate.
