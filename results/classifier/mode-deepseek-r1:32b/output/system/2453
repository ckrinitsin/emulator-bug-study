qemu-system-rx aborts when trying to run the u-boot binary
Description of problem:
I tried to run the tests/avocado/machine_rx_gdbsim.py:RxGdbSimMachine.test_uboot test (which is not run by default since it is marked as flaky), but seems like QEMU now always aborts when trying to run with the u-boot bios.
Steps to reproduce:
1. wget https://acc.dl.osdn.jp/users/23/23888/u-boot.bin.gz
2. gunzip u-boot.bin.gz
3. qemu-system-rx -nographic -M gdbsim-r5f562n8 -bios u-boot.bin
Additional information:
Aborts with: ``qemu-system-rx: ../../devel/qemu/accel/tcg/translator.c:286: translator_ld: Assertion `((base ^ pc) & TARGET_PAGE_MASK) == 0' failed.``
