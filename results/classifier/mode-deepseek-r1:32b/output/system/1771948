aarch64 msr CNTFRQ_EL0

Hello,

I'm running qemu 2.12 on a raspberry pi 3 with the command:

qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3 -serial stdio -kernel executable.bin

On my start file (right in the beginning with the highest EL), the following instructions:

ldr x0 , =19200000
msr CNTFRQ_EL0, x0


and qemu halts on the "msr CNTFRQ_EL0, x0" instruction.

I believe this is not a normal behavior.

Thank you
