qemu displays message "Setup failed, please check external storage is available and has enough room."

I tried to launch the Android app PokerStarsFR, and after it began initialization, the launch failed with the above error. I'm running qemu on a Dell XPS 13 (9370) laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The standard apps launch OK, but this one does not. I had downloaded it from the PokerStars site https://www.pokerstars.fr/en/poker/download/android/.

I am running qemu version 2.5.0
