Possibly inaccurate statement in PC Platform Docs

The documentation at:

http://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Platforms/PC

Contains the statement that the processor, after reset, executes code starting from address 0xFFFFF, corresponding to the last byte of the single megabyte of memory in the old 8086 address range.

From my recollection of working in the microcomputer industry in the late 1980's, execution actually starts in real mode at the start of the last 16 bytes of addressable memory, at 0xFFFF0.  Think about it - if it's the last byte there's no room for an address operand to accompany a 1-byte opcode.
