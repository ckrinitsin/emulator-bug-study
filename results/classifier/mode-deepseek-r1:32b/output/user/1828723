[RFE] option to suppress gemu_log() output

With user mode emulation, messages from genu_log() are emitted unconditionally to stderr. I didn't find a way to suppress them. It would be nice to have options similar to the -D/-d options to be able to filter and/or redirect the output.

My use case is chroot/container execution for different architectures via binfmt. In this case it will appear as if the binary in question had emitted messages like "Unsupported setsockopt ..." to stderr while in fact the message came from qemu-*-static.
