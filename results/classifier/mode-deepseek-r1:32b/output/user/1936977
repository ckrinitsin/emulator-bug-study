 qemu-arm-static crashes "segmentation fault" when running "git clone" 

This is a reopen of #1869073 for `qemu-user-static/focal-updates,focal-security,now 1:4.2-3ubuntu6.17 amd64`. 

`git clone` reproducably segfaults in `qemu-arm-static` chroot.

#1869073 mentions this should have been fixed for newer versions of QEMU, but for `focal` there's no newer version available, even in `focal-backports`.
