Can't build static on ARM (Raspbian)

I am trying to build static QEMU on Raspbian, chrooted into using systemd-nspawn with QEMU 4.0.0.
This is how my compiling looks:

Just the problematic part:

How I do the compiling:

It is a coincidence, or the build fails because it cannot find lp11-kit. I did some symlinks:
ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libp11-kit.so.0 /usr/lib/libp11-kit.so.0
ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libp11-kit.so /usr/lib/libp11-kit.so
(should I also symlink libp11.so and libp11.so.2? I think I have installed all required p11 packages!
