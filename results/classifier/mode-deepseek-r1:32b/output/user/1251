Octeon Instruction BBIT Bug
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile 64bit binary for Octeon with Octeon instructions    
`mips64-octeon-linux-gnu-gcc -o hello hello.c`
2. Run with `qemu-mips64`    
`qemu-mips64 -cpu Octeon68XX hello`
3. Get the output below:
```
qemu: uncaught target signal 4 (Illegal instruction) - core dumped
Illegal instruction
```
Additional information:
I have a patch for this that I will be submitting to trivial-patches. This is not enough to emulate Octeon specific binaries alone. For small binaries mapping the `CVMSEG_LM = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF8000 - 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF9FFF` to empty RAM and using this patch is enough. There are additional support issues for `N32` binaries that will require a separate issue.
