linux-user emulation of setsockopt ignores optlen

setsockopt always treats the argument as a 4-byte int. This breaks timeout options (for which it's an 8- or 16-byte timeval structure, depending on word size) and possibly other socket options. int is probably a safe default, but options whose values are other types need special-case conversion code.
