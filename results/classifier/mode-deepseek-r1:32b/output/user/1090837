Error in building Qemu-1.3.0 on Solaris 10 

While trying to build Qemu on Oracle Solaris 10 (SPARC processor), I encountered the following error in the configure step:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ --install=/usr/ucb/install
./configure: bad substitution
./configure: !: not found
./configure: !: not found
./configure: !: not found
./configure: !: not found
./configure: !: not found
./configure: curl-config: not found
./configure: curl-config: not found

As the following bug report says: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/636315, "sh" is hard-coded in the script. Can't the script be modified to accept a $SHELL argument to make use of bash or other shell during configure and make step?
