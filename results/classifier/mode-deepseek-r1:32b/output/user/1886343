configure has non-posix bash syntax

which gives an error when run on a system that uses dash for /bin/sh.

The problem is at line 6464 which has
    if test "$have_keyring" == "yes"
the double equal sign is non-posix bash syntax that isn't accepted by posix shells like dash.  This was added 2020-05-25 according to git blame so looks like a recent problem.

On an Ubuntu 20.04 system with top of tree sources I get
gondor:2027$ ../qemu/configure --prefix=/home/wilson/FOSS/qemu/install-qemu-tmp --target-list=riscv64-linux-user,riscv64-softmmu,riscv32-linux-user,riscv32-softmmu
../qemu/configure: 6464: test: yes: unexpected operator
...

configure completes OK, so this is a minor problem.  It is just one configure test that is failing to work properly.
