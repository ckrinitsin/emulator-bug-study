qemu-system-x86_64 --help (or --version) gives no output

I have Arch Linux with qemu 5.0.0-6 (seen with pacman). Running VMs work just fine, but when I run qemu-system-x86_64 --version or qemu-system-x86_64 --help, there is no feedback on the screen. This behavior messes up other applications (GNS3 in my case that cannot recognize qemu as correctly installed because there is no feedback.
My kernel is 5.6.11.
