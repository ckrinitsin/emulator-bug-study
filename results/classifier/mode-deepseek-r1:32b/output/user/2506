LC_RPATH stripped despite setting INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH=FALSE
Description of problem:
When I try to run qemu, I get the following output:
> dyld[93165]: Library not loaded: @rpath/libjpeg.62.dylib
>   Referenced from: <85BC1FBA-CA2E-3CAC-9ABF-E5330AC86CAF> /Users/mj/local/bin/qemu-system-aarch64
>   Reason: no LC_RPATH's found
Steps to reproduce:
If the qemu-9.0.2 folder is present, remove it:
```
$ rm -rf qemu-9.0.2
```
Create the source folder:
```
$ tar xzf qemu-9.0.2.tar.xz
$ cd qemu-9.0.2
```

Make sure the following environment variables are set:
```
$ export CC=clang
$ export LDFLAGS="-rpath $HOME/local/lib"
$ export INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH=FALSE
```

Configure as follows:
```
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local --disable-sdl --enable-slirp --enable-fdt=internal --enable-spice
```

Build
```
$ make -j 10
```

Note there are a large number of linker warnings like this:
> ld: warning: duplicate -rpath '/Users/mj/local/lib' ignored

Execute this:
```
$ otool -l build/qemu-system-aarch64 | grep LC_RPATH -A2
```

See this output
>          cmd LC_RPATH
>      cmdsize 32
>         path /Users/mj/local/lib (offset 12) 

Change directory to $HOME/local/bin & execute:
```
$ otool -l qemu-system-aarch64 | grep LC_RPATH -A2
```

The output is now empty - the LC_RPATH has been stripped by the install.  This results in the failure to execute the resulting binary.  Note, I tried using install_name_tool to add the RPATH, but it warned me this changed the signature of the file, and it would not run.

Executing qemu-system-aarch64 produces the following:
>  dyld[93165]: Library not loaded: @rpath/libjpeg.62.dylib
>    Referenced from: <85BC1FBA-CA2E-3CAC-9ABF-E5330AC86CAF> /Users/mj/local/bin/qemu-system-aarch64
>    Reason: no LC_RPATH's found
