Problems related to checking page crossing in use_goto_tb()

The discussion that led to this bug discovery can be found in this 
mailing list thread:

A workaround for this problem would be to check for page crossings for 
both the user and system modes in the use_goto_tb() function across 
targets. Some targets like "hppa" already implement this fix but others
don't.

To solve the root cause of this problem, the linux-user/mmap.c should 
be fixed to do all the invalidations required. By doing so, up to 6.93% 
performance improvements will be achieved.
