The guest is only starting after its SDL window gets focus

I’m using i3wm and have workspace assigning rules that make QEMU’s SDL window be assigned to a workspace I don’t really switch to.

When I run start a guest machine, its SDL window is moved to that workspace (I never see it); but the machine freezes after displaying that black window. It only starts booting after I switch to the workspace and view the window.
