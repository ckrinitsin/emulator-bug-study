QEMU doesn't use multi-threaded TCG on aarch64 host with x86-64 guest
Description of problem:
Even configured to emulate more than one vCPU, at the host it only uses 1 CPU at 100%. The same test was made using same architecture (aarch64 on aarch64), and it archieves to use all phisical cores. The first VM uses TGC, the second one uses KVM. Screenshots attached.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use official Debian distro from Rock Pi 5B
2. Install XFCE4 and VirtManager, qemu aarch64 and qemu x86_64
3. Download debian x64 netinstall iso
4. Install system with basic features, then install stress-ng
5. Stop, configure -smp to 1 socket, 4 cores, 2 threads, it will result on 8 vCPUs
6. Login as root and run stress-ng to 8 CPU
7. Ctrl+Right to another TTY, install and run htop, you will see 8 CPUs on 100% usage
8. At host, open Terminal, install and run htop, you will see just one core at 100%
Additional information:
Both VMs tested. aarch64 as KVM that works fine, x86_64 as TGC that uses only one CPU.
