qemu-img compare -m option is missing

Comparing images using multiple streams (like qemu-img convert) maybe effectively sped up when one of the images (or both) is RBD. qemu-img convert does it's job perfectly while converting. Please implement the same for image comparison. Since operations are read-only, -W is useless, but may be introduced as well for debugging/performance purposes.
