[2.6] user network broken reaching foreign servers on Win64

Both on master and, starting with 2016-03-22 builds from http://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/, user mode network can't reach foreign servers. For example, wget http://mifritscher resolves the DNS, but then the message "network target couldn't be reached" occures. 2016-03-03 works fine. I suspect the IPv6 changes. My connection is IPv4 only.

I tested via knoppix 7.6. The command line is

qemu-system-x86_64.exe -m 512 -k de --cdrom c:\Users\michaelfritscher\Downloads\linux\KNOPPIX_V7.4.2DVD-2014-09-28-DE.iso -netdev user,id=mynet0,restrict=n -device e1000,netdev=mynet0
