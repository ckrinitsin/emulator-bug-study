Compilation on MSYS2/MinGW-w64 fails with error: "No rule to make target capstone.lib"

I submitted this bug to Capstone directly but I figured it'd be useful to post it here too. The IS_MINGW check in the Makefile for Capstone fails under MSYS2 MinGW-w64 because cc --version doesn't have mingw in the output anymore:

$ whereis cc
cc: /mingw64/bin/cc.exe

$ cc --version
cc.exe (Rev2, Built by MSYS2 project) 8.3.0

Really simple patch:
