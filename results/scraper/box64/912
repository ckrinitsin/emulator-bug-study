Error: PageSize configuration is wrong: configured with 4096, but got 16384
Just in case someone else encounters the said error on Apple hardware, either when getting box64 from apt-get or building using some instruction from the internet.

The solution that helped me is to build box64 from sources: https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/docs/COMPILE.md
In my case I used M1 Asahi instruction with these flags:
```-D M1=1 -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo```
