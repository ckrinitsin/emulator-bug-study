Unity games not loading on M1
Seems that for some reason, no Unity games get past splash screen on my M1 machine. Something I noticed they have in common is a framebuffer request with 0hz, and the following error:
`Error: Global Symbol _ULx86_64_local_addr_space not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT @0x7fff02036410 ((nil)) in UnityPlayer.so`

Some games get stuck at the splash screen, some don't have a splash screen and get stuck with a one-color framebuffer. Some throw a not-responding dialogue.
