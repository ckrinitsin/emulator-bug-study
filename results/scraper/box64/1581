Wine's Wayland driver does not load
I'm trying to run wine (wine-9.9) on aarch64, in a Ubuntu 24.04 userspace within Docker since the main OS uses muslibc. Wine was compiled manually on a Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 machine with Wayland and syswow64 support:
```
./configure --enable-archs=i386,x86_64 --enable-win64 --with-wayland=yes
```
I enable Wayland like this:
```
wine reg.exe add HKCU\\Software\\Wine\\Drivers /v Graphics /d wayland,x11
```
I can start `winecfg`, it works by falling back to X11, but when force it to use Wayland by having an empty `DISPLAY` environment variable it fails to start.

I created a log with `WAYLAND_DEBUG=1 WINEDEBUG=+loaddll,+module,+imports,+waylanddrv,+x11drv` and attached the part of it where `winewayland.drv` is being loaded. Unfortunately I don't have an understanding of what is happening here under the hood. Should I not see a line like this somewhere?
```
Using native(wrapped) libwayland-client.so.0
```

Some notes:
- aarch64 Wayland apps work within the Docker container (tested: `foot`, [hello-wayland](https://github.com/emersion/hello-wayland))
- the same "hello-wayland", but compiled on x86_64 and run through `box64`, crashes with a `SIGBUS` exception (another bug?)
- in `gdb` I can do `file box64` and `run wine winecfg` but I have no idea what to do here lol
- the wine Wayland driver _does_ work on the x86_64 system where I built wine

Attaching more uncut gzipped logs because it's free, but they are large:
