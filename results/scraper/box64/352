Error: PltResolver: Symbol _obstack_begin(ver 3: _obstack_begin@GLIBC_2.2.5) not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT
I'm a beginner and trying to use box64 to run SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark. 
I uploaded a sub test set(SPECCPU2006/benchspec/CPU2006/403.gcc/run/run_base_ref_gcc43-64bit.0000) to ARMv8-AArch64 machine, and used box64 to run it, but this error occured:

> box64 ../gcc_base.gcc43-64bit 166.in -o 166.s
...
Error: PltResolver: Symbol _obstack_begin(ver 3: _obstack_begin@GLIBC_2.2.5) not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT 0x93d0b8 (0x401606) in run_base_ref_gcc43-64bit.0000/gcc_base.gcc43-64bit

_obstack_begin seems to be a function in the obstack library, is this error caused by not wrapping the obstack library in box64? the version of box64 is 0.1.6
