settings from command line (environment variables) should not be overwritten by configuration file
Hi,

while working on #644 I noticed that settings from rc-files overwrite settings given via environment variables. This is unorthodox and makes it harder to use box64. I know no application where configuration file settings overwrite settings given on the command line. The reason that it's usually the other way round is, that configuration files are intended to specify a default for most executions of a program which can then be altered on a case-by-case basis by command line options (or environment variables in case of box64). As it is, if a user wants to change a setting for an individual execution of box64, they have to first change the value in the configuration file, then run box64 and then change the value back to its original value. This could be avoided if box64 would prioritize environment variable settings over configuration file settings.

Is there a strong reason to do it the other way round for box64?

(also, where its says `~/.bashrc` in `docs/README.md`, it should probably say `~/.box64rc`, no?)

(also, instead of a dotfile in the user's HOME, could box64 not instead read a configuration file in an XDG config location like `~/.config/box64/box64rc`?)
