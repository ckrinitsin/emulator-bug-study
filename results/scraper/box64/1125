fzf failing when box64 is installed
Hi. I'm using Asahi Linux. When box64 is installed, invoking fzf throws the following.
```
Dynarec for ARM64, with extension: ASIMD AES CRC32 PMULL ATOMICS PageSize:16384 Running on Icestorm-M1 Firestorm-M1 with 8 Cores
Params database has 25 entries
Box64 with Dynarec v0.2.4 nogit built on Aug 23 2023 00:00:00
Error: PageSize configuration is wrong: configured with 4096, but got 16384
```
While it works normally without it installed.
