Feature request: Support for binfmt-misc F flag
We now have [instructions](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/docs/COMPILE.md#build-a-statically-linked-box64) for building a "highly experimental" static binary for use in a chroot, similar to what qemu can provide.

In the case of deploying chroots using debootstrap, Debian provides a tool called [qemu-debootstrap](https://salsa.debian.org/qemu-team/qemu/-/blob/debian-bookworm/debian/qemu-debootstrap) to automatically perform the multi-step process of building these for foreign architectures. I believe this would previously embed the static qemu binary into the chroot half way through the build process. The tool is currently deprecated because qemu now supports the [binfmt F flag](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.html) and deploys the binfmt config using this by default, so a qemu binary in the chroot is no longer required.

It would be nice if box64 could also work this way, so it could function like a drop-in replacement, and require fewer steps for these kinds of tasks.
