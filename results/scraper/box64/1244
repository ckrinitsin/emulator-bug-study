About Final Fantasy VII Remake
This game is running well on box64. 
With dynamic resolution turned off on ORIN NX, the 720p resolution can reach 25 to 40 frames, while on AYN ODIN2 archlinux, it can reach 15/30 frames(Turnip driver A7xx is still very poor, and the frame rate will be higher in the future).on Nintendo Switch,it can reach 10/18 frames.

 However, there is no sound on any of my devices and I am unable to exit normally.

 Is there a solution currently availableï¼Ÿ

Thank you
