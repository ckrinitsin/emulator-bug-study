Open Zoom on box64 from zoom link.
I am using a Mediatek MT8183, with Debian 11, and KDE desktop, with a Custom kernel, version 5.19.1-stb-mt8+, when I try to open Zoom in box64 from zoom link, zoom tries to open but gives me this error: Unable to create io-slave. klauncher said: Unknown protocol 'zoommtg'.
