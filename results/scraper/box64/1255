Help me with raspberry pi 3 and bricksync
Hi, I'm looking for use the bricksync program, where he is compile from C language in 64 bits.
He is in open source in http://www.bricksync.net/ and a git repo is available in https://github.com/ZZJHONS/Bricksync

1. I have try to compile un 32 bits direct via the raspberry pi but so issues with the arm... and I think with the gcc version.
    Try to compile with my laptop and a VM with raspOS installed ==> not work
    Try to compile with my laptop and a VM with Ubuntu 32bits installed ==> not work again....

2. Try to use the box64 emulator (other way to use the program finally !) and I have this error:
`yaya@raspberrypi:~/bricksync-linux64 $ box86 sh /home/pi/bricksync-linux64/bricksync 
Box86 with Dynarec v0.3.5 eaeacc67 built on Feb  2 2024 19:05:16
Error: reading elf header of /usr/bin/dash, trying to launch natively instead
/home/pi/bricksync-linux64/bricksync: 1: Syntax error: ")" unexpected
`
Is it a syntaxe error when I try to use box64 or the programm doesn't work ?
Can someone explain me the issue ?
