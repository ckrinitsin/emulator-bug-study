Symbil vswscanf not found when running Dota
I have tried with multiple revisions and still with Dota Underlords and Dota 2 ( also CSGO due to same engine)
the issue of vswscanf not found presists. Games will not launch due to this??

Here are a couple logs:
[Dota2-Steam.log](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/7935514/Dota2-Steam.log)
[Dota-Underlords.log](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/7935515/Dota-Underlords.log)

Let me know if you need anymore info. More tests to come.
