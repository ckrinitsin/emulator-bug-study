Box64 doesn't install all libraries in /lib64/ on Asahi Linux
Hi,

I installed box64 (I tried both dnf and compiling) on my M1 Macbook and there are several x86 binaries that I'm unable to launch via box64.

The typical error is :

qemu-x86_64-static: Could not open '/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2': No such file or directory

I've read that ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 should be already installed according to https://box86.org/ .
I also didn't figured out how to install it by myself bc I'm new to Fedora.
I've tried installing the rpm files by hand (didn't worked) and also manually putting the library in /lib64/ (didn't worked either, telling me about some ELF errors while running a program which necessitate this lib)

You can reproduce the issue with the https://slippi.gg/ appimage for example

PS : some apps work great like FreeCAD for ex

Thx for your help and this amazing project !
