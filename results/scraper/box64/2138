Error building with BOX32 option on Neoverse-N1 aarch64/Oracle Cloud (error: ‘FUTEX_LOCK_PI2’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘FUTEX_LOCK_PI’?)
Tried building using various options combinations with cmake .. -D **BOX32=1** and it all returned this specific error no matter what I try.

Sorry if this is a bad report as I'm kinda new to this.
Possibly offtopic: Forced to builld as the GitHub runner is using GLIBC 2.32 while my Ubuntu is using 2.31
/usr/local/bin/box32: /lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /usr/local/bin/box32)
