RAR stdout lost
I built and installed this:
```
$ box64 --version
 PageSize:4096 Running on Cortex-A72 with 4 Cores
Will use time-based emulation for rdtsc, even if hardware counter are available
Will use Software counter measured at 1.0 GHz emulating 2.0 GHz
Params database has 69 entries
Box64 v0.2.8  built on Jun  9 2024 01:29:13
```
but when I run [RAR](https://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarlinux-x64-701.tar.gz) for 64 bit Linux, it runs correctly (I've been able to compress files for example) but the stdout seems to be lost. Instead I get something like this in the output:
```
$ box64 rar
 PageSize:4096 Running on Cortex-A72 with 4 Cores
Will use time-based emulation for rdtsc, even if hardware counter are available
Will use Software counter measured at 1.0 GHz emulating 2.0 GHz

BOX64: Didn't detect 48bits of address space, considering it's 39bits

Looking for rar
Rename process to "rar"
Using emulated /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
Using native(wrapped) libm.so.6
Using emulated /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1
Using native(wrapped) libpthread.so.0
Using native(wrapped) libc.so.6
Using native(wrapped) ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
Using native(wrapped) libdl.so.2
Using native(wrapped) libutil.so.1
Using native(wrapped) librt.so.1
Using native(wrapped) libbsd.so.0
```
and that's all, no stdout from the rar command itself.
