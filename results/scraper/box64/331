Error with openssl1.1.1 on Bedrock server (Error: PltResolver: Symbol TLS_method...)
I am a beginner. I'm translating from Japanese to English, so sorry for any weirdness.

I was trying to set up a Minecraft BedrockServer on ubuntu22.04 LTS/ArmCPU/OracleCloud, but on the way I got an error saying that I need libssl.so.1. [※Image 1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/986243502339944488/986243506425200640/unknown.png)

I think I was able to install it after a kind person showed me a website on how to install it.
Once I restarted my PC, the file path? The error message is as shown in the [※image 2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/976834960382124082/990688939742486548/unknown.png)

How can I solve the error? Thank you in advance for your answer.
