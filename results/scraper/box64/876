[32BITS] I don't think It seems to four IA-32 instructions(daa, das, aaa and aas) for 32bits mode be implemented.
Why you didn't implement 4 BCD x86 instructions(daa[0x27], das[0x2f], aaa[0x37], aas[0x3f])?
I wonder if you planning to implement these IA-32 instructions. Because These opcodes are implemented at box86 and other i386 code emulators and I think It's used to BCD operation in classical PC games or tools.
