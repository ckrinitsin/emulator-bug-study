RE Engine games softlocks and freeze forever
All games on RE engine has 1 problem with box64
After couple of minutes/seconds game's Render just freeze forever, controls doesnt work, but music is still playing
I tested re7, 2, 2 demo, 3, 3 demo, 8, DMCV and all games has this error in logs
01ec:err:sync:RtlLeaveCriticalSection section 00000000116C9748 (null) is not acquired
0204:err:sync:RtlpWaitForCriticalSection section 00000000116C9AC8 (null) wait timed out in thread 0204, blocked by 01ec, retrying (60 sec)

After that game's render just dies
Tried different dxvk, Turnip drivers, dyncfg changes, but still this error appears, so I assume that its box64 glitch
