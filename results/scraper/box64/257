Issue with x64 application launch
I built box64:

[francesco@orangepi4 Projects]$ box64 -v
Dynarec for ARM64, with extension: ASIMD AES CRC32 PMULL PageSize:4096
Box64 with Dynarec v0.1.7 fa07a0f built on Mar 23 2022 18:20:44

on an OrangePi4 (RK3399) running Armbian 22.02.1, without errors.
Now, I'm trying to run an x64 command line utility ("upgrade_tool"):

[francesco@orangepi4 Projects]$ file upgrade_tool
upgrade_tool: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=c045033bffa8866dc148b16718d8a49be47e9ecb, stripped

but unfortunately I get this error message:

[francesco@orangepi4 Projects]$ box64 upgrade_tool

Is there anything I can do to run my utility on the OrangePi?

Thanks,
