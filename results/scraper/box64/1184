BOX64: Missing operand after 'box64'
I am using Termux PRoot Debian.

I wanted to use box64 and wine64, so I installed box64 from the debian sid repo.

`box64_0.2.6+dfsg-2_arm64.deb` is installed.

If you type box64 in the terminal,

The following message is generated.
I haven't tested the wine64 binary yet.

```c
hsm@localhost:~$ box64
BOX64: Missing operand after 'box64'
See 'box64 --help' for more information.
``` 

Will there be any problem with it working?
