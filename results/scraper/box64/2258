Requesting older revision - box64 v0.3.1
I am looking to get a source code copy of version v.0.3.1 / b02942c0 from 12 Nov 2024. I am running this on an RPi5 under Raspberry Pi OS and this version does not break the VARA HF modem program. The current version (v 0.3.3) breaks the modem as it will not perform the registration function when the modem is started up.
