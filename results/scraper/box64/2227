[BOX32] Box32 stopped working on Winlator 
Hi! Thank you very much for your work.

I used modified Winlator with Wine 9.2 bi-arch, tried to run _wfm.exe_ (file manager).
Box32 does not work on Winlator starting from commit https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/3eeb10c0a60ea0106d6201dda80fd771f3d4e17a.
