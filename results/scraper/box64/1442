Lots of unknown symbols with .NET 7 when trying to load the Celeste modloader Everest
Hello, I've been wanting to play some Celeste mods on my android tablet. I've setup the modloader with olympus using my computer first then tar it over to my tablet. Also I'm using the same libs setup mentioned in [here](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/issues/531#issuecomment-1868368021). The output below is 
[Everest.txt](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/14967461/Everest.txt). The latest everest version as of this issue is build 4722. I unfortunately don't have a non android device to reproduce this on.
