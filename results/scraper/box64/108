Beyond: Two Souls Demo (Unimplemented Opcode (C1) 66 0F 3A 40 C1 7F 0F 51 C0 0F 5E C8 0F 29 8B)
`Unimplemented Opcode (C1) 66 0F 3A 40 C1 7F 0F 51 C0 0F 5E C8 0F 29 8B` is what I get when trying to run the Demo of B:TS, downloaded from the Epic Games Store (The game is DRM free there when launched with the `-EpicPortal` argument).
I have not tried the full version yet, simply because I was too lazy to copy it to an external drive (it's like 50GB) but I wouldn't expect any significantly different behavior.
