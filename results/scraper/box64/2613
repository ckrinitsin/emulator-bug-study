Box64 - Unable to Login To Steam (Odin 2)
Hello

After building Box64 with the Box32 options, I was able to get Steam "running" on the Odin 2. Unfortunately, now I've run into an issue where the client will not allow me to sign in. Either it will not recognize that the steam app has authorized a login, or it will show a "busy" icon after pressing "sign in" and will stay that way if attempted manually. For the record, I wasn't able to find options for building for Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, so I attempted it with SD888 in the build options and got this far. After checking vulkaninfo, Vulkan is shown as being version 1.3.285, although I don't know if Vulkan plays any part in this. I recently attempted this again, but with the same results. Again, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Here is the terminal output when trying to install/run using ./steam from the tar.gz package found at
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_under_Linux:
