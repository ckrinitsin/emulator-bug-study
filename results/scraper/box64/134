Box64 breaks GDB break on address
When I set a break to, for example `0x7ffff5c3eda0`, and the program executes on that address, GDB can't stop execution. Instead, box64 prints `<PID>|Warning, ignoring unsupported Int 3 call @0x7ffff5c3eda1`.

I'm running `gdb /path/to/box64 /path/to/target`. Is this not the intended way to debug?
