RPI 5 Raspberian 64bit sateam installed sucessfully. Games not working properly.
Anything that uses vulkan or steam proton does not seem to be working. Terraria boots and runs at 2 fps on minimum settings. hl2 boots and runs at 1 fps minimum settings and its always running OPENGL instead of vulkan. Sven coop says 32 bit loader error but I am 90% sure my box86 works fine or how would i have been able to install steam?.... Ive tried multiple reinstalls and a couple other operating systems. Asked others and they say they have done the same thing as I did and got significantly better results.
