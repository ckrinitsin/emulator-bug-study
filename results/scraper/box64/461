Zoom - reduce  memory overhead?
I now have the Linux-x86_64 Zoom working on a Slarm64 (=Slackware64 Aarch port) on a RazPi 4 w/4G. I had to load a swap file, as the memory exceeded 4G during startup. Sound is yet to test

If it's emulating a library, that uses more ram. How can I find what libraries box64 is emulating? Also, is this line ok?
/path/to/box64 /path/to/ZoomLauncher >~/ZoomLauncher.err 2>&1

I suddenly stopped getting output.
