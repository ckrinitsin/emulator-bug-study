Run SlayTheSpire desktop version on Android 
I'm trying to run SlayTheSpire Linux desktop version on my Android ARM64 phone with a Debian installation.

So far, thanks to the BOX64_BASH feature I was able to install it. However, when I try launching it, I get an error related to Java runtime (the same as reported in #232  and #464 ).

I'm aware that Java support is not ready, so this is just an expression of interest in that feature. Thanks for the great work!
