Raspberry Pi4 4GB no longer booting after install
I have build/installed box64 multiple times according to the instrucions and EVERY time, my Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64 bit) refuses to boot after.

Booting ends in a Black screen via HDMI-Out and Internet wont work for ssh.
 Last thing to appear on Screen seems to be 
<code>[  OK  ] Started Kernel Device Manager</code>

I boot from a USB-Stick (seems more reliable than SD-Cards), but other than that, its just a RaspiOS Lite (most recent image) with the latest Updates and nothing else.
