Crash in .NET application on Wine
This is probably pushing the boundaries a bit but I tried running Logos Bible Software 9 which is a .Net 4.8 app on my raspberry pi. I copied a working install from my x64 intel desktop. All config was the same as the working on. I got wine running to winecfg. The app launched and showed the startup splash screen and then crashed showing the attached terminal output.

The process was terminalted due to an internal error in the .NET Runtime at IP 0000000001345591 with exit code 80131506.
There is some little bit about the exit code here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/323834/executionengineexception-and-exit-code-80131506.html

I'm sorry I don't understand it though. I assume this is a bug in box64 because the program runs to a winehq silver standard on my desktop with kubuntu.

Alternatively could it be to do with dependencies etc? 

Any help much appreciated!
