[BOX64] Error loading needed lib stdc++.so.6
Hello! I'm trying to run an amd64 game with box64 on postmarketos on an (arm64) oneplus 6t.

I'm recieving this error (I'll give the whole log if someone can tell me how to redirect the output, I can't seem to do it even with `&>`):

A simple amd64 hello world binary does work fine.

Any troubleshooting help would be great, thanks!
