Quartus doesn't work on raspberry 
I wanted to install QuartusProgrammer-21.1 on my rpi using box64. Installation process went through without a problem but when I tried to run quartus I got a message:
```

The Quartus II software is optimized for the Intel Pentium III processor
and newer processors.  The required extensions were not found on:
''

The Quartus II software will not function properly on this processor model.
Terminating...
Error: Can not run the 64-bit Quartus II software on a 32-bit machine
```

Where I made a mistake? Have any idea?

I am working on Ubuntu MATE 22.04 LTS aarch64.
