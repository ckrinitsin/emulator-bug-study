Loss of function between v0.3.1 and v0.3.2 (VARA HF communications modem) with box64 & RMS Express
The mentioned modem, sadly closed source but available from https://rosmodem.wordpress.com/, appears to have been operationally broken between the two aforementioned versions (why I asked previously for v0.3.1 but found forked). The communications to/from the modem are done using internal TCP sockets. The startup involves some handshaking between the controlling program and the modem. When the modem is started, it checks its configuration file for a registration license. If the license is present and valid, the software will run. If the license check fails, the modem stalls out and will not run. This registration is in a readable .ini file. I ran a rather lengthy test of box64 using versions v02.8, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. This is how I found the fail to occur between v0.3.1 and v0.3.2. When running v0.3.1 and previous, the registration check works fine and the modem communicates. When running v0.3.2 and newer, the registration check process fails. Sadly, the modem software is closed because of security reasons. The issue lies strictly with the modem as I can elicit the fail response by doing a manual telnet session to the modem and typing in the proper command sequence by hand.

I am willing to be a guinea pig to try any changes out to see if this issue can be resolved. This modem package is used with the widely distributed Winlink2000/RMS Express radio mail package and service. The hardware that I am running is the RPi5/8GB under RaspiOS.
