Valheim server crashes soon after start
Valheim server crashes with

```
Thread 0xffff3c1c2020 may have been prematurely finalized
Setting up 2 worker threads for Enlighten.

```

It used to work on v0.2.2 so I'm guessing it was a Valheim update? I keep Valheim updated to latest release (and validated). The thread /#s change so I'm not sure how to get more info out of it.

These symbols are missing at the start:
```
Error: Symbol __atomic_load not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT @0xffff77fea150 (0x971876) in /home/valheim/valheim_server/valheim_server_Data/Plugins/libparty.so
Error: Symbol __atomic_exchange not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT @0xffff77fea158 (0x971886) in /home/valheim/valheim_server/valheim_server_Data/Plugins/libparty.so
Error: relocating Plt symbols in elf libparty.so
```

But I'm not sure they're essential and not sure if they were missing before Valheim updated.

This is installed on an Oracle AMPERE ARM instance. Also tested with latest commits (Box64 with Dynarec v0.2.3 0a558652 built on May  6 2023 21:34:16) and it didn't fix it. Box64 is built with `cmake .. -DRPI4ARM64=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`.

Let me know if there's something I'm missing or something I can do to get more useful info out of the crash! Thanks
