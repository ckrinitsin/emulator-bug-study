Celeste crashes with RISC-V dynarec enabled
Trying to run this on a Star64 (StarFive JH7110, 8 GB RAM) with an external GPU (Radeon HD 7870).
The game works up until the opening cutscene (with promising performance!), but once the level is going to load, it crashes with a `System.OutOfMemoryException`.

When running the game with `BOX64_DYNAREC=0`, it works, but of course very slowly.

This is on the current itch.io version of the game (1.4.0.0), box64 version [7bef7724](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/tree/7bef77248822262e1f36609c153d477c89fa9ebd).
