[WOW64] Drives not detected issue again :/
I can't get steam to work anymore with wow64 and I'm not sure if we should just focus on getting steam natively running instead of under wine instead. The first time I opened up winecfg everything looked normal the drives showed up then the second time I opened it up the theme was changed and I got the error message in the screenshot. DLL overrides wont save as well still also.
