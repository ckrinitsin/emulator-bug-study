wine: could not exec wineserver
```
i recieve the same error attempting to run notepad++ which i downloaded to check it wasnt just an issue with wine. the wine version in use is 5.21. Thanks

Note: my system doesnt support 32bit (and as of such box86) however since im using wine64 i dont think that will be an issue (not for this problem at least)
