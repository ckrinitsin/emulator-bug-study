Git project labels
It might be useful to add labels to GitHub Issues to help keep track of issues. Some initial ideas I had were:

- `x86_64`, `apple`, `arm`, `loongarch`, `powerpc`, and `risc-v` = Mention the CPU architecture.
    - Lots of existing reports for Apple Silicon hardware are instantly solved by using `muvm` to virtualize a 4K pagesize Linux kernel. We can better track these and work on documentation for them.
- `missing_library_native` = (I don't love this long name, by the way). The user needs to install a native library.
- `missing_library_nonnative` = The user needs to install a non-native library.
    - This will especially be useful soon as I want to track down and help bundle all of these libraries. Especially for Box32 where getting x86_32 libraries is tricky.
- `opcode` and  `wrapper` = A missing opcode or wrapper is needed.
- `epic`, `gog`, and `steam` = For games, label what store is being used.
- `box64` and `box32` = Depending on what architecture of the program a user is trying to use, it either relates to Box64 and/or Box32.
