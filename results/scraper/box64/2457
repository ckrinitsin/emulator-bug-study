Cannot use box64 because of missing libraries
Upon trying to run an x86 appimage, I get the error: x86_64-binfmt-P: Could not open '/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2': No such file or directory

I am using a RPi5 with x64 RPi os (the os was just recently reinstalled because I was getting the same error).

Box64 was installed from PiApps and then removed and recompiled from source. 

This error has occurred every time I have tried to use an application with box64.
