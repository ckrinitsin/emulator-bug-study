I tried to install this software on my system, but it requires libgtk3, because of the dependencies of the package, I cannot install it. So I used packages.debian.org to manually search for the library files I needed. Its took me an afternoon. In the end, although I completed all the runtime libraries,but I still got an error. This is the output.
