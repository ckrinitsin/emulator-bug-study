Incorrect strncat use
`strncat` function's third argument limits amount of bytes read from source (second arg), and not maximal allowed size of destination buffer (first arg) - https://linux.die.net/man/3/strncat

If `HOME` envvar has length 4095, then 8 additional bytes will be written outside of buffer by the `strncat`.

Moreover, `tmp` should be initialized with terminating nullbyte before call to the `strncpy` (because the last byte may be not-null, if not explicitly set), or the call should be `strncpy(tmp, p, 4096);` with additional null-termination after call to the `strncpy`.
