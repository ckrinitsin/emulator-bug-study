Running Bastion on VisionFive 2
Running Bastion on VisionFive 2 (using gl4es and emulated SDL2), the game screen is tilted 45 degrees. I read on this [post](https://magazine.odroid.com/article/playing-modern-fna-games-on-the-odroid-platform/) that gl4es supports running Bastion, so I'm guessing it might be a box64 issue. I don't currently have x86-64 Linux with a monitor available, so no way to verify for now.
