Steam fails with missing symbol under box64 on Snapdragon X Elite
## Summary

Hey folks!  First time poster - please route or ask for clarification as needed!  

I'm attempting to bring-up steam on a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x running a Snapdragon X Elite running Fedora Rawhide with Box64 (both from the RPM and from a locally-built binary).  

When running steam, installed via the `install_steam.sh` script in the box64 project, I get the following error:
```
[BOX32] Error: Symbol wctype not found, cannot apply R_386_JMP_SLOT 0x43737c8c (0xb4f770) in /home/gurnben/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steamui.so
[BOX32] Error: relocating Plt symbols in elf steamui.so
[BOX32] Error initializing needed lib /home/gurnben/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steamui.so
dlmopen /home/gurnben/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steamui.so failed: Cannot dlopen("/home/gurnben/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steamui.so"/0x52f5f140, 2)
```
I made sure to install the devel packages for gcc, cmake, etc.  Am I missing additional symbols?  Any suggestions on how to get around this issue?  

Thanks for all you do folks!

PS: I'm happy to do testing on Fedora or Ubuntu for Snapdragon X Elite for the project if that's beneficial!
