Android Termux support
On Android, you'll need to use Termux to emulate a Linux environment before you can use box64. Performance shouldn't be wasted on this.

The performance advantages of box64 over other transpilers should not be wasted.

Add Termux support to reduce deployment complexity and improve performance.
