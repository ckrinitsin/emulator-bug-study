Unimplemented Opcode (00 EB 0D 90) 64 86 8B 30 03 00 00 80 F9 02 75 2E 64 0F B6
While trying to run darwinia 10k (darwinia 10000th anniversary version) i ran into this problem.

In fact, the common log just says this:
```

```

and i'm unsure whether the crash-on-start is caused by the libz missing simbols or the unimplemented opcode, but i'm guessing it's the opcode.
