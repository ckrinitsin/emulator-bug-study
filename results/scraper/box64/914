Virtual Machine detection in Genshin Impact (VMProtect)
I'm trying to run Genshin Impact on Arch Linux ARM, which is running on a Snapdragon 888 SoC with Linux kernel v6.5-rc3. However, it will just say "*Sorry, this application cannot run under a Virtual Machine*". 

This particular wine build has also been tested on my desktop, and it can start genshin just fine.

After some search, I figured that the **VMProtect** being used in the game is causing the issue. Anything else using VMProtect [like this one](https://notabug.org/Krock/dawn/issues/12#issuecomment-27405) also pops out the exact same error dialog.

I'd be glad if anyone could help. Thanks in advance :P
