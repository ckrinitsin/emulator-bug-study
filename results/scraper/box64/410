random "Error: PltResolver: Symbol _dl_find_object(ver 18: _dl_find_object@GLIBC_2.35) not found" during minecraft bedrock server execution
I'm trying to run Minecraft bedrock dedicated server on android chroot arm64 and I get the following error, from time to time:

`Error: PltResolver: Symbol _dl_find_object(ver 18: _dl_find_object@GLIBC_2.35) not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT 0x7e319c0120 (0x7e319a4240) in libgcc_s.so.1
`
When it happens, the server freezes.

Is this something I can fix with libraries configuration or is it box64's fault?

Thanks in advance.
