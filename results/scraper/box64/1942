Frozen Depth roguelike not working
Frozen Depth roguelike game didn't start. Both ncurses and ncursesw versions.
I don't remember the exact error message, but something about the terminal not having enough rows and columns for the game to run. 

I ran it on my Pi3, which is now dusting on the shelf. If it's really needed, I can boot it up and post the full error log, but I think downloading FrozenDepth and checking it out is much faster.
