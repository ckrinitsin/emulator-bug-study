Can a host binary file be generated
I tried to use thebox64 to successfully run the example“hello x86 world!”, but I didn't see arm binary or intermediate files being generated. I can see that x86 binary files can be run directly on aarch64 architecture. Can I choose to generate binary files? Can one translation be reused?
Did I miss any information? Thanks a lot to help!
