Steam login menu not working
Hey!

I used the linux arm gaming chroot guide to run steam, and when I did, I ended up with this:
![borked login screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44118606/221372940-8d34150c-8eca-413f-93fa-3a36a6ccfa36.png)
I tried looking at the console output, which just complained about cef which I talked about in this issue https://github.com/Raezroth/Linux-ARM-Gaming-Chroot/issues/16
I tried -nocefsandbox and -oldbigpicture as well and no dice
here's the command I use to launch steam:
MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.2 PAN_MESA_DEBUG=gl3 steam +open steam://open/minigameslist -noreactlogin
any tips?
