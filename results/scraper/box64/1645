Are there some ways to check the wrapped functions?
I am now struggling with some weird bugs :disappointed:

My gui apps got stuck, and I saw **the last wrapped functions these apps called are all `calloc` and from `/usr/lib/libglib-2.0.so.0`**. The debug logs all looks like:

```txt

(( !stuck! ))
```

Even the gdb could not stop the programs when they got stuck.

I am now suspecting the function wrapping and I also see `calloc` wrapping seems good. So what I am actually suspecting is that maybe some functions wrappings are bad and affect the future behavior of the programs.

I see all the wrapping seemed to be created manually, so if the wrapping is buggy, the function calling from one library to another library can be buggy - I can imagine how difficult to debug such wrapping issue...

Could you help me to debug this issue? Thanks in advance!
