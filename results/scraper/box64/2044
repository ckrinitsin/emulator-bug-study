the problem with installing the steam
I read everything that could get into my hands about installing steam on jamm- Ubuntu as a result, I download it via lt 4, everything is installed, writes that I need to restart the device, I rebooted the result closer to the point. Steam should turn on itself or it should always be turned on at startup through box 64 if so, please tell me how to turn it on in advance thank you
