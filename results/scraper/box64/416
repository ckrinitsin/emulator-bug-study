Start application with service in Raspberry Pi
Hey, not a bug rather a question. I've tried making a service to launch the application and i can't seem to make it work. Just calling the bash script to launch the app itself is fine but not when making it a service. Is there a recommended way to just boot directly into the application and not see the desktop at all, ever? 

This is my service file, placed in /etc/systemd/system, done daemon-reload and tried starting with systemctl start, aswell as enable and rebooted.
```

StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=piservice
User=pi
Group=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/Services

[Install]
