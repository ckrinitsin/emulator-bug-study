Nordic Semiconductor nRF Util Trace utility unimplemented opcode error
Hi ðŸ‘‹,
I'm trying to use the nRF Util Trace utility from Nordic Semiconductor with Box64 on a Pi Zero 2 W with Raspberry Pi OS 64Bit.
This utility can convert LTE modem traces from a Nordic Semiconductor System-on-Chip into a pcapng file for Wireshark.
I came across this project since the manufacturer doesn't provide ARM native versions of their software for Linux (only macOS).

When I try to run a command which does this conversion, I get the following opcode error:

> 0660|0x1000a9b6a: Unimplemented Opcode (70 FD FF FF) 64 0F B7 43 4C 66 89 44 24 08 48 8D 7C 24 08

I use Box64 version 0.2.5 from the apt repository.

> Debug level is 2
Dynarec for ARM64, with extension: ASIMD CRC32 PageSize:4096 Running on Cortex-A53 with 4 Cores
Params database has 25 entries
Box64 with Dynarec v0.2.5 7f4145d6 built on Aug 29 2023 06:22:58

Steps to reproduce:

1. Download nRF Util `wget https://developer.nordicsemi.com/.pc-tools/nrfutil/x64-linux/nrfutil`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x nrfutil`
3. Download and install Trace utility `./nrfutil install trace`
4. Try to convert LTE modem traces to pcapng `./nrfutil trace lte --input-file com_data.bin --output-pcapng out.pcapng` This is where the opcode error occurs. The file com_data.bin represents a file which I have previously created with this utility on another system. I can provide a file upon request if it helps in the diagnostics of the issue.

Any assistance would be very appreciated. Thanks in advance!
