Decent Sampler Plugin
Hi, I've been trying to run the [Decent Sampler](https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/) virtual instrument through Box64. The system is Raspberry Pi OS (bookworm) 64bit on Raspberry Pi 5 8gb RAM. There are 2 Linux versions of Decent Sampler: static and dynamic. Static complains about libnghttp2.so.14 not being emulated/wrapped. No clue what effort would have to be made to fix that. Would someone have an idea? Dynamic fails because of a segmentation fault. The error message mean much to me, but I could share if interested.
