Loading x64 libraries from arm64 code
Hi. I make an application (OpenSteamClient), which is build with dotnet and C#.
This supports being natively compiled for arm64, x64 and lots of platforms. However an underlying library is only available as 64-bit or 32-bit (works the same regardless). 

Can box64/box86 be used with a native app to load a non-native library and have it work?

Sorry if this has been asked before, couldn't find anything on the topic.
