Precompiled builds no longer work. 
The instructions for ryanfortner precomp builds result in "Unable to locate package". 

Probably has to do with him redirecting his domain or something. 

Could I suggest making a pipeline or something for precompiled builds. I really dont want to have to compile anything on my raspberry pi because it takes forever.
