Minecraft bedrock server not lan-discoverable
When running minecraft's official bedrock server for linux on raspberry pi (I'm using specifically the pi 4 model b) through box64, the server is not discoverable by clients under the friends tab.

It does appear however if I run natively on x64 hardware or if I use an alternative bedrock server such as nukkit, leading me to conclude this is an issue with box64.

I am able to connect to the server directly, it just doesn't appear under LAN worlds. Is it possible that box64 is not handling multicast packets properly?
