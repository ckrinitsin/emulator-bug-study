box64 on m2 mac running asahi ubuntu pagesize error
i recently installed asahi ubuntu, a fork of asahi linux that runs ubuntu rather than arch, onto my m2 macbook air. i installed box64 through pi-apps and attempted to run an x86-64 .deb, but was given an error i havent seen before. its not an issue with this deb because i tried box64 on other debs and got the same error. this was the output of the console after trying to run the deb:

Dynarec for ARM64, with extension: ASIMD AES CRC32 PMULL ATOMICS PageSize:16384 Running on Blizzard-M2 Avalanche-M2 with 8 Cores
Params database has 27 entries
Box64 with Dynarec v0.2.5 bf6c6498 built on Sep 24 2023 06:16:36
Error: PageSize configuration is wrong: configured with 4096, but got 16384
[the output ends there]

if anyone knows what this means or how to fix it i would really appreciate it, as no one else seems to have this issue. thanks.

edit: i also tried installing box64 through the premade deb method from the compiling readme, and was given the same error.
