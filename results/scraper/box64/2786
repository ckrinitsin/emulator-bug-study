SVE (scalable vector extension) support
Hello there

Will there ever be support for scalable vector extension and scalable vector extension 2?

It will help with the emulation process of certain things

Especially the emulation of AVX instructions

Another emulator called fex-emu/fex core already has support for this armv8 feature it makes avx emulation redundant by using SVE and SVE2 for native or almost native level performance with AVX capabilities and features

Hope you'll consider this
