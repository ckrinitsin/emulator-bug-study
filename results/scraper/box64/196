Add support for 32-bit x86 apps on 64-bit only systems
I have a device which only natively has one architecture: ARM64. According to the README, Box64 supports this system. However, there is a limitation that it only supports 64-bit x86 apps (aka x86_64 or amd64). For running 32-bit x86 apps we'd need Box86, however, that software has a limitation that it only supports hosts with 32-bit support and not 64-bit only.

I would like to install one piece of software that allows me to run 32-bit x86 and 64-bit x86_64 apps while having a host that supports ARM64 and does not have any 32-bit ARM support. I understand if this feature request can't be done soon as I'd imagine this is a complicated request to implement.
