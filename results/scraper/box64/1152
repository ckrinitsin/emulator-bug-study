wine: wineserver doesn't support the 01c4 architecture
Hi,

I'm probably doing something stupid but I need some help. :grin: 

I'm building latest git HEAD b272f6bf15d on Debian bookworm with `cmake -DARM_DYNAREC=1` but when I run `box64 wine winecfg` I get this:

```

My wine version is 8.0~repack-4 and this is the amd64 binary of wine.
