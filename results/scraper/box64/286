[Discussion]Can i run QEMU-system on it?
well,i know this is a Strange idea .
But i still want to have a try.
i downloaded the qemu-system and it's dependency packagesâ€¦
unpack it using MT Manager
copy them to the Termux
run it
and nothing
no nothing
it told me a .so file can't be found(or can't be load?),but i already unpack it and BOX64_LIBRARY_PATH is correct 
how can i fix it?
