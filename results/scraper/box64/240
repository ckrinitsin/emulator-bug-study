terminating with uncaught exception of type std::bad_cast: std::bad_cast
I'm trying to run a Satisfactory dedicated server on ARM64 (4 cores 24gb of RAM). I'm using box64 and box86 to boot the server. Whenever I do, it crashes with this error message: " terminating with uncaught exception of type std::bad_cast: std::bad_cast". I was told to put this here, sorry if it's in the wrong spot.
