RISC-V Vector Extension Seems Not Working Well
## Description

I encountered a weird bug when running `lstopo` (https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/hwloc/) with box64 for _testing_. It raised `SIGILL` like this:

```

[1]    86920 illegal hardware instruction (core dumped)  ./box64 lstopo
```

I found that, if I turned off `rv64_vector` manually, this `SIGILL` would not occur. So it must be something wrong in box64 with `rv64_vector` enabled.

## Investigation

I did some investigation about this issue, and found that, if I disabled this translation via inserting `return 0` after `case 0x6C`, this bug would not occur.

Therefore, I think this instruction (`PUNPCKLQDQ`) is not processed correctly. However, GDB told me that illegal instruction did not come from this process, but from

Weird...

## Want Help

I am not familiar with both x64 mmx and riscv vector extension, and failed to find out where the bug is in the past 2 days, so I am sending this issue and waiting for help/fix.

I checked the history of these code lines, and found PR #1755, #1811 & #1816 are related.
