box64 as a shared library on Android
TL;DR Are there any open-source projects that compile and use box86/64 as a shared library?

I'm making a launcher for a java game on Android. I got java part figured out with an OpenJDK port, but the game also uses a few native libraries for physics and stuff. Those libraries are essential for the game and only come as x86/64 binaries. The idea here is for me to write stubs which will be loaded instead of those libraries and redirect calls to box86 emulator which loads the actual x86 libraries. The problem is that currently there is explicit support only for building box86 as an executable. I found a EXPORTDYN macro which is defined within BUILD_DYNAMIC and exposes some box86 functions, but the BUILD_DYNAMIC itself is not defined anywhere. I will figure out the inner workings of box86 eventually, but if you know of any projects which have already done that, it would save me a lot of time.
