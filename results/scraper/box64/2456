Any tips on building box64 in a memory constrained environment?
I'm trying to see if box64 will help me run an AppImage that for reasons can't be built on ARM. I'm on a Raspberry Pi 5 with 2GB ram and every time I try to build box64 and when following the [docs](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/docs/COMPILE.md) every time I try to run `make -j4` it gets to 100% and then stalls out, running out of memory and terminating.

I've tried everything I can think of to increase my total memory available (killing unnecessary process, allocation less to gpu, etc) but I just can't get the build to finish.

Does anyone have any tips on ways to get box64 to build when your memory is constrained?
