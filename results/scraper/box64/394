Box64 On Android
The Android device is faster than another arm64 devices(like respiberry 4B). 
So we can make a branch for android.
There are some errors to fix : 
1 . STB_GNU_UNIQUE , (ptitSeb is trying to fix it).  
2 .
 struct __jmp_buf_tag , It's a bug for Android NDK. So should I change <setjmp.h> and add these following lines ? (I didn't check)
` {
    /* NOTE: The machine-dependent definitions of __sigsetjmp'
       assume that a jmp_buf' begins with a __jmp_buf' and that
       __mask_was_saved' follows it.  Do not move these members
       or add others before it.  */
    jmp_buf __jmpbuf;		/* Calling environment.  */
    int __mask_was_saved;	/* Saved the signal mask?  */
    sigset_t __saved_mask;	/* Saved signal mask.  */
  };
//I collected it form GLIBC sources code.`
3. Another wrongs... 
I can't settle someone of them. @ptitSeb Can you see them?
