FNV strongmem issue one more time...
Hi Ptitseb and good day. I already wrote here earlier about the problem with Fallout New Vegas and Strongmem with huge fps drops at 1 value. It looks like I found a commit https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/8d0cc15eb0d078e5ae457bca8b11a31c28a96e27
 after which (as I see it) strongmem=1 became strongmem=2, before this commit, playing with strongmem 1 fps loss was only 5-6, but after it became 15.. I'm playing on the build dated January 29th and this is quite good if you don't take into account all the subsequent months of optimizations due to which FPS can be even higher.
and again, without strongmem 1 the game just dies randomly without errors within 1-15 minutes of playing.

I just want to play my favorite game on my old device, and I don’t have the money to buy a flagship yet to say “ha! who cares? I have a powerful enough processor to play even with Strongmem 3!”
