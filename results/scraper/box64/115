Is there a way to run Valheim dedicated server on Raspberry Pi 4 + steamui.so error
I've been trying for hours to make a Valheim server work on my Raspberry Pi 4 but couldn't. I've installed the 64bit version of the Raspberry OS, and I've installed both box86 and box64. I've encountered several problems. I cannot run Steam: I get a steamui.so fatal error. And I cannot install Steamcmd, because it's required to install `lib32gcc1`, but if I understand correctly I cannot install this library on a 64bit system. I was able to install Steamcmd through `wget` using a link I've found online, and I was able to install the dedicated server of Valheim with it. But when I try to launch the `start_server.sh` file, I get a bunch of errors and warnings (a lot of them mentioning `dlopen`). And the server eventually fails. 

Is there a way to do this? I've found an issue (#105) mentioning a bug but apart from that they where able to run the Valheim server. I would post more info and logs, but they got lost because I've tried to force 32bit libraries into the system and blew everything up. It was a fresh install anyway. And there is so much wrong is so many places I don't even know what to post.  I guess that the problem is the lack of libraries, but I couldn't find any info online on what to install, apart from `lib32gcc1` which cannot be installed, as far as I'm aware. The box64 and box86 installations should be correct, I've even restarted the service and the system several time.

Sorry from the vague post, but I really don't where to go from here.
