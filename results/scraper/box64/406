Crusader Kings II 3.3.3 crashes with invalid opcode
Hi,

trying to run Crusader Kings II 3.3.3 from steam version fail with the following unimplemented Opcode on Raspberry Pi 4. The error happens at soon as a single player game is launched with or without DLC.

Previous 32 versions (3.1.1) do work fully with box86. The current version is 64 bits only and launches with box64.

The same problem happens with Europa Universalis IV 1.32, roughly 3 minutes after launching a game. As Crusader Kings II is free on steam, I thought it would be a better case.

I understand this is something added lately from the developers. I just wanted to document the case, as the emulation is working on previous versions.

would you need a full debug log for his issue?

thanks a lot for all you work.
