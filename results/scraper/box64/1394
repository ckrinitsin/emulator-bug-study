Box64+Box86 Steam Unsupported Architecture aarch64
Didn't find a similar open issue, so I figured I would open one.

When trying to launch a lot of linux games on Steam I get the error "unsupported architecture aarch64" in terminal.
There are others that work fine, but I wonder why these do not play nice with Box64.
For example I tried "The Whispered World Special Edition".

Raspberry Pi 5
OS: Ubuntu 23.10
Built and installed Box64, Box86, and Steam.sh from github.
