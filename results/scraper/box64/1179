Unity Game: Keyboard inputs go to the console, not the actual game window
Hi there,

I was using Box64 to test a x86_64 runtime instance of my own Unity Engine-powered game on my 4GB Raspberry Pi 4B running Manjaro ARM Plasma edition.

After doing the required environment variable before the Box64 command to tell the game what OpenGL version to use, it booted up into my test menu after some initial delay. The test menu uses keyboard inputs to determine what options to load, etc.

However, I noticed that this wasn't working. When I pressed a Function Key like the ones F7 to F12, the functions key codes get spat out to the console, instead of actually being interpreted by the game. Mouse clicks seem to be registered, but I'm not so sure.

Right now, I don't have logs, but this doesn't seem to be the correct behaviour. Is there anything in particular I'm missing? The game does switch into fullscreen mode (non-exclusive, but borderless) at startup but to the KDE plasma environment, it doesn't "exist" as a "application window".

I'll try to get some logs as soon as possible. Thanks for any pointers in the meantime! ðŸ˜ƒ
