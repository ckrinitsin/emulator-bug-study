Steam for Linux sniper runtime environment crash
I am about to launch the Linux version of Counter-Strike 2, but I encountered a fatal error message that refers to the Steam for Linux runtime environment.

```

I went to the folder containing the Steam Linux Runtime, tried to launch it, and encountered a segmentation fault.

Both "run" and "run-in-sniper" are located under SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_sniper/

By the way, running CS2 with Steam-Proton under Box64 is okay but has poor performance. I am now attempting to run CS2 using the native Linux method.
