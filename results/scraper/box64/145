Warning: Cannot dlopen("/home/system/Downloads/WINE/usr/bin/../lib/wine/x86_64-unix/ntdll.so"/0x9e756cd0, 2)
I'm trying to use wine64, but when I try to run it, it crashes with `Warning: Cannot dlopen("/home/system/Downloads/WINE/usr/bin/../lib/wine/x86_64-unix/ntdll.so"/0x9e756cd0, 2)`. Does this mean that I should try to install WINE in my rootfs, not in a chroot?
