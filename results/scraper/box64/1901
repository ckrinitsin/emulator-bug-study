support for PGO optimization
i would like to see if box64(or box86) is possible to support pgo
maybe pgo can add performance for boxXX
but this may requires serious testing to see if this can help or not or worse
and when supporting this should be a flag that can be enabled like `-DWITH_PGO` or `-DENABLE_PGO`
