Unable to add reg key in a prefix created under emulation
When running `muvm box64 wine reg add 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\DllOverrides' /v "d3d8" /d native,builtin /f` in a prefix created under emulation I get `reg: Unable to access or create the specified registry key` but the same command on my x86 machine works fine, this makes installing and removing DXVK automatically harder.
