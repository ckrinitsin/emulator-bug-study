OS: Ubuntu 18.04
Device: Nintendo Switch L4T (tegra x1)
Ram: 4gb
Storage 90GB


Command: ```Steam -gamepadui```

FPS is unbearably slow on gamepadui for some reason
As shown on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzXYCmmcWy0&pp=ygUVZ2FtZXBhZHVpIHN0ZWFtIGFybTY0
the FPS is unbearably slow on the menu GUIs happening on my Nintendo Switch as well
