[box64] Error loading needed lib
Hi, I am trying to run an x86 based software on Raspberry Pi OS (essentially Debian) and it gives the following error:

```

Will use hardware counter measured at 54.0 MHz emulating 3.4 GHz

```

When I checked with `apt list | grep xxxlib`, I found that the libraries that were missing were all installed.

I don't know what to do next, hope to get help, thank you.
