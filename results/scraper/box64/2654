Black squares on window in VaraHF
Hi,

i am using an Orange Pi Zero 2W with OrangeOS (based on arch). I am using the latest VaraHF via Wine from aur package wine-tkg-staging-wow64-bin.

With the aur packge box64 0.3.4-2 it worked ok (but i could not use winetricks due to an error); so i switched to box-git (installed 30min ago). With that winetricks is working well, but I get black areas on my window. See attachment. 

As the version change of box64 made this happen, I chose to put the issue here. Any idea?
