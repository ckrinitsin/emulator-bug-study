[RV64] Implementing CALL/JMP
Seems that implementing CALL/JMP is quite challenging, as it involves dealing with cache and native call handling. @ptitSeb, would you be able to help us in implementing these instructions? For instance, if you could implement one of the CALL and JMP family instructions, then @xctan and I could proceed with implementing the rest.
