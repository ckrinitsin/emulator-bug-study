Failing to load libraries that are present in the current directory (as well custom directories specified in `BOX64_LD_LIBRARY_PATH`)
Used `termux-chroot` to compile box64 on Termux (natively) (device is non-rooted) (everything here was done remotely using ssh).
I attempted to run A Dance of Fire and Ice on my phone with the following libraries it asked for:

UnityPlayer.so
libm.so.6
libgcc_s.so.1
libpthread.so.0
libc.so.6

However it was only emulating the UnityPlayer.so and the other libraries weren't loading in. I've tried using the `BOX64_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environmental variable to specify the paths for the libraries but it only managed to load in UnityPlayer.so and libgcc_s.so.1 from `/usr/lib/box64-x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1`

All the other libraries were in the same directory as the UnityPlayer.so as well as some others in other directories since libc.so.6 and others weren't present on the system (so I downloaded them from an rpm).
