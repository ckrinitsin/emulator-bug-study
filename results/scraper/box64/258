Artifacts when running Unity build [ Ubuntu 21.04, 64 bit , RPI 400 ] 
Hey, getting weird artifacts(missing parts of the mesh etc) on 3D meshes and sprites in Unity. Running ubuntu 21.04 64 bit on a RPI 400. If i try running the executable with sudo it crashes and says "segmentation fault", without sudo it works fine. Has anyone had similiar issues?
