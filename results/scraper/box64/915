Problems running 64-bit GameMaker Games with Box64!
I'm having problems running 64-bit GameMaker Games with Box64. I tried booting up Ultionus with Box64 and ran into the following error message.
afro@odroidn2:~/Downloads/Games/Ultionus_RC6_1.0a_Ubuntu_NoSteam$ ./Ultionus
./Ultionus: error while loading shared libraries: libcrypto.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Next I tried replacing the libraries with x86_64 Libraries but it still didn't work.

afro@odroidn2:~/Downloads/Games/Ultionus_RC6_1.0a_Ubuntu_NoSteam$ cd lib
afro@odroidn2:~/Downloads/Games/Ultionus_RC6_1.0a_Ubuntu_NoSteam/lib$ file libssl.so.1.1

Lastly I tried aarch64 libraries, but unfortunately I'm still running into the same problem.
