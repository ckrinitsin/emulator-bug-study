Not issue! Just Request!
Dear developer!

Happy New year ðŸŽ‰

I have a request for Android community!

Can you add support for Android aarch64 application with `box64` & `box86` ?

If yes it will very helpful for `Android` users..
Like Android has old `exagear emulator` but it only supported `x86` platform and only can run `32bit` exc..

If you add Android application with box64 & box86
So we can develop a good Android emulator community with x64 & x86 `Boxemulator` Android..

I hope you can understand..
Source code exagear

Just for example & development purpose only..

Thank you
