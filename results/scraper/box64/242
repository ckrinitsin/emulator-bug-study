JIT for POWER?
Just tried this with the UT2004 retail binary on a ppc64le box, and the main menu came up without any notable issues.  It's **extremely** slow and quite stuttery (far worse than QEMU), but I'm assuming that's mostly because of the missing JIT for the ppc64le architecture,

Would you be interested in porting the JIT to ppc64le?  It's the only open ISA with high performance CPUs on the market, and we'd be happy to provide a free development box in return for the effort.

Thank you!
