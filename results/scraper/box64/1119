termux and steam fails with "Cannot dlopen("steamui.so"/0xe7a1e010, 2)" and symbols not found
I'm using termux and the set up from https://github.com/phoenixbyrd/Termux_XFCE on a Samsung Fold 4 that is currently running Android 13 and OneUI 5.1.1

When running from the debian proot setup. I installed steam via the install_steam.sh script in the box86 repository, cloned both box64 and box86 to my home directory and ran the following command. Below that is the part of the log that seems most relavant, seems like there are missing symbols.

```
BOX64_BASH=~/box64/tests/bash box64 steam
```
