This is a dedicated server for a unity based game. It's split into 2 executables (one is the game itself and the server "manager" is LocalAdmin). The server normally starts but there's a big issue. The LocalAdmin process lags after a while (uses 100% cpu and doesn't respond to any commands). It happens after "[39;49m[97mWarning, call to __cxa_thread_atexit_impl(0xffffbd0c5f60, 0xffff8c002b58, 0xffffbd9f9000) ignored" is typed into the console. As you can see from the logs below the server also spits random errors while just working.
