Vintage Story: Unimplemented opcode (00 41 FF E2) 0E 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 49 BA 4B E1 B6
HI, I'm trying to get vintage story running on my switch (performance will probably not be great, but I imagine this issue would exist regardless), and it runs into this error and crashes
`[BOX64] 6519|0xf83a0b36: Unimplemented Opcode (00 41 FF E2) 0E 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 49 BA 4B E1 B6`

I tried with Dynarec off, but it stopped way farther back, probably too slow to really do much.

Here are the full logs for both

Thanks.
