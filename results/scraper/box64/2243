Some games crash on boot
 Hi

My device poco f6 adreno 735.

Winlator glibc 7.1.4 on Android 14.

Wine 9.21.

Dxvk tried different versions same.

There's visual blur or bug idk in some games with commit a1ff407 . Don't occur in game only in menu and loading screens.

And starting with commit 0b2f84d , some games crash on boot. This issue is still in the latest commit I tested 99d0889. 

But not all games are 

NFS: MW 2012 and ACB crash on boot
GTA V works normally.

Here are the lines from the log after game crash:

[18:35:46] SPIR-V parsing FAILED:

Winlator won't export the log file.

I appreciate very much the hard work you're doing and I hope you have guidance and a success in your work and life.
