Trying to build Box64 inside an arm64 container
Hello, 

So for testing purposes I am trying to build box64 inside a CentOS-7 arm64 container running on my pc.

By default CentOS-7 has cmake-2.18, but i did install cmake-3.14, when I try to compile, it goes until the last step of linking and errors out with undefined references:

I have glibc-devel and glibc-static installed and I can find libpthreads and pthreads.h in PATH as well. Any ideas?
