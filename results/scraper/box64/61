Nvidia G-Sync demo
When trying to run the 64-Bit (Windows) version of the Nvidia G-Sync Demo from [here](https://www.nvidia.com/de-de/geforce/community/demos/) on box64 with Wine 6.0 upstream from PlayOnLinux, the demo crashes due to an unimplemented opcode:

`6014|0x10004f834: Unimplemented Opcode (00) 66 8C C8 66 89 43 38 66 8C D0 66 89 43 42 41`
