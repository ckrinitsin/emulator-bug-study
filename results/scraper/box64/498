does box64 run native on android environtment?
im wanted to compile box64 both box86 for rooted android phone (as magisk module). if possible just place box86 64 binary to /usr/bin (i forgot the path)?

 why me ask this. me using proot (busybox - linux deploy ubuntu 22.04), kalilinux nethunter root(proot - magisk module) and termux-proot(many limitation) have common issue when run bds server and wine slow when run with box64 (kali linux nethuner have wine 5.0 much stable on arm64)
