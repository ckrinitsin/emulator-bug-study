Error loading needed lib libpulse-mainloop-glib.so.0
Hello, I'm trying to run a Valheim server on a Pi 5. I got it working for the most part. However, it seems to fail when loading this library which causes it to crash.

```sh

The server seems to run fine up to the point where I can connect locally, but crashes shortly after connecting. 

Not sure if this helps, but I'be also done the following:

* Converted page size from 16k to 4k
* Installed box64 with these flags `DRPI5ARM64=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`
* Converted server script to run as `systemctl` service. It just freezes and fails to detect it crashes.
* Installed `testing`, `experimental`, and `unstable` versions of `libpulse*` libraries
