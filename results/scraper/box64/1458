Barony game need SDL_GameControllerHasRumble to accept a joypad
Hello all,

The game Barony v 4.02.2023.09.24 will work with Box64 on RPI5. Some graphics will be black until a LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE=1 is applied.

However, starting it with a joystick that has rumble function will result in this error message:

```
Error: PltResolver: Symbol  SDL_GameControllerHasRumble(ver 0: SDL_GameControllerHasRumble) not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT 0x1009ac108 (0x100109216) in /mnt/local/Jeux/Barony/game/barony.x86_64 (local_maplib=(nil), global maplib=0x415392e0, deepbind=0)
```
Here is the native/emulated log:
```

As I see some SDL gamecontroller functions are added in the latest commit, may I ask for this one so I can see if it is fully functional with a controller and enable 2 player split screen?

Thanks
