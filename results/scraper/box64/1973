[BOX32] Add binfmt support for 32-bit applications
Currently, Box64 only works for x86_64 applications automatically via `binfmt`. It looks like that configuration file is dynamically generated by CMake.

Perhaps there can be a new build option `-D BOX32_BINFMT=1` to additonally enable support for x86_32 applications. Leave it off by default since it can conflict with Box86. Box32 is also still in early stages of development.
