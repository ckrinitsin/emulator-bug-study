BUNDLE-X86-LIBS.md instructions can lead to a system failure
Hi,

Just a little pointer as I falled for this this morning:

Instructions for running bundle-x86 say : Run box64-bundle-x86-libs.sh

Even if this is in the administrator section, it is not implied it must be done as root. One this is run as user, it will create libs and folders with user ownership. 

The next instruction : `sudo tar --extract --file box64-bundle-x86-libs.tar.gz --directory /`
will extract the libs with subfolder ownership to the user. The result is a root, /usr and /usr/lib becoming user ownership, and the system will fail for many components (Bluetooth LE, /dev, nftables for example) but not enough to see the mistake immediately.

I suggest modifying to a method that cannot lead to a change of usr and /usr/lib ownership.

For people having the problem, diagnosis is done by doing 
`ls -asl / `
You will see your username next to .. and /usr

you can do:

```
sudo chown root:root /
sudo chown root:root /usr
sudo chown root:root /usr/lib
```

To correct it and reboot.
