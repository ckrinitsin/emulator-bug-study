Layers of Fear crashing
Looks like after recent fixes Layers of Fear is close to start, at this moment I was able to go in-game with variables `BOX64_NODYNAREC=0x111111-0x1111111` and `-force-opengl`.

Issues with internal strorage driver of Poco F1 makes it too annoying to continue cracking issue on it. If I find time, I'll retry on Jetson Nano.
