[RPi4] BotVice - missing libssl symbol
While running BotVice, it would seem libssl is missing the 'SSL_load_error_strings'.

Run under the same circumstances as ScourgeBringer. While I've SSL_load_error_strings in the past it's the first time it's a showstopper.

Edit : Similar issue running Nuclear Throne with box86. This may come from the Goldberg emulator when games require specific Steam functions. If that is the case however I feel like wrapping this function would probably be beneficial. This is the best way to run Linux-native Steam games on ARM-based devices, especially low-end ones where you actively don't want the Steam client running in background.

here is the end of the BOX64_LOG=2 log (I can upload the whole thing if needed) :

Edit 2: Just to further confirm, box86 suffers from the same missing wrapped function in libssl. Should I create another issue for box86 or should I consider that any missing function for either one will be wrapped for the other as well when creating an issue ?

After looking at libssl's wrapping, load_error_strings seems to be wrapped, so I'm not sure about why this happens. I'll compile an up-to-date libssl and try again !
