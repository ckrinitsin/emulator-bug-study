Nintendo switch steam being weird
Hello I just swapped over from bionic to jammy because it could not run steam on switch without me setting up a swap file so I got steam working and I'm trying to launch yomi hustle which is not a very intensive game and it just kind of sits on the screen for 15 mins not doing anything I was wondering what I could do to fix this or make it faster I would also like to note that I begun to hear music for like 30 seconds before the entire switch crashed
