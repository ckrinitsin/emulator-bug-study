Gamepads work incorrectly in Unity games
I tried to run Streets of Rogue and Tangledeep. Both games written in Unity and works fine, except gamepad buttons work incorrectly. I tried two gamepads: Xbox Wireless Controller (works properly using https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo dkms driver) and GameSir X2 Pro (configured it with xboxdrv). Both work fine in other native games and in Iconoclasts (not a Unity game). And Xbox Wireless Controller works fine on PC with the mentioned two games (and configured the same way via xpadneo). So I suspect that it could be an issue with box64. I use version 0.2.
