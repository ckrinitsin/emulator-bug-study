Fallout New Vegas crashes very often
The crash occurs in the first 1-5 minutes of the game, experimentally I found out that the problem is in box86 (and 64 too), STRONGMEM=1 solves the problem, but the FPS drops quite a lot, and I remember well how six months ago I played this game without STRONGMEM and game didn't crash.
