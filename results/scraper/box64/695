[RPi4] Wine64 fails half of its executions
When running wine64, half of its executions fail with a crash. Usually after a failed execution the next execution succeeds, and after a successful execution, the next one usually fails.

I made two consecutive logs, one failing, one with success and then recorded another fail using box64's log level 2 !

Here are the logs :
[winelog_success.txt](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/11221995/winelog_success.txt)
[winelog_fail_loglevel2.txt](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/11221996/winelog_fail_loglevel2.txt)
[winelog_fail.txt](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/11221998/winelog_fail.txt)
Hopefully these are helpful, tell me if you need any other log with other parameters !
