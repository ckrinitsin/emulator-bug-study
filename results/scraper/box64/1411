Required file not found in the Beyond All Reason appimage on M1
When using the fedora package box64-asahi it gives me `Error loading needed lib libgcc_s.so.1` and when compiling the latest version it says `/tmp/.mount_BeyondjBuxXM/AppRun: line 43: /tmp/.mount_BeyondjBuxXM/beyond-all-reason: cannot execute: required file not found`
