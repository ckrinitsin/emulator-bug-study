Zoom is broken due to libcef dependency
Hello. I will get some debug information soon here, but I wanted to post this report since I am not using my Rapsberry Pi 400 as a desktop computer at the moment.

It seems that, at some point recently, Zoom started using libcef in it's desktop app. This seems to completely break it on box64 (and I imagine the same for box86).

Again, I am going to setup my Pi and get a stacktrace to put here within the next few hours. I have other things to do at the moment though.

Thank you for continuing to work on this!
