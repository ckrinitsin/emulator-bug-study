Unsupported Syscalls collection
As the topic

cur my uns syscall:
```
0000|2023-08-02 21:18:05 [I] launcher Error: Unsupported Syscall 0x3Bh (59)
```
`Error: Unsupported Syscall 0x10Ch (268)`
### And A question:
~and it uses go, saying errorno 2 when reading not existed files~
The program will `segment fault`/`exit`, and when i run it repeatly it final shows file read err, will it exit too fast by processing by box64?
