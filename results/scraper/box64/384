Runtime pagesize
ARM64 kernel supports 3 kinds of page sizes: 4K, 16K and 64K, and it's an option when building kernel.

RHEL-derivatives uses 64K page, most embedded things use 4K and Apple uses 16K.

To ship box64 as a generic distribution, it could be beneficial to support all page sizes dynamically.
