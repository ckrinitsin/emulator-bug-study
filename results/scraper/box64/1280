Werid warning while using native(wrapped) libEGL.so.1
I'm running apps on Pioneer Box (RISC-V). 

When I ran the wemeet with box64, the following very strange warning appeared

```
Using native(wrapped) libXinerama.so.1
Using native(wrapped) libpulse.so.0
Using native(wrapped) libudev.so.1
Using native(wrapped) libEGL.so.1

```

Why does loading the libEGL.so.1 library go to libGL.so.1 to look for egl related functions, they're obviously already wrapped.

Please help.
