Burnout Paradise The Ultimate Box does not display shadows correctly
I originally thought that this was a driver issue, but I'm starting to think that this is a box64 issue. I cannot find any gameplay online that runs on Android, whether that be with Winlator, termux-box, gamefusion, etc. I've tested this game with multiple different emulators and they all display the same issue. I've also used multiple different devices, as well as different drivers and nothing changes. The game on low shadows disables shadows, but when switching to medium or high, the game looks exactly the same. The shadows are rendering somewhere, as increasing the shadow quality impacts fps and increases gpu utilization, but the game doesn't actually look any different.

Here is the log file. I am using box64 0.3.3 5dadc51. I've noticed that once getting into the game, box64 will produce an error every 10 seconds saying "020c:fixme:powrprof:PowerGetActiveScheme (00000000,2EFEFF1C) stub!" Sometimes it's slightly different, but it's the same type of error, if that makes sense.
