Wine Wrapping Question
since there is a native version of Wine for Arm Linux, would it be advantageous or faster to wrap the Dependencies in Arm Wine as X86/X64 to speed up programs running under Wine on linux instead of essentially emulating an x86/x64 Wine Environment? What would the Drawbacks be, and more importantly, can it be done in the first place?
