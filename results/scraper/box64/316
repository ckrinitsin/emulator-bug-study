Very poor performance and spikes on Factorio
Here are two benchmarks with and without box64, is this normal? Is this the expected performance or is there an issue I am not seeing?

I have also seen many hiccups and performance spikes with Factorio servers.

I am running Oracle Ampere A1 Server CPUs.
