Bug: Steam's launcher not launching even though login into a user thats not root (GNOME Edition)
Steam's launcher not launching even though login into a user thats not root
i cant launch steam launcher as i was trying to test if steam even runs and works properly but it just says that it cant run as root user even though i login into a user thats not root
-Run the steam launcher
-Get error "cannot run as root user"
-Switch to a user
-Run the steam launcher
-Get the same error even though not being in the root user.
giving me the "cannot run as root user" even though i am not in the root user
