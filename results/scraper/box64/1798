SeaMonkey Browser - Only Linux x64 - Won't start
Hello everyone.
I'm trying to use Box86 to run a non game App from Linux, for Intel Arch (64 Bit) on Termux Proot Distro.
I'm getting this error:
`Error: PltResolver: Symbol  gdk_disable_multidevice(ver 0: gdk_disable_multidevice) not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT 0x3f16b8b5c0 (0x3f109d5266) in /home/ivix/Downloads/seamonkey/libxul.so (local_maplib=(nil), global maplib=0x36c9fed0, deepbind=0)`

for this command line:
`box64 seamonkey`

Please, help.

Thanks in advance for any help. Regards, have a nice day.
