Error loading libxcb-render.so.0 while running Ruffle
I have libxcb and libxcb-render installed on my Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Raspberry Pi 4, 64-bit OS).

I tried to run Ruffle from the official nightly build, and box64 seems to fail to load libxcb-render, although the package and the file is in `/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/`. Below is the terminal log of the run.
```
$ box64 ./ruffle

I have seen through past issues, and it seems that @ptitSeb wrapped that certain package to solve it. If you could this time, please do it. At the meanwhile, if there are other solutions, please tell me. Thank you!
