Respondus Lockdown Browser - needs libgnutils.so.30 fixed
I am running a browser under wine which should work according to winehq.
https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?bShowAll=true&bIsQueue=false&bIsRejected=false&sClass=version&sTitle=&sReturnTo=&iId=42004
I tested this on a x86 linux laptop and it does indeed work after doing `winetricks allfonts msftedit`.
However, using the latest box64 with wine wow64 (as seen on Pi-Apps), the program cannot detect internet.
I think this is the issue: the output repeats this message about 20 times, right before the error dialog appears.
```
Look for gnutls_pubkey_import_dh_raw in loaded elfs
Warning, function gnutls_pubkey_import_dh_raw not found in lib libgnutls.so.30
```
