Does Box64 require me to have both arm64 and x64 libraries with the same abi?
Hello,

I could not find any information on this . I will be testing some scientific programs using box64. I have a rhel/centOS rootfs i can use that I can point to. My question is, would I also need the arm equivalent as well?  So would I need to run this on a arm64 based redhat system ? I ask because the program of Interest are closed source and only work on rhel version of common libraries. 

Thanks
