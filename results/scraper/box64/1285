Unknown architecture :- add "DEC Alpha"
Afternoon, now this is a bit niche, legacy and potentially too slow to be useful at all. (top end processors were around 1Ghz only), but there is a 64bit architecture not represented in the list. 

Is it possible to add the DEC alpha? Or is there some "generic" option  I could use to avoid "unknown architecture". 

Cheers,
Chris
