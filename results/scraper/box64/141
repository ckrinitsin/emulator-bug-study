HollowKnight not launching on Pinebook Pro
I recently installed the box64 package from AUR on my Manjaro Pinebook Pro and I wanted to try out the capabilities of the software with HollowKnight which seems to wokr on other platforms but it doesnt seem to be able to start on the Pinebook Pro.

I am using;
Box64 with Dynarec v0.1.5 289deb3 built on Oct 10 2021 17:09:09
Mesa 21.2.3-1
Linux Kernel 5.14.12-1
Latest HollowKnight version from GOG
The hardware I'm using is a Pinebook Pro

Here is the log I get zhen I launch the game:
[box64.log](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/7384274/box64.log)

Then here is the log I get when I launch the game with BOX64_LOG=2:
[box64_log2.log](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/7384282/box64_log2.log)

And finally here are the Unity player logs:
[Unity_Player.log](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/7384286/Unity_Player.log)

I hope my issue can help improve this fantastic software, if you need me to do more test don't hesitate to ask me.
