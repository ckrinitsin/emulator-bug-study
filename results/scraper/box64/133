Controllers in Deltarune Cause Segfault
I've tested on my x86_64 pc and controllers work fine.
When using box64, downloading the gamecontrollerdb.txt file from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt
and placing it in the assets directory causes the program to segfault.

I've linked an archive with the gamecontrollerdb.txt not present so deltarune should launch with box64 initially (note: deltarune ch1/2 are free).
