Factorio: Unimplemented Opcode (02) 64 66 89 3C 25 D8 FF FF FF BF B0 C2 B4 01 64
As per the title, I received an unimplemented Opcode error upon trying to save a game.

That's from the Terminal. I can try to get you something better, log wise, if you tell me how.


EDIT:
For those curious, Factorio does work pretty well with some config changes, on the Pinebook Pro. I think most of hte issues -- other than saving because of the opcode issue -- are related to the Panfrost driver.
