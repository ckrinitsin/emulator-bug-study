### Welcome to ./babyrev_level12_testing1!

This license verifier software will allow you to read the flag.
However, before you can do so, you must verify that you are licensed to read flag files!
This program consumes a license key over some communication channel that you must figure out.
You must also figure out (by reverse engineering this program) what that license key is.
Providing the correct license key will net you the flag!
Unfortunately for you, the license key cannot be reversed. You'll have to crack this program.

I don't know why and how to fix it. Can you guys help me with this issue?
