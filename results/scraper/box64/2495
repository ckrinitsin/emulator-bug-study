[BOX32] Feature request : support for x86_64 target
Hello,
This might sounds silly in a first place, but what about having a x86_64 dynarec leveraging Box32 in order to run x86 (32-bit) applications on x86_64 targets ?
Box64/32 allows to not bundle a full rootfs and this is a huge advantage in my opinion.
