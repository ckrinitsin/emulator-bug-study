[Discussion] Use a separate emulation backend for loading 32-bit libraries?
Hey I had this idea of incorporating qemu-user or unicorn emulator into box64 specifically for loading 32-bit libs. Could be useful for loading Steam without having to use a 32-bit operating system with box86. Might be complicated, but if someone can tell me where the library loading part of box64's source code is I'd like to start looking into it myself.
