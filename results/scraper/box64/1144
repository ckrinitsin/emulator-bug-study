Box64, 86
help me please.  I want to create my own Linux prefix in Termux and I want to make it as light as possible.  Can I get a complete list of dependencies for Box86 Box64?  For example, if there is no libFLAC.so.8, then the games will not start.  what libraries are needed for maximum compatibility?
