Steam on raspberry pi 5
Hello guys. Im totally green in Linux and raspberry pi. I wanted to tinker a bit to learn it and i get a challenge from my friend to install steam on raspberry pi 5 as he said he tried in the last version and failed. 

I followed this guide:  https://www.xda-developers.com/install-steam-on-raspberry-pi/
I am using exactly the same system (Ubuntu 23.10)
I went through all the steps and didnt receive a single error, everything went slowly but smoothly.

When i try to launch steam i am getting this error
