error: unknown type name '__uint128_t'
When trying to compile using the make -j$(nproc) command, I keep encountering the following error:

error: unknown type name '__uint128_t'

I have followed all of the steps listed on [pymylifeup](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-x64/) to the letter and am curious what may be causing this problem. I am currently running Raspbian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye). 

Please let me know if you need any additional information. I have attached a text version of the compiler output to this issue if that helps.
