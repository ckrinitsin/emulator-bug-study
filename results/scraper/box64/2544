(Request) Variables to Use CPUs in Specific Modes
box64 already has a "box64_maxcpu" variable, but it doesn't work for this situation I'm about to show.

In all my time playing games in box64, I've noticed that some games use two cores, others use one core, others use four cores, and others use three cores.

Having all the cores selected can cause the game to run poorly, since I select the first cores, and the first cores on Android are low-power, meaning they save battery life, so they have poor performance.

This can be solved by opening Task Manager and selecting the most powerful cores.

But I would like to have a variable to avoid opening Task Manager every time I open a game.

For example: BOX64_MAXCPU= 8-6,7,5 or BOX86_MAXCPU= 8-6,7,5

Of the 8 cores, select cores 6, 7, and 5.
