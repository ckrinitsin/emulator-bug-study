X Error of failed request:  GLXBadFBConfig
I trying to run a free game [Street Fighter™ X Mega Man™](https://megaman.capcom.com/sfxmm/sfxmm_dl_uk.html). I already tried it before in #860 the game didn't work with Wine 8.11.

But the game now works with Wine 8.12, I tested it on my PC. I downloaded Wine from https://github.com/Pi-Apps-Coders/files/releases and used the same binary on my PinePhone Pro.

I run it as usual: `box64 path/to/wine SFXMMv2_EU.exe`.
But have the error mentioned in the title. 
Full output: [log.txt](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/12123096/log.txt)


I use box64 compiled from 51cbb7e1fb6efc6e74c04d7d31dc05f074646771.
