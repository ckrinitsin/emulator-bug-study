A function __wine_get_unix_opcode is unimplemented in skeleton WoW64 wrapper code.
You should implement the C function (void* WINAPI __wine_get_unix_opcode(void)), If you want to use the wowbox64 on AArch64 wine.
the "void* WINAPI __wine_get_unix_opcode(void)" function provides the address of the syscall routine function which need for the Wine specific routines, for example calling OpenGL for Directx emulation and calling ALSA Audio for Win32 Audio emulation, in the Winelib under WoW64 emulation layer.
The Gocaine-xtajit's wrapper code could be useful as a reference for implementing this.
The source code of the Gocaine-xtajit's wrapper code is available at " https://github.com/hiroki-repo/Gocaine-uni-xtajit/blob/main/dllmain.cpp "!
