[BOX32] [Winlator] Keyboard input problem in Wine games
Wine 9.13 bi-arch on Winlator.
Box64-Box32: [6d1e30c](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/6d1e30cd3c0060a914b2bde43e7c8d832207e202)
Issue:  In Wine games, the keyboard input (buttons _A-Z_, _0-9_) do not work or are mixed up. 
Other keys work fine (Enter, Space, Shift, Ctrl, Alt, arrows, etc.).
However, keyboard input works fully in programs (wordpad etc.).
