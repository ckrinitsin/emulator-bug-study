Slower Box64 startup time on AWS Graviton2 compared to Raspberry Pi 5
Hello, I'm new to box64 and currently experimenting with it. I noticed that Box64 startup time is slower on my setup (Graviton2) compared to a Raspberry Pi 5 demo.

In this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/f7a7sJF3lYo?si=qcrfVxMr-UC6oIoU&t=462), Box64 appears to launch a Factorio server in about 2 seconds on a Pi 5. That setup follows the [PiMyLifeUp guide](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-x64/).

I'm measuring the time from whenI press enter to when the first factorio server log show up.

I did the same setup steps on an AWS EC2 instance (Graviton2 / Neoverse N1, Ubuntu 22.04, 6.8.0-1029-aws), but the startup takes about 7 seconds instead.

I built box64 with 
`cmake .. -DARM64=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`

Hereâ€™s my CPU info:

Both Pi 5 and Graviton2 are based on Cortex-A76, so I expected similar performance.

Is there anything I can try to reduce startup time?

Thanks!
