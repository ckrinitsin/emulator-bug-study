Grand Theft Auto V
Grand Theft Auto V currently fails to boot, using Wine 6.0 upstream from PlayOnLinux with
`0140:err:module:open_builtin_file failed to load .so lib "/home/grima04/wine/lib64/wine/l3codeca.acm.so"`
I haven't seen any other errors though like unimplemented opcodes or missing functions.
