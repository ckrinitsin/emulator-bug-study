[LA464] Dynarec writting
I started writting a Dynarec for the LongArch architecture, and some of the code can be seen in current Box64 code. 
However, I don't have access to any LongArch machine anymore and so cannot conitnue this port.

It's a shame because there is a lot of synergy between this and the ongoing RISCV effort actually going on. Some of the chalenge (like the sign extension for 32bits values) are shared, so developping both dynarec at the same time would make sense.

For this, I need access to a LongArch machine (preferably a physical machine, as remote machine are slow to the point it make develepment awkward).
