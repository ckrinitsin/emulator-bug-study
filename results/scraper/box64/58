Some noob programmer asking about architectures
I have a rpi 4b 4gb with arm64 os installed. I want to use box86 and box64, BUT I need a different os for box86. Why?
If this project only translates from one architecture to another (Also more things, I know), why not creating a "mix" detecting x86 or x86_64 and executing that?
I don't know why, just asking
:D
