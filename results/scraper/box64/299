VCV Rack: __cxa_pure_virtual symbol not found and dlopen() discrepancies
Trying to run VCV Rack on Pine64. Self compiled from git.
I've extracted libjack.so.0 and libdb-5.3.so from the amd64 deb packages and put them in the working directory.

The following error message is repeated many times with different addresses when the program starts:
```
Error: Symbol __cxa_pure_virtual not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_64 @0xffff989aee88 ((nil)) in libRack.so
```
It then crashes when the audio processing is supposed to start with an unimplemented opcode error:
`6654|0xffffb431f1b0: Unimplemented Opcode (00) 66 0F 38 3F C1 66 41 0F 7E C6 4D 89 F7 85 D2`
[Paste with LOG=2 including some context](http://paste.debian.net/1239752/), error appears at line 116.

Cool thing is [VCV Rack is open-source!](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) In fact some work has been done to compile it and many of its plugins for arm64, although closed source modules aren't available for arm64, hence my attempt.

Thanks for any help!
