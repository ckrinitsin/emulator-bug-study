Artifacts and some lag when running Unity build
[Link](https://gyazo.com/a7a703ca5d6624c67bf3aafc8c2ec2a7) to a gif showing the issue. I'd also say that theres some lag when running. Could be related? I'd want to try and overclock but I've got no heatsink currently. 

Running `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.2` everytime.
Using ` BOX64_DYNAREC=0` or `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true` shows no improvement. 

edit:
I accidently had the player quality settings to ultra, changing them to low or very low made the performance excellent.
