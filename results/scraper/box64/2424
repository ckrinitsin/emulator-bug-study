[WoW64] No drive detected on fresh install
My whole linux partition was unbootable after an update and after reinstalling everything even my old good prefix from an x86 machine won’t work. In winecfg it doesn’t see any of my drives. The only thing I can see in the logs is `[BOX64] Warning, Symbol wine_main_preload_info not found`
