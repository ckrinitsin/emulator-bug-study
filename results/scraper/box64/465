Wine64 Wow64 (32bit thunks on 64bit unix) crashes on load
Wow64 is complete now with the wine 7.22 release. win32 programs can run under 64bit linux without any 32bit userspace.

unforntunatly this doesn't seem to be working under box64 and crashes on launch with everything I try. A simple program notepad++ win32 version
