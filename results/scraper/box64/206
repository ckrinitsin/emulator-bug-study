SIGSEGV when running KSP
On running this command:
`$ box64 KSP.x86_64`
I get this output:
[output.txt](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/7833273/output.txt)
In the GUI, KSP says it is loading "Asset Bundle Definitions", I left it for over and hour with no progress.
The CPU stays maxed the whole time.
As soon as it tries to load the "Asset Bundle Definitions", the SIGSEGV happens.
