Zoom Problems
This is not a code issue, but a more far reaching one. The ram element is mainly bizarre QT libs that you have to emulate.

I have box64 for running Zoom-x86_64. The size is increasing exponentially.  The ram element is mainly bizarre QT libs that you have to emulate. So you are going to have to be more economic with memory. Let me give you some versions and figures 
Zoom-5.9.6 took 55MB of disk space. Then Zoom set a threshold at 5.10.3, and I had to update.
Zoom-5.10.7 took 120MB of space. I got this running by installing a 2GB swap file. Startup time was 2 full minutes until things appeared. It ran on the 4GB ram & most of the 2GB of swap with all 4 cores working hard.

Now Zoom have set a new threshold of 5.14.? I downloaded for my pc and got 5.15.10. That takes up 654MB of disk space :-O!
