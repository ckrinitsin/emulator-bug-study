Function parameters of type XID in libX11
I noticed that most functions in libX11 with a parameter of type `XID` list it as `p` in their signature, but `XSaveContext` lists it as `u`. `XID` is defined as `unsigned long` in *wrapped/wrappedlibx11.c*. Should the `XID` type be `L`, or is `p` correct? I assume `u`is wrong in any case.
