Sniper elite 4 wont launch at all
Hi Dev, I tried sniper elite 4 on box64droid (native wow64, and chroot), mobox native wow64, and winlator.

and the launcher launch perfect, but the thing is after I hit play button on the launcher, the game appear on taskmgr and disappear after few seconds.

I'm using many wine version from 8.0 till 9.4 wow64
still doesn't work at all.

and I'm trying the box64droid with box64 updated

idk what is the problem, here's my log
thanks Dev
