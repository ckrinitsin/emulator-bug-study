Previous conversation:
ptitseb:
Does this log is with BOX64_SHOWSEGV=1 env. var.? It seems not, there is no box64 logs there.

Me:
OK sorry, i will Transfer this over, and delete it Here.
To the Log Thing:
Well if there are no box64 logs then that means that the BOX64_LOG or BOX64_SHOWSEGV or both don't work. He has them enabled and He ran the games. Weird
