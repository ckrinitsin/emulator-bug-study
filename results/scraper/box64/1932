Unimplemented Opcode (47 0B 00 00)
Hi,

first of all: thanks for box64/86! It's a very powerful tool on an RPi!!!

I don't know if it's ok if I open an issue here for every unimplemented opcode, but I'll try. If not, that's ok and I'll sit quietly in the corner and cry to myself :)

This is what I am getting when trying to run `ArmaReforgerServer`:

```
14413|0x117c4c9: Unimplemented Opcode (47 0B 00 00) 64 F6 85 64 F6 FF FF 04 0F 85 6D 02 00 00 45
Sigfault/Segbus while quitting, exiting silently
```

Hope this can be easily fixed.

Thanks a lot!

Holger
