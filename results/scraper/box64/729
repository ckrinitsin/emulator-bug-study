Falied to connect to the mount manager (Termux, POCO X3 Pro)
Hi, I using Wine 6.0 in box64. When I try go to "Drives" in winecfg tab I got "Falied to connect to the mount manager", in box86 all seems fine. In terminal I have this:
`0298:err:winecfg:open_mountmgr failed to open mount manager err 2`
But when I launched same Wine on notebook (already built box64 for x86_64) drives mounted fine. There is a box64 or proot problem?
