packaging for Debian
Hi,

I packaged box64 for Debian here: https://salsa.debian.org/debian/box64/

One of the problems I encountered was, that box64 tries to install files that are owned by the `libgcc-s1:amd64` and `libstdc++6:amd64` packages, namely `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1` and `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6`, respectively. This is a bit of a bummer because this means that the arm64 box64 package will have to conflict with both amd64 libraries. This in turn will make it impossible for a user who wants to install box64 to install any amd64 packages making use of the amd64 gcc and C++ libraries.

Why is this important? Proprietary amd64 Debian packages that I'd like to try running with box64 will also depend on the gcc and C++ library packages. If the arm64 box64 package conflicts with the amd64 libraries, then I will be unable to install proprietary amd64 packages that I want to use with box64 to avoid having to use super slow QEMU user emulation.

I wonder: do you think there is a way for the arm64 box64 package to co-exist with the amd64 gcc and C++ libraries?
