executable bit on source code, documentation, images and more
Hi,

the executable bit is set for many files in this git repository. You can find them using:

    find . -type f -executable -print

This includes C code, header files, markdown documentation, PNG images, CMake files, config files and more.

Is this an oversight or intentional? I can file a pull request removing the executable bit.
