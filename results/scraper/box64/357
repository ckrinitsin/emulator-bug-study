/usr/bin/cc - broken when cmake -DRPI4ARM64=1
Hi! I was following this tutorial: https://www.reddit.com/r/valheim/comments/s1os21/create_your_own_free_dedicated_server/

Like written in the post, I'm running a `Linux instance1 5.15.0-1013-oracle #17-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jun 24 10:14:16 UTC 2022 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux` from the Free Tier subscription of Oracle Cloud.

I had no problems with box86, but when I tried `cmake .. -DRPI4ARM64=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` with box64, I got this error from cmake:

```
-- Found Python3: /usr/bin/python3.10 (found version "3.10.4") found components: Interpreter
-- The C compiler identification is unknown

CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/CMakeTestCCompiler.cmake:69 (message):
  The C compiler

    "/usr/bin/cc"

  is not able to compile a simple test program.

  It fails with the following output:

If others are able to run it in the oracle cloud using the free and their aarch64, why am I not? Is that a bug or am I just stupid?
