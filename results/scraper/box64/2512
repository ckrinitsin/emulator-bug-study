Application launches, is unusable due to fonts not being displayed/input not working
Thanks for the work on box64.
I have manually compiled box64 for Snapdragon and am using a [prebuilt wine](https://github.com/Kron4ek/Wine-Builds/releases/tag/10.5). I am trying to run [the bazaar](https://playthebazaar.com/). The installer ran fine. The application  launches, but it seems that no text is able to be displayed: the login menu and text fields  are all empty (images work fine). Entering text into the login menu also seems to be broken: the application logs that the password/email field is empty when attempting to log in. Attached is the full log file.

Thanks!
