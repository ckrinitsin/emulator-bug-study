[questions] if Proton is supported does it mean I can launch games that are on SteamOS?
I don't know why I need it  but I was able to build it on ARM64 Ubuntu in virtual machine on M2Pro Probably because it will be necessary to run Steam, however box86 is not able to compile.
Is there any reason to build it natively on Apple Silicon while we have Rosetta?
