SSE4.2 support
Thanks for the great work with box64! Is there any estimated timeline on when we might see support for SSE4.2?

I see you responded here https://boilingsteam.com/box64-witness-the-birth-of-the-arm-gaming-scene/ about a year ago:
> The emulated x86_64 CPU has all the minimum expected extensions: FPU/MMX/SSE/SSE2. Also SSSE3. I started a few SSE4.x opcodes, but it is not fully supported yet.

Is that still in progress?
