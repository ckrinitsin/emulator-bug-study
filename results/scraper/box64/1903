Discussion on the feasibility of the project
I would like to ask a question about the feasibility of the project. I've been following this project for quite a while (about 4 years), sometimes going back to check on changes. And I'm honestly disappointed with the result. I don't want to offend the author or those who support this project, but definitely need to change the approach, as adding manual support for each individual application is just ridiculous. A more universal solution is needed. I would like to hear the author's opinion and find out where I am wrong.

(I believe that such solutions, shown in the screenshot, just slow down the project and must be removed or changed)
