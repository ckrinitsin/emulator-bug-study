Steam on Raspberry Pi 5 with Raspberry Pi OS
I've been unsuccessful in actually running steam on the desktop of a Pi5.  Ive ran the install script but when I run steam its as if I never ran the install script.  I even went through and manually made sure all the associated packages were installed, but nothing.

Apologies for the screenshot but at the moment Im remote.
