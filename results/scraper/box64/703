Enter the Gungeon 64 bits crashes on strcmp
Hi,
So one game I fully expected running well was Enter The Gungeon as it was made to run on box86 according to the compatibility list. Unfortunately it crashes at execution. I've run other Unity games such as Tricky Towers without problem so it seems weird.

Tried running it on box86 but I've got no luck so far running 32 bit mono apps on aarch64 with box86. Unfortunately I think it comes down to being unable to install the armhf equivalent of mono-complete or at the very least mono-runtime or mono-devel leading to usually "corrupt stacktrace" or similar issues. 

Here is the box64 log of execution with rolling log. Tell me if you need any other log.

(crashes with a segmentation fault at the end)

Should I open a box86 issue for the inability to run mono apps on aarch64 or is it a completely unavoidable problem ?
