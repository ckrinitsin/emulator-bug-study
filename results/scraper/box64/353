7 Days To Die dedicated server gets corrupted after few minutes of playing. [Not enough Hotpage...]
Hey! Amateur here trying to get 7 Days To Die dedicated server work on the Oracle Cloud Free Tier, but after a while it becomes unresponsive.
I've compiled box64 inside custom docker image so I can run the server on pterodactyl. Works great, but then server hangs like crazy and game becomes unplayable.  

Here is the trace log [https://pastebin.com/MPc7m73J](https://pastebin.com/MPc7m73J) hopefully someone finds it useful. ðŸ˜‹

_Great software BTW! Loving it so far._
