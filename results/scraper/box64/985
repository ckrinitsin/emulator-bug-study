[32 BIT] Issues with GTA IV and Max Payne 3 when using the dynarec and Wine with WoW64
I have tested Grand Theft Auto IV and Max Payne 3 (both are 32 bit games) on my Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX using Wine 8.16 staging (from Kron4ek) with WoW64 enabled.
When running both games with the dynamic recompiler of box64 enabled, there are issues which make both games unplayable. 
Grand Theft Auto IV gets stuck at the disclaimer screen and doesn't progress any further.
Max Payne 3 gets to the main menu but progressing any further is impossible, since either the menu buttons are invisible or the entire menu screen just appears black while the game doesn't react to any keyboard or mouse input. Furthermore, there are also some audio glitches causing random garbled sound output or loud beeping noises.
When using BOX64_DYNAREC=0 to disable the dynarec, both games work as expected and get ingame without any issues, although performance levels are extremely low due to the much slower interpreter.
I have attached some screenshots below to show what it looks like.
