Java / JVM Support
There are multiple issues open regarding Java support: #112, #71, #193

I just experienced the same issue with another Java GTK app and found them searching the logs. The problem seems to be related to this part of the log always:

```
Error: Global Symbol collector_func_load not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT @0x7fa35040a8 ((nil)) in jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so
Warning: Weak Symbol collector_func_load not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT @0x7fa3504908 (0x22068e)
```

Is it planned to support Java applications at a later time?

I tried to use it to emulate x86/x64 apps on my Ubuntu ARM VM on Apple M1. That might be an interesting use case for other apps too, because qemu is very slow and box might be a lot faster.
