bizhawk cant load roms
Using snapdragon 845 build because I'm using android with Ubuntu on vnc.

i tried running bizhawk on box64 and got this far:

ubuntu@localhost:~$ box64 '/home/ubuntu/Downloads/BizHawk_devbuild_b1e8d93f/EmuHawkMono.sh' 
Dynarec for ARM64, with extension: ASIMD AES CRC32 PMULL ATOMICS PageSize:4096 Cores:8
Params database has 15 entries
Box64 with Dynarec v0.2.1 87b66b8d built on Feb  2 2023 14:42:47
Using default BOX64_LD_LIBRARY_PATH: ./:lib/:lib64/:x86_64/:bin64/:libs64/

Looking for /home/ubuntu/Downloads/BizHawk_devbuild_b1e8d93f/EmuHawkMono.sh
Not an ELF file (sign=#!/b)
Error: reading elf header of /home/ubuntu/Downloads/BizHawk_devbuild_b1e8d93f/EmuHawkMono.sh, try to launch natively instead

depencies needed to run bizhawk: libc6-dev libopenal1 mono-complete

program opens up fine, its just when you load a rom, the program opens an error message saying core accepted the rom but threw an exception.

i think it might be because box64 doesnt load .so files?
