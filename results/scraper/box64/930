About unity game on l4t-ubuntu 18.04
OS: L4T Ubuntu 18.04
Device: Nintendo Switch (switchroot)

I am unable to run any unity64 games with the latest version box64.I always get this message “please enable coredumps (ulimit -c unlimited) and restar” 

I need to switch to the old version three months ago to enter the game.(It shouldn't have been that long)

I don't know if anyone else has this problem.
