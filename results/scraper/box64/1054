Resident Evil 2 remake R.P.C demo crashes on loading screen
The game works normally up until the loading screen then it crashes abruptly.

I tried to get a log but nothing important gets printed on it. I tried to check with BOX64_SHOWSEGV=1 but no sign of segfaulting. Looking at wine side, wine itself end the process after trying to execute an illegal instruction at address 000000003470FB55.

This game can be easily downloaded for free on Steam. It's around 8GB, so it's not even that big.
