aarch64 vs arm64
Hi, I made for pterodactyl a egg that runs a teamspeak 3 server (amd64 only) with the box64 in the docker image installed from the repo.

On my raspberry pi 4 B 4GB it works fine what. The host runs debian 11 and kernel version  5.15.

Now someone tryed to run it on oracle cloud and `uname -a` sas: (Linux vpn 5.15.0-1003-oracle #5-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 20 04:51:36 UTC 2022 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux) on Ubuntu 22.04 and he gets `cannot execute binary file: Exec format error`

How can I fix this?
