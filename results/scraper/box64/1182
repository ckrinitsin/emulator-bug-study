Valheim Dedicated Server Crashes Post Unity 2022 Update
Hello there,

I had been running Valheim dedicated server on Ampere arm based server, using the below install script:
https://gist.github.com/husjon/c5225997eb9798d38db9f2fca98891ef
This was working for quite some time.
However, as of a November 7th update of the server and clients to Unity 2022, the server will disconnect clients and then crash about 20 seconds after a client connects. I can confirm I am pulling and compiling a fairly recent version of box64:

    box64 --version
    Dynarec for ARM64, with extension: ASIMD AES CRC32 PMULL ATOMICS PageSize:4096 Running on Neoverse-N1 with 4 Cores
    Params database has 30 entries
    Box64 with Dynarec v0.2.5 2a4fe803 built on Dec 24 2023 07:41:33

Finally, I would like to submit logs, but the logfiles generated are over 350 MB in size. How would I submit them here?

I am generating these logs via
    BOX64_LOG=2 BOX64_TRACE_FILE=valheim_arm_crash.txt /home/ubuntu/valheim_server/valheim_server.x86_64 -nographics - batchmode -port 2456  -public 1 -name serverName -password sometemporarydummypassword -savedir /home/ubuntu/valheim_data
    
Thank you for your time and for this awesome project.
