Error loading needed lib libxshmfence.so.1
So I just compiled and installed Box64 on my 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS [bullseye] install

I try to install Joplin - a cloud note-taking app that is critical for my usage case, from the AppImage and I get this:
```

AppImages require FUSE to run. 
You might still be able to extract the contents of this AppImage 
if you run it with the --appimage-extract option. 
See https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE 
for more information
```

Ok, no biggie, I extract the appimage as suggested, and get this when trying to run ./AppRun:
```

To confirm, libxshfence.so and it's dev files are installed on this system.  Is there a way to force Box64 to use it?  Do I need to recompile with some esoteric option?  As I said, this app is critical to my usage case and sadly the dev refuses to support it on ARM so any help at all would be extremely welcome.
