Steamwebhelper is not responding
Hello, This is.. probably the billion-th time this error has occured and i am no longer able to workaround it so about time i made this issue.

Ever since steam started becoming more of a web based application it became increasingly dificult to get it running on ArchLinux ARM/based distros.
I have been able to run steam "perfectly fine" on my ARM devices running arch/armtix however as of late (Unsure which version of box86/box64 broke this) i am unable to launch steam.

I keep getting "Steamwebhelper is not responding" which i have previously used to just workaround by using older steam versions, alas that is also broken now.

For context i launch steam like so:
```
export LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=/usr/lib/dri:/usr/lib32/dri

export STEAMOS=1
export STEAM_RUNTIME=1
export DBUS_FATAL_WARNINGS=0
/usr/lib/steam/bin_steam.sh
```
Tested on rk3588 (Orange pi 5 plus) and sdm845 (OnePlus 6T)
Both of which are running Armtix linux and are on linux 6.11
