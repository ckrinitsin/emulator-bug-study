Running Blue Revolver on VF2 leads to OOM
Reproduce:

1. Download `[experimental] bluerevolver_v051_demo_linux.tar.gz` from https://woofycakes.itch.io/blue-revolver-v05
2. Uncompress it and run `box64 bin/love64 bin/game.love` (with gl4es and emulated SDL)

The game seems running fine, but memory usage will grow at a rate of 1GB/s until it gets killed. I already tried `BOX64_DYNAREC=0`, no help.

@xctan has run it on a native machine, and the memory usage is normal.
