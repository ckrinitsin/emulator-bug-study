Busy-wait issue....?
FIrst of all thank you for Box64 and all the docs, I had very little trouble getting PalServer for Windows running on ARM64 :)

One question though, I noticed that the CPU usage is always maxed out - but not really, just as reported by the Linux OS. Is this possibly because of a busy-wait somewhere or something more technical?

Not a huge deal, I cap the CPU usage on the host anyway now that I've docker-ized it but it'd be nice to see the real CPU usage of the process :)

NB: FEX Emu does not have the same issue, though Box64 is faster - if having an unreliable CPU measurement on my control panel is the cost of that then so be it.

Thanks again!
