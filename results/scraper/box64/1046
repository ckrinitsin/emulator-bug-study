Satisfactory Dedicated Server
Hello, I'm trying to run a Satisfactory Dedicated Server in an arm64 VM running in the cloud. Using Box86 for the steamcmd and Box64 for the dedicated server.

When starting the server, Box64 kicks in, a lot of 'Using emulated ...' logs get printed, but at one point it always halts and nothing happens anymore. The process fully blocks the cpu core.

The terminal output:
