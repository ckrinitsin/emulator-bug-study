steamclient.so error while trying to init ARK Dedicated Server
Hello, people! I tried to run ARK Dedicated Server on Box64 at leatest version, but I get a `steamclient.so` error. When I try to start the ARK Dedicated server, i recive this error:
```

I search for closed issues, but didn't find anything like this. I really don't know how to fix it. How can I get rid of this error?
