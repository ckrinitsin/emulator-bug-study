Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition still unplayable on Snapdragon 8 gen 2 or above phones 
Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition is still unplayable on latest devices like Snapdragon 8 gen 2 or above chipset. This game is certainly playable on lower end Snapdragon devices but has low fps. On newer devices, the game will just tells you **"(s)Network::init Error"**

The game is playable on newer device only if you root your phone and also with a use of Termux. Its a hassle to do all of these just to play one game and I wanted to ask if there will be a box64 that will solve the GFWL issue on Resident Evil 5?
