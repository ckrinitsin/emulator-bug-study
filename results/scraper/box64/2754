Bizhawk waterbox cores don't open on winlator.
Using https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator

And using bizhawk 2.9.1 as that's the most stable.

Logs aren't really showing anything of use.. at best some "fixme" messages from wine...

Using wine 10

Waterbox cores are ds, ps1, Saturn, among others. Just for tool assisted speedrunning.

https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/tree/master/waterbox that's the source for waterbox. 

Been trying to get this fixed for a while now..
