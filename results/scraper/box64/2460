Missing symbols when running electron app
When I go to run an x86_64 election app (closed source and not public yet, I might be able to get a test build to you if you need it, let me know) it fails to run with the following errors:

```
Error: Symbol gdk_pixbuf_new_from_bytes not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT
Error: Symbol gdk_pixbuf_calculate_rowstride not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT
```

Let me know if you need any more info!
