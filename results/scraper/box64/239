Linker error while attempting to build
Hello! So I tried to build Box64 and everything went well until it started to link the program. It gave this error:
```
CMakeFiles/box64.dir/src/tools/my_cpuid.c.o: In function `my_cpuid':
/home/charlie/box64/src/tools/my_cpuid.c:49: undefined reference to `getcpu'
```

Here's the log of the terminal just in case:
[install-fail-Box64.txt](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/8104916/install-fail-Box64.txt)
