Issue with x86-64 application launch
Hello,
when launching x86-64 apllication I've got  strange message and application failed
3313|0x40d8f0: Unimplemented Opcode (C3) 66 0F 38 30 D0 66 0F 73 D8 08 66 0F 38 30 C0

Is there something not implemented on box64
The application used is sbf2rin (application for gnss purpose)

The version of box64 used is the following :
box64 -v
Dynarec for ARM64, with extension: ASIMD CRC32 PageSize:4096
Box64 with Dynarec v0.1.7 23bbab1 built on Mar  2 2022 10:58:22

Thanks for your help
