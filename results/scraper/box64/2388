The Sims 3 don't work
Hello, heres
History of my researches:

from this https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/actions/runs/12137984912  commit game just cant start anymore, before this game opens and loads perfectly


https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/actions/runs/12471518553
from this commit (although its failed for some builds) game starts again but cant pass first loading screen and game crashes on desktop, by the way, this behavior has happened before, the game never pass first loading screen until Box64 0.3.1 (tested on Aug 29 2024  build).

* Android builds.
* So, from commit 794f210 to 6fac9ee something fixed and something broke along the way.
