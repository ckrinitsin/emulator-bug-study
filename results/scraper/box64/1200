SteamApi_Init() fails on latest version
i had a box64 version from +- December 12, just updated to latest one and it seems that steamapi in unreal engine games is no more working (it was working fine just before the update) ![Screenshot_2024-01-12-20-54-22-823_com termux x11](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/assets/71220271/f3392acf-145f-4124-b314-696cc7831d97)
the log after dxvk initialization is only those 2 lines:
```
shared memfd open() failed: Invalid argument
