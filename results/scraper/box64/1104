Help, please
Hello, I want to compile box64.86 for non-standard paths, how can I specify the location of the future Box64.86 binary file and the path to the libraries? for example "/xxxx/yyyy/bin/Box86" ,   "/xxxx/yyyy/lib86". (I'm compiling in Ubuntu-Termux, I want to compile under a different prefix)
