A compilation problem
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm in great trouble. 
Now I'm trying to compile this program. The cmake construction has been completed normally, but an error about the assembly file occurred during make compilation. I'm a little here.

```
/home/greatwall/ww/gitee/box64/src/dynarec/arm64_prolog.S: Assembler messages:
/home/greatwall/ww/gitee/box64/src/dynarec/arm64_prolog.S:12: error：operand 1 should be a floating-point register -- `stp lr,fp,[sp,-16]'
CMakeFiles/dynarec_arm.dir/build.make:158: recipe for target 'CMakeFiles/dynarec_arm.dir/src/dynarec/arm64_prolog.S.o' failed
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/dynarec_arm.dir/src/dynarec/arm64_prolog.S.o] Error 1
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:288: recipe for target 'CMakeFiles/dynarec_arm.dir/all' failed
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/dynarec_arm.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:160: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
```

For the construction process, please refer to the description in the document and use it as follows:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DARM_DYNAREC=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
```

and My machine CPU info is :  

```

It's very urgent to get your help. Thank you very much.    :)
