 Versions DVXK: The manufacturer changes slightly on 1.10.3 the map area is fully visible on 2.6.1 the map textures become black render on the fly that's all I noticed during testing 
Device: xiaomi pad 6s pro
Wine 9.2 
Version Mesa: 25.1.0 
Does changing the box affect performance or is it just an error?
