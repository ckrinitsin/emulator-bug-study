Run Appimages
Maybe just a fever dream but then so is box64 :)
Is there anyway to run an x86_64 appimage?  when I try to run Musescore's app image

https://musescore.org/en/download

I get the standard
cannot execute binary file: Exec format error

I assume it has something to do with AppImage's contained nature not being picked up by box64
