[box32] Steam fails due to a pointer not being 32-bit
I'm unable to launch Steam with Box32 after running `install_steam.sh` and then launching Steam. This is with the latest build of Box64 on a X Elite laptop with Ubuntu 24.10.

Error:

```
[BOX32] Warning, pointer 0xffff8a67b008 is not a 32bits value
/home/user/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh: line 949:  5211 Aborted                 (core dumped) "$STEAMROOT/$STEAMEXEPATH" "$@"
```

Also to note, I've been trying to run the recent required workaround for Steam to delete this file but Steam keeps downloading, extracting, and seemingly using it. That might explain part of the issue here.

```
$ rm -f ~/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/crashhandler.so
```
