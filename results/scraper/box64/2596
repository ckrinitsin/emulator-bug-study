Battle Brothers on box32
Hi @ptitSeb,
I'm opening this issue because I believe you might be my last hope to get this game running decently on my smartphone.

Device specifications: OnePlus 12R - SD8Gen2 - 16GB RAM - Android 15 (OxygenOS)
Videogame: Battle Brothers, a 2D OpenGL 3.3 32-bit game

Problem: Severe frame rate fluctuations; FPS on the world map vary between 10 and 40, and in battles between 15 and 50, making the game playable but with a noticeably poor experience.

Apps through which I used Box64/Box32:

Winlator Official by brunodev85 (latest build - Winlator 10 Final (hotfix))

Winlator Box32 Mod by alexvorxx (https://github.com/alexvorxx/winlator/releases/tag/v7.1.5-mod3)

With Winlator Official, I tried running the game with Box64 and WOW64. I kept the default "Intermediate" settings, only changing the parameter BOX64_DYNAREC_FORWARD to 1024. I did this because leaving it at 128 made the game run with such low FPS that it was practically unplayable. As the graphic driver, I initially used Turnip and the DXVK wrapper. I also tried all other combinations, but even when the game managed to start (not all configurations did), the issue persisted.

With Winlator Box32 Mod, I obviously used the only configuration that allows Box32: Turnip and WineD3D as the DX wrapper. In this specific case, besides the aforementioned BOX64_DYNAREC_FORWARD, I also modified other variables:

BOX64_DYNAREC_BIGBLOCK set to 3

BOX64_DYNAREC_WAIT set to 0

BOX64_RESERVE_HIGH set to 1

With this latter setup, I got about 5 or 6 more FPS compared to the one achieved with Winlator Official. So, it's likely that Box32 emulates this game better than Box64. However, the FPS instability issue persists: it's as if during certain screen transitions or specific moments, FPS drops sharply for several seconds.

I'm attaching all the logs I was able to produce with Winlator Box32 Mod, hoping you might give me some guidance or find them useful in case there’s something that needs fixing.

Looking forward to your feedback, and I want to sincerely thank you for everything you do. If needed, I’m available for any kind of testing. I truly hope to get Battle Brothers running decently because it's a fantastic game that fits the mobile context extremely well.
