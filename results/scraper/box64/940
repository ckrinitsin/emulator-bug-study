cmakelist.txt need an update
I got this:
``` shell
CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.
```
So change this:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4) to
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4...3.5)
