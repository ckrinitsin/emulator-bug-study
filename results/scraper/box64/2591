`cannot execute binary file: Exec format error` AFTER Steam successfully downloads and installs itself
I built and installed Box64 with Box32 enabled, and then ran the `install_steam.sh` script. Afterwards, I ran `box64 steam` and the Steam download window opened, it downloaded an extracted itself, and then began starting. Afterwards it got stuck in a loop where it would repeatedly try to start various Steam executables with the error `cannot execute binary file: Exec format error`, despite the Steam setup process working just fine with no such error.

I `rm -rf`ed ~/steam and ~/.local/share/Steam and re-ran the whole process, this time outputting to a text file, and that file is attached below:
