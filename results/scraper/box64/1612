"steamwebhelper requires the Sniper steam runtime" when installing Steam
Hello there,

I am getting the following popup when installing steam on a fresh install of Kubuntu 24.04 on a Nintendo Switch:
```
steamwebhelper requires the Sniper steam runtime.

Not found at /home/disturbo/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_64/steam-runtime-sniper, there is a problem with your installation, aborting.
```

I restarted the machine after installing both Box64 and Steam.

The log file for the webhelper (`/home/disturbo/.local/share/Steam/logs/webhelper-linux.txt`):
```
