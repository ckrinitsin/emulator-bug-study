Running bedrock_server (Minecraft Private Server App) on Ubuntu Arm with Box64 - got some bugs inside server
(for reference, I'm opening a replica here, because I've mistaken and created it on box86 repo, [original link](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86/issues/595))

So, for the Op Code you said, it seems to be ok now! But the skin issue is the same, just to point it.
