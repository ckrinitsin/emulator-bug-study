Valheim - missing symbol
Hello,

I'm using a Raspberry Pi 4 and Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS to run a Valheim server.

I recently upgraded the server and got these errors:
Using environment steamid 892970
Using steam APPID:892970
Using emulated ./linux64/steamclient.so
Error: Symbol __dprintf_chk not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT @0x1087255f0 (0x3191f6) in ./linux64/steamclient.so

Error: relocating Plt symbols in elf steamclient.so
Error initializing needed lib steamclient.so
Warning: Cannot dlopen("steamclient.so"/0x10352cec5, 2)

Can you help me to solve these errors?

Thank you
