[box64] Red Dead Redemption II 'Unable to launch game'
After updating box64 and box86 to the latest versions (`box64-generic-arm 0.3.3+20250120T062614.e6eac93-1` for box64), I tried to launch Red Dead Redemption II, but received the following error message once it launched:

It reads:

> Unable to launch game, please try reinstalling the game.

Here are the console logs during the game launch, from the moment I clicked 'Play' in steam's UI to the point after I clicked OK to dismiss the error message.
