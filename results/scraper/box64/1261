SteamVR OpenXR vulkan failed to find VkPhysicalDevice matching deviceUUID
I've been able to run SteamVR successfully (tracking works fine and I get the default steamvr aurora skybox in the headset), but I'm unable to get any applications to actually submit frames successfully.

`hello_xr` with the vulkan backend somewhat gracefully exits.

From the SteamVR xrclient log:
```
Sun Feb 11 2024 16:51:52.364802 [Info] - IVRSystem::GetOutputDevice: failed to find VkPhysicalDevice matching deviceUUID
Sun Feb 11 2024 16:51:52.364994 [Error] - CSxrCompositorOpenVRGetVulkanGRaphicsDevice error: failed to determine output device
```

The only three vulkan calls I found with `BOX64_LOG=2` after a lot of `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` calls were to calls to`vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices` and then `8785|0x3f030d9fcc: Calling vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2(0x55E186D0, 0x7FA4484720, 0x7FA44846B0, ...) => return 0x105C0` , directly after which the error message gets created and written to the log.

`hellovr_vulkan` looses its connection to the X server and then shuts down. This could also be down to library issues however, I'll have to see if I can get it to recompile in an environment with older libraries (especially an older libc).
`3975|0x100045375: Calling SDL_CreateWindow(0x100062B09, 0x2BC, 0x64, ...) =>X connection to :0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).`

OpenVR through wine64 produces some more interesting errors in the vrclient log

```
in this case, the application runs and tracks correctly, but no frames get submitted to SteamVR (or at least they aren't visible in the headset, it's still showing the default skybox)

I didn't see any errors about missing vulkan extensions, so that's likely not the issue. Monado is also able to run fine fully in box64.  
I haven't been able to run SteamVR with `BOX64_log=2` yet unfortunately.
