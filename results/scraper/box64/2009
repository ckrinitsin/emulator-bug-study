Performance regression in many games
I recently noticed that since commit [3448e94] (Improve handling of memory protection and execution bit), there’s been a noticeable performance regression across many of the games I've tried. In some games, the issue is more noticeable, while in others it’s less so.

For example, in Fable: The Lost Chapters, the frame rate dropped from around ~55FPS to ~35FPS, or in Sonic Lost World, it went from ~45FPS to ~40FPS.

I'm using an Nvidia Tegra X1+ device, and this issue started occurring after compiling that particular commit.
