Unexpected Behaviors when Using RISC-V Extension "zbs"
### Description & Investigation

I tried to run python3.12 on box64, and it crashed with SIGSEGV. Using `BOX64_DYNAREC_TEST=1`, I saw many differences about RIP:

```txt
Warning, difference between x64 Interpreter and Dynarec in 0x3f001e44b1 (0f 82 82 03 00 00 8d b0)
=======================================
DIFF: Dynarec |  Interpreter
----------------------
RIP: 0000003f001e44b7 | 0000003f001e4839
Warning, difference between x64 Interpreter and Dynarec in 0x3f001e4405 (0f 82 2d 01 00 00 83 ea)
=======================================

----------------------
RIP: 0000003f001e440b | 0000003f001e4538

DIFF: Dynarec |  Interpreter
(( omitted ))
```

These addresses are all in `libpython3.12.so` and `objdump` told me **they all almost look like**:

```asm
bt     %eax,%ecx
jb     (( somewhere ))
```

The `bt` instruction should set the CF flag and the behavior of the following `jb` instruction depends on it. So I read current code:

https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/d6b9fd2860dc097de8aebf147b3aa6d1741ea550/src/dynarec/rv64/dynarec_rv64_0f.c#L1720-L1739

and saw `BEXT` will emit to `bext` instruction when "zbs" extension enabled.

When turning off the "zbs" extension, `libpython3.12` still crashed but the test log showed other differences irrelative with `bt` instruction:

```txt
(( BEGIN ))

(( END ))
```

Again, `objdump` told me **they all look like**:

```asm
cmp    (( %esi or $0x63 here )),%eax
jle/jg    (( somewhere ))
```

Maybe at least we can say the `bt` instruction with "zbs" extension results in the my first "dynarec test" difference of this issue. And the latter one is still in investigation.
