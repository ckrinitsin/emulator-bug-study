an error window like so pops up 
![20240228_23h10m58s_grim](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/assets/28281419/5e41b617-a8ed-4b56-bb2d-6b06a382eb7e)
none of the options change anything in getting steam to launch.

this has been replicated on multiple systems with a fresh steam install:
Ubuntu Bionic Nintendo Switch
Ubuntu Jammy Nintendo Switch
Debian Bookworm RPi5

(info for the discord users, not ptitSeb: I have requested that users create a bug report for such issues that occur on Box64 but not on a standard x86_64 PC. Over the past few days there have been a dozen or so reports in the discord servers but nobody has followed the advise and created a bug report. All of the users reading this where I requested that you open a bug report force me to make it instead of reading and following directions)
