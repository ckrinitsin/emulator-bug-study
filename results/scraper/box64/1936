Fallout New Vegas Box64
Hi, I have a question and a request, the situation is as follows: FNV works without crashes only with STRONGMEM=1, with 0 it crashes after a couple of minutes, but the thing is that with 1 , fps drops a lot (from about 60 to 35-40, which is a lot), the only way out is to use Box64 from January 23 (wow64 support) and until about February 10 or so, on these versions when STRONGMEM= 1 fps drops only from 60 to 50 and the game does not crash, is it possible to make it so that it would be possible to play without STRONGMEM? Fallout 3 uses the same engine, and it runs without STRONGMEM without crashes.. please note, thanks in advance

I use arm64 android builds
