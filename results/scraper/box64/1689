How to Count the Number of Executions of Each Dynablock in Box64?
Hello,
I would like to contribute to Box64 project and would like to count the number of executions of each **dynablock**. Is there an existing method to achieve this? Alternatively, is it possible to add some logging in the code to track the execution count?
Thank you for your help!
