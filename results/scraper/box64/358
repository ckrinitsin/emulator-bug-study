Non Vanilla M1 (m1max) Getting the Pagefile size error
Hi thanks for you work on box64.

Was trying to follow along on your instructions for running box64 (world of goo) on an asahi setup on my m1-max cpu.

When running anything I get the following error:
`Error: PageSize configuation is wrong: configured with 4096, but got 16384`
