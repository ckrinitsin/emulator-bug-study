[Regression] Can't connect to TS3-Server on RaspberryPI 3B anymore with box64 v0.1.8
## Description ##
With v0.1.8 there seems to be a regression with box64, which doesn't allow me to connect to my TS3-Server anymore. The Server starts as it should (doesn't crash) but it's not possible to connect to it.

I've opened a detailed post on the raspberrypi-forums first (https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=334324), that suggested I should try with v0.1.6 of box64, which fixed the problem.

If you need further information, let me know. Hopefully this can be fixed in later revisions :)

## System Details ##
Hardware: Raspberry PI 3B
OS: RaspberryPI OS Lite (64-bit), installed using RPI Imager Tool
TS3-Server: Latest from website (v3.13.6, Linux x64), https://teamspeak.com/en/downloads/#server
