Android compilation
Hello, sorry. I'm currently looking through the docs and haven't found how to manually compile a box64 for Android.
Maybe I haven't found it yet, so I'd like to ask you. If I were to compile, on this side, I'm using the cross-compilation toolchain on the virtual machine Ubuntu. Could you recommend which toolchain I should use for the compilation? Thank you! Because I also want to do the compilation manually and enjoy the process.
