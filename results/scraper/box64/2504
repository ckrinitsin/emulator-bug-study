Psychonauts 1 missing voice overs
This is using latest GOG version of the game and latest box64 - game audio works fine but in-game voice overs of characters are missing.

Reproducible every time no matter the settings of the game.

Tried to change settings in AudioSettings.ini; compatibility; audio devices; restarting the game; different wine etc. Issue still persists.
