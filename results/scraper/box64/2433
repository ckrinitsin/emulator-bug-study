AC Origins crashes randomly
Hi

Device: Poco F6 (Adreno 735)
Winlator: glibc 7.1.5 and official
Android: 15
Wine versions: 9.16 – 9.21, 9.2
Box64: 0.3.3 

Congratulations on the Box64 0.3.4 release. Hope you all success.

Assassin's Creed Origins crashes randomly,sometimes in the main menu, other times in game.

I Tried Changing Box64 settings, Turnip, DXVK, and Wine versions but nothing helped.

I tried with `BOX64_LOG=1` `WINEDEBUG=+seh,+tid,+pagefault`

 Log at crash

> [21:54:33]  wine: Unhandled page fault on read access to  at address 000000014089AD1A (thread 0108), starting debugger...

Log

[winlator-logs.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19170319/winlator-logs.txt)

And with 
`BOX64_TRACE=1` Game didn’t crash, but The character froze in place and couldn’t move, but the game remained responsive (I could move the camera and access settings).

Log trace file grew to 350MB, repeating the same line,i checked multiple times it's all the exact same line:

> 28293 Strange SIGSEGV with Access error on 0x778d8ca6c8 for 0x8372ffe8 mapped
db=0x778e05ddc0, prot=0x3 (old_addr=0x8372ffe8, Lock=0x0)

and at the end of the log:

> Sigfault/Segbus while quitting, exit

I don't know if it's Box64 issue or not,sorry for bothering you.

Thanks.
