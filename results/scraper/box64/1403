Gnome-console-46.0 Breaks Box64
### Issue
When testing two games `Axiom Verge` and `Axiom Verge 2` with Goldberg, I found the strange issue, that gnome-console-46.0 breaks known working Box64 games.

My current workaound is using xterm or add `export TERM=xterm` to start script.

Good log with xterm and error log via gnome-console are listed at bottom.

These two games are known as good. And I never seen the below "Unhandled Exception" before.
I reverted box64 to release version, https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/e42001b2bc030f93bdba582bf12d6eac63fae345 and https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/45c4117a40e564b84dc8659283b52d92defe86c0 and the above issue remains.
So it's not recent non-4k commits to blame.

Then I saw `System.Console` in the log. 
So I added `export TERM=xterm` to the start scripts, and the two games launched!
Or launching the two games in xterm also worked.

I am almost sure that when I was at Gnome 45, I didn't see such an issue.
