Very notable performance due to Build and Release Box64 #4772: Commit 5bde45c  (Winlator)
When 0.3.2 was released I tried it and I noticed an big performance regression on winlator (android).

I tried diffefent 'box64-latest.wcp' builds from the actions tab to identify which build was the one that introduced the regression till I found it:

From [this build](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/actions/runs/12137674194) (related to commit https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/5bde45cc8695e85de56dc11ecc391bfb2b74bb38) the performance regression in some games is massive. As it can be seen in the video the FPS drop like crazy going down to even 13fps only: https://streamable.com/h9qfy7

With the build 4771 from the same actions tab (and previous builds) it's quitte stable and the FPS can vary from 27 to 32 in the same area but it's not as bad as it's on #4772 and next ones.

I'm hoping the performance regression can be reversed so we, winlator users, can enjoy the other improvements and fixed that I suppose were added to 0.3.2
