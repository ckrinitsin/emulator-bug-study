[DXVK-Patched wine] cannot allocate memory
OS: Ubuntu 24.10
Device: Raspberry pi 4B (8GB)
Software: Honkers railway launcher (x86 program recompiled for ARM64)
attempting to launch HSR with this version of wine causes a bunch of "cannot allocate memory" errors at the same address, followed by a stack overflow
no clue why this happens since every other app launched by this wine binary runs completely fine
