Newest git version unuseable - high cpu usage on RPI 5 ARM64
Hi,

I have a surprisingly big performance issue with latest git versions. I cannot pinpoint which ones, but I'm working everyday on 0.2.6, and I started having the issue compiling newer git version by the end of January.

My report is with today's git version.

Problem: 
- Using Box64 version 0.2.6 is normal. For example, dwarf fortress 0.51 loads in 5 seconds. 
- Using the result of the compilation from git (29/02/2024) on the same setup is very very slow. Processor runs at 70% and the game takes 30s- 1m to launch. After that the game is still slow. Anything is 3-4 times slower than normal.
- vulkan games tend to not to load/be too slow for me to wait for them. Art of Rally is buggy on vulkan version with 0.2.6, but does not load ( after 5 minutes) on latest git. Most vulkan version of games have problem on RPI5, but for example, you can launch Fort Triumph on vulkan but not in opengl even if it crashes after a few moves. It does not launch on latest git.

Technical info:
- Rpi5 8 GB
- official Raspberry OS lite, Wayland, fully patched
- Kernel8.img with 4096 Kb pages. Box versions compiled accordingly.

As the program function normally except for the slow behavior, I'm not sure if there is any log I can provide, but I'm ready to test any simple or advanced procedures.

Thanks
