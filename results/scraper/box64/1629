Error: PltResolver: Symbol cupsSetPasswordCB2 trying to wipe a drive with Active KillDisk
As the title says, I'm getting an error when I try to wipe a drive with KillDisk. The second I click on the "Erase Drive" button at the top the program closes. Below is the console output from the crash. Any help or direction would be appreciated.
