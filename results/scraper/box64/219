How to use GTK based gui program
I wanted to use the UniFlash (linux version) program from Ti on my Rasp Pi. However, it seems to use GTK which is not supported (directly, yet) by box64. There is a brief comment about placing GTK libraries to place known by box64. Could this be elaborated upon? Or would it be more possible to use wine and use the windows version?

I can add the error messages if needed. (They are on the pi and I was not singed into GitHub over there)
