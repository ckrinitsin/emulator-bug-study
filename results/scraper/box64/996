The Witcher 3: High memory usage in termux with chroot
I tested The Witcher 3 in termux on SD865 6 gb ram device.
Tested with Wine 8.2 and Wine-GE-Custom 8-14.
Termux proot - game works stable, Wine taskmgr shows 1.8 gb ram usage in-game.
Termux chroot - system freezes when ram is exhausted. In the main menu taskmgr shows 3 gb ram usage.
