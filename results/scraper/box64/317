Segmentation fault?
## On a Raspberry Pi 4B (8GB RAM)
_I installed box64 from the pre-compiled Debian binaries (If it matters)_
So basically, I was following a tutorial on how to run Deltarune on linux.
The binaries I used were made for x64 hardware, so I ran them with box64, but I found this dirty error:
```

The folders are like so:

 - assets (folder included with game)
