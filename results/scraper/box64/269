Failure to create a lib for libprotobuf
When loading a program, I came across the following error:
> Trying to add "libprotobuf.so.14" to maplib
> Trying to load "libprotobuf.so.14"
> Simplified name is "libprotobuf.so.14"
> Faillure to create lib => fail
> Error loading needed lib libprotobuf.so.14
> Error loading one of needed lib

What are the possible reasons for Box64 failing to use an emulated library?
