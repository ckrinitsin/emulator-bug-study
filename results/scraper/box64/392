Factorio Server Failing to Start
I'm using an Oracle Cloud server with ARM64, and I compiled box64 with
$ cmake .. -DARM_DYNAREC=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DPAGE64K=1
When I try to start the server, it just stalls after here.
```
Dynarec for ARM64, with extension: ASIMD AES CRC32 PMULL ATOMICS PageSize:65536
Box64 with Dynarec v0.1.9 ca8ff5f built on Aug 15 2022 21:09:42
Using default BOX64_LD_LIBRARY_PATH: ./:lib/:lib64/:x86_64/:bin64/:libs64/
Using default BOX64_PATH: ./:bin/

Looking for ./factorio
Rename process to "factorio"
Using native(wrapped) libdl.so.2
Using native(wrapped) libc.so.6
Using native(wrapped) ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

```
A simple hello world program works, so I could be missing something.
Here is a log from BOX64_LOG=2. https://hastebin.com/ugucaqopas.yaml
I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing wrong, but hopefully the log helps.
