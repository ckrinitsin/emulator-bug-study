EMUELEC SDL 2.26 and higher Segfault due to controllerguid
Hello 

I'm from the tester community of Emuelec and I'm updating from SDL 2.24.2 to higher versions. I notice that SDL2.26 and onwards crashes box64 due to the new CRC functionality. I tested with a xbox360 wireless pad and with a regular wired xbox 360 pad. The pads appear as generic x-box pad

The SDL2 commit that starts to fail is https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/3cbfd75d0fb00c8816d2a2523a0be0a86757aff3

If the pad is turnes on it works and the gamr is executed.
Platform
-----------------
The platform used is odroid n2+ . BOX64 has been built using Ubuntu 22.04 WSL2 gcc 12.1, cmake 3.27.5 Emuelec Toolchain for amlogic-ng

Log File
----------------
[emuelec.log](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/files/12848399/emuelec.log)

The issue is only happening with Box64 but it seems related to SDL as the call is within the context of the shovel knight game when asking for the pad. 

However I want to check with Box64 community.

ask
----------------
Understand if it's a bug in SDL or maybe is not retriving the controllerdb file from any path or a Box64 bug. I don't know :)

But I'm sure is related to the controllerids before the seg fault.
