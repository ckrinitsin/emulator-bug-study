Steam web views not working
System info:
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 64-bit
Board: Raspberry Pi 4 4GB

I have both Box86 and Box64 installed through Pi-Apps, and installed Steam myself
from Steams official download page. Everything else seems to work, except for any kind of web view.

And in Small mode, I can see the list of games, install them, uninstall them, the works, but if I click "Properties" then nothing
happens, probably because it is also a web view.
