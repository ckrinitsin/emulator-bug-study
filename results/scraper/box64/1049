Source 2 games freeze and crash after boot
tried on wine 8.2 staging and wine ge 8.14. was using latest box64 from the repo, compiled with SAVE_MEM option. i set up steam and then try to run dota 2 (windows version), it loads to menu (only if i skip intro cutscene with -novid flag, otherwise it's crashing on cutscene with the same log) and then after like 5 seconds it crashes (sometimes just freezes). when i look in logs the only thing that appears after i start the game is like this
```
01a8:err:virtual:try_map_free_area mmap() error Cannot allocate memory, range 0x3aa5c0000-0x3aa5d1000, unix_prot 0x1.
```
and it repeats like that for a VERY LOT of times, there's no even a single line with something different from that after the game started. tried to run it with BOX64_DYNAREC_STRONGMEM set to 3 and nothing changed. i can assume that it tries to allocate memory, but can't for some reason and then it leads to something like SIGSEGV. i remember having the same issue in counter strike 2, so maybe it occurs in all games on Source 2.
