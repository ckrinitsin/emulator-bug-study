Raspberry Pi 5 with Raspberry Pi OS may not run steam "steam-runtime-launcher-service crashes"
I tried to run steam with box86 or box64, but both of them failed to run
Here's the log:

I can't even see the login window, but only 'steamwebhelper is not responding' window, i also tried 'Restart Steam with GPU Acceleration disabled' and other opinions ...just not woking, same error outputed
From the log last lines, i found that the problem is steam-runtime-launcher-service crash frequently, due to steamwebhelper crash, you can also check out the error line with Chinese characters, that may also the problem...(anyway, i'm the Chinese)
Anyway, i checked out most of issues about steam, but none of which are same, what interesting
I saw the Raspberry 5 install steam instrution uses Ubuntu, is that steam with box86/box64 just won't work in debian 12 ?
