the some 32bit game error


The games I can run now  Prince of Qin、媚肉の香り(Biniku no Kaori )、biko4、syuu saku、河原崎家の一族2(Kawarazaki-ke no Ichizoku 2)、僕は天使じゃないよ(Boku wa Tenshi Janai yo). 

媚肉の香り(Biniku no Kaori )与biko4 require dxvk to start.


when I am upgrade from [770cba7e2b46d3bbd0ce309dbc253f7a4517087a](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/770cba7e2b46d3bbd0ce309dbc253f7a4517087a) to [910420af0780fa468a58ba42c2ee4f030697a607](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/commit/910420af0780fa468a58ba42c2ee4f030697a607)

Some games may display:  (0024:err:winediag:MIDIMAP_drvOpen No software synthesizer midi port found, Midi sound output probably won't work.)
Some games do not have this prompt, but the sound is not always normal.

In addition, the game I ran with the dxvk had graphic errors. I seek advice from @theofficialgman , who said it should be Nvidia's own 32.7 driver issue. I don't know if other devices running dxvk will have these issues.

More games will require more 32 bit opcodes like Warcraft 3.

7631|0x2113d02b: Unimplemented 32bits Opcode (53 56 57 1E) 06 B8 00 00 00 00 07 1F 5F 5E 5B C3 53 56 57 Sigfault/Segbus while quitting, exiting silently.

Thank you for your box64, which has enabled us to achieve many possibilities.
