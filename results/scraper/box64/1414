### Description
<!-- Provide a simple description of what happens during the emulation. -->
Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived v1.1.9.a1704342 (39945), Linux x64, GOG, Engine: 

Box64 with Dynarec v0.2.7 4a889e3
Rock 5B, LFS, Kernel rk-6.1-rkr1-panthor-v6, Mesa 24.1.0, Gnome 46

- Not working. Can't launch the game.
- Tried combination of the following,
```bash
export PAN_MESA_DEBUG=gl3
export LC_ALL=C
export TERM=xterm
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/box-libs/aarch64/:/opt/box-libs/x86_64/:./lib64
# export BOX64_DYNAREC_FASTROUND=0
export BOX64_DYNAREC_STRONGMEM=1
export BOX64_PREFER_EMULATED=1
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 box64 ./"Interrogation.x86_64"
# box64 ./"Interrogation.x86_64"
```
- Is it `libasound` to blame?
