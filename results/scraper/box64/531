### Description
<!-- Provide a simple description of what happens during the emulation. -->
Stardew Valley v1.5.6.1988831614 (53040) GOG version not working.

- Old version such as 1.5.4 GOG which contains Stardew Valley.exe can use the mono trick and `ln -s libopenal.so libsoft_oal.so` and working
- The latest version as 1.5.6 doesn't have .exe file, so I can not use the mono trick.
- Already tested using debian x86_64 libs for missing libs with LD trick

### Tested on
<!-- Machine on which it's has been tested on (like RPi4, OpenPandora, Odroid XU4...) -->
RADXA Rock 5B (rk3588) 16GB
LFS, BSP kernel 5.10.110+, Gnome 43.4, box64 (steam_chrome branch) git cc3237a
1080p, default game setting

```bash
# working dir is $HOME
# prepare the game file with gogextract.py
# https://github.com/Yepoleb/gogextract.git
# https://framagit.org/IroAlexis/gogextract.git

cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yepoleb/gogextract/master/gogextract.py

# then I got the stardew-1.log, reminding me missing libs, 
# liblttng-ust.so libnuma.so libicuuc.so libFAudio.so libssl.so liburcu.so
# so I go to https://packages.debian.org/stable/libs/ to fetch them

### Logs
[stardew-1.log](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/10837011/stardew-1.log)
[stardew-2.log](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/10837012/stardew-2.log)


### Status
**Previous behavior:** 
<!-- If there is no known previous behavior (e.g. you're creating the issue) just put 'None reported' -->
Old version with .exe file can use mono trick to play the game.

**Current behavior:**
<!-- Can be similar to your desciption, just shorter and more concise -->
Segmentation fault

### Screenshots
<!-- Graphics, Glitches, 'Test-Case' Messages, ETC.  -->

### OpenGL
<!-- Did OpenGL is used. If yes, what profile (1.x, 2.x 3.x...). Also, is S3TC/DxTC used -->

### Additional Information
<!-- Any additional information such as configuration or other comments -->

Box64 (steam_chrome branch), compiled with
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr       \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
      -DRK3588=1                        \
      ..
```

libcoreclrtraceptprovider.so looks like .net, I'll furthur test it by replacing with older or newer debian x64 libs.

Thanks again for the awesome project. Since Stardew Valley is an interesting game to play and good to have latest version with full features, I wrote the above niebie stuff, hope it won't bother you too much and issue post here may benifit more gamers. Have a lovely day :)
