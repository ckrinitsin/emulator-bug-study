Compile Issues on Slarm64-15.0
I tried this on  a RazPI 4B running slarm64 using kernel 5.16.7 and the headers are a disaster. I quickly fell into a pattern of
1. make -j4 > ../../box64.err 2>&1
2. less ../../box64.err & note missing header.
3. locate <missing header>
4. sudo ln -s misplaced/missing header --> desired location
5. make -j4 > ../../box64.err 2>&1, etc...

I very quickly linked /usr/include/asm --> /usr/include/asm-generic. After about 30 iterations of these steps above, I got fed up, and used lndir to link /usr/include/asm & /usr/include/linux to the kernel source equivalents, but that's caused problems.  So I'll backtrack and remove my symlinks. Have you a precompiled version about? 

You can get slarm64 (an unofficial slackware64 distribution on Aarch64) from slarm64.org or slackware.uk/slarm64. There are binary images and good support on linuxquestions.org, where it has a forum (under distributions.
