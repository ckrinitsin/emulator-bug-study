musl support
Hi,

Thanks for this awesome project! I'd like to resurrect previous failed attempts of bringing musl support to box64. So far I've found standard type mismatches (easily fixable), but also there's a fair amount of `#define _GNU_SOURCE` across the code. What's the main purpose of it? From what it looks like, it can be made a global define via CMake if glibc (default) is used, and not applied for musl.

As for the missing glibc functions, there's this amazing project by [Ad√©lie Linux](https://git.adelielinux.org/adelie) team: https://git.adelielinux.org/adelie/gcompat , but I don't know what exactly do you need from glibc which's missing in musl.
