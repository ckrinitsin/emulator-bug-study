Consider wrapping FAudio
Lots of wine games are failing to launch for me because of FAudio. I have a x86_64 version of `libFAudio.so.0` but it depends on `libgstreamer-1.0.so.0` which in turn depends on `libgmodule-2.0.so.0` and I have not been able to get that to work either emulated or natively (wrapped).
Since FAudio is avialable for arm64 (and probably not too complicated?) maybe it would be easiest to wrap it in box64 to make using Wine easier.

EDIT: Different builds of FAudio (even of the same version) seem to have different dependencies for some reason. But I have not been able to make any one of them work. It would definitely be easier if FAudio was wrapped.
