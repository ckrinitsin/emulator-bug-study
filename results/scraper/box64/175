Running Minecraft BDS in box64 would crash
**platform**: aarch64 Android (tiny-ubuntu in termux)
**compile host**: as above

This issue is mentioned by #171, but they should not be recognized as the same issue, so I opened this issue additionally.

This is the copy of the issue description:

When I played for a while, the server suddenly crashed. This is the partial output:

~~~
