Build has been tested functional on x86_64 and the binaries have been determined to not be corrupted (same sha1sum of the entire directory for both the arm64 and x86_64 test systems). Able to be reproduced on multiple systems.

extract the build and reproduce by running: `./wine-8.18/bin/wine wineboot` and see that it hangs
