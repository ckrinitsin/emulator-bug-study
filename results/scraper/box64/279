Error: PageSize configuation is wrong (Apple M1/Asahi)
Hello. The app I am trying to run is the Reaper DAW. I installed according to the M1 instructions, and attempted to launch after rebooting my system, and I'm getting a PageSize error. (yes I know Reaper offers ARM builds for linux)

Thanks for any help.

```
$ ./reaper 
Dynarec for ARM64, with extension: ASIMD AES CRC32 PMULL ATOMICS PageSize:16384
Box64 with Dynarec v0.1.7 5538ffd built on Apr 12 2022 22:33:33
Error: PageSize configuation is wrong: configured with 4096, but got 16384
