libGLEW and libformw
I am getting these errors trying to run an x64 program on Arch Linux ARM (64):

> Error loading needed lib libGLEW.so.2.2
…
Using native(wrapped) libncursesw.so.6
Using native(wrapped) libtinfo.so.6
Error loading needed lib libformw.so.6
…
Error loading one of needed lib
Error initializing needed lib libgraphics.so
Error loading one of needed lib

(libgraphics appears to be getting emulated from the program's provided libgraphics.so; not certain if that matters here but included it for completeness of the errors.)

I've tried a bunch of the troubleshooting BOX64_ variables but haven't gotten any info on _why_ these couldn't be loaded.

libGLEW.so.2.2 and libformw.so.6 are in my /lib folder.
