Zoom: libc function missing (non-critical in this case)
```
Error: PltResolver: Symbol msgctl(ver 6: msgctl@GLIBC_2.2.5) not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT 0xffffa6c6ace0 (0xffffa208b1c6) in ./zoom
```

it doesn't result in a crash so I don't know if it is a high priority or not.

EDIT: just realized that this could have gone in the other issue... should I move this report to the other one?
