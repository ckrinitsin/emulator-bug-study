libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 - missing, but it's right there!
I'm trying to run zandronum. Box86 wants libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0.  Google says it's a part of libgtk2.0-0.  I fetch it and put it an a folder called missinglibs, export the environment variable saying to look there for it.  Box64 starts up, sees the folder, does not see the lib.  what can I do?
