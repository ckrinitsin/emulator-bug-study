Is there a plan to introduce a tracing jit compiler to optimize the jit code?
Hi ptitseb

Has box64 a plan to dev a complete tracing jit compiler? so that it can eliminate the redundancy brought by X86 code gen.

current implementation could improve the code layout, but a tracing jit compiler could focus the compilation on hot code, like a tracing, single entry multiple exit, and more optimization passes could be added easily to eliminate the redundancy during code generation, e.g. constant folding, propagation, CSE etc.
thank you.
