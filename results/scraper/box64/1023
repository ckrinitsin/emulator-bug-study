Garry's Mod x86_64 through wine, very slow loading times
Used box64 in Android, Termux proot with Ubuntu 22.04

Game: Garry's Mod x86_64 (Steam version using wine, due to android limitations, can't normally run steam and linux game version)

Expected behavior: loading times much faster than x86 ver,especially with mods

What actually happens: 10 minutes to load flatgrass map without any mods, with box86 regular gmod in same conditions loads in max 2 minutes
