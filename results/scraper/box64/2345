Compile instruction 'make install' does nothing?
I have been [compiling this on a RISC-V system](https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/65#issuecomment-2649116590), and after the `make -j4` step completes successfully, I ran `sudo make install` but that seems to do nothing:

```
ubuntu@ubuntu:~/Downloads/box64$ sudo make install
make: *** No rule to make target 'install'.  Stop.
```

Following the directions in the COMPILE.md file here: https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/docs/COMPILE.md#the-general-approach
