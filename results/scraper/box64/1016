Cannot dlopen d3dadapter9
When I was trying to use Gallium Nine, I encountered a very strange issue. It is very easy to trigger, at least on my part:

Load native arm64 d3dadapter9.so through the use of D3D_MODULE_PATH

Using BOX64_DUMP=1 and BOX64_DLSYM_ERROR=1, it seems to fail like this:

Call to dlopen("/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/glibc/lib/d3dadapter9.so"/0x1edac0, 102)

Trying to Get "/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/glibc/lib/d3dadapter9.so" to maplib

Trying to add "/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/glibc/lib/d3dadapter9.so" to maplib

Trying to load "/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/glibc/lib/d3dadapter9.so"

Simplified name is "d3dadapter9.so"

Faillure to create lib => fail

Warning: Cannot dlopen("/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/glibc/lib/d3dadapter9.so")

I had tried a few months ago from a prooted environment and it failed as well, even when not using the D3D_MODULE_PATH
