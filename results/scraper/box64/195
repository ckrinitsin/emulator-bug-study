Error: PltResolver when running don't starve together dedicated server
I'm trying to run a don't starve dedicated server under box64, after doing the installation process and running it the server starts but is unable to fetch mods or connect to the internet as well having `Error: PltResolver: Symbol curl_multi_timeout(ver 3: curl_multi_timeout@CURL_GNUTLS_3) not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT 0xa3c0d8 (0x408426) in /home/ubuntu/dont_starve/bin64/dontstarve_dedicated_server_nullrenderer_x64` around the logs as well some other issues when shutting down the server. Here are the full logs if needed https://gist.github.com/juanmuscaria/4aba335007df4c3f2b1b3e1955ef6911

I don't have much understanding of how box64 works, but here's a list of what I have tried so far:
* Checking if `libcurl3-gnutls` is installed, it is.
* Grabbing the libraries from an x86_64 system and dropping inside the lib64 folder and using `BOX64_EMULATED_LIBS=libcurl-gnutls.so.4` (A lot of other errors appeared by doing that)
* Restarting my system.
* BOX64_DYNAREC=0 (still same error)
