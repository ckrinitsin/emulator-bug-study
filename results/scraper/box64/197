Error loading needed lib libsqlite3.so.0
Hi, I am trying to setup a Rust server, but when the server is loading, i get this error:

Error loading needed lib /home/ubuntu/rustserver/RustDedicated_Data/Mono/libsqlite3.so.0

I have libsqlite3 installed in the system:

ubuntu@instance-20211220-1537:/snap/lxd/21843/lib$ which sqlite3
/usr/bin/sqlite3

ubuntu@instance-20211220-1537:/snap/lxd/21843/lib$ sudo find / -name libsqlite3.so
/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libsqlite3.so

I have tried to copy the file to rust folder, but its still not working?

How can i make this work?

Thanks
