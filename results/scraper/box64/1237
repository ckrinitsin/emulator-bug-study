Please consider providing an environment variable which disables box64.
Thanks to binfmt support, once installed, box64 is always "active" and will be used to interpret x86_64 binaries. Sometimes this is either not desired or client applications want to figure out what tool it is providing transparent x86_64 emulation via the binfmt_misc mechanism. Other providers of binfmt interpreters solve this via an environment variable. For example qemu has QEMU_VERSION which, if set, will disable emulation but just print the qemu version string when attempting to run a foreign architecture binary via binfmt_misc.

I'm asking for a similar mechanism for box64. Please consider making it possible to

 1. disable box64 via an environment variable
 2. figure out that it is box64 doing the emulation

This is also useful for the `arch-test` tool which has a `-n` switch, disabling known binfmt_misc providers by setting the respective environment variable.

I propose the `BOX64_VERSION` environment variable which, if set, would just print the box64 version and exit.

Thanks!
