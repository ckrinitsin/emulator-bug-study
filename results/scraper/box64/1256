Problems with Vulkan with latest Wine dev branch
Hey, this is just merely a suggestion.

Could you try compiling or running latest Wine 9.2?
I'm trying to figure the cause for Vulkan being broken. There are these three peculiar commits (related to Vulkan header updates and new extensions), which after reverting fixed Vulkan fully.

These are the commits on Wine dev branch:
05a0da8ab98af4ae0290643d42c5251a73f886a5
ea890c4733db5119fdb63b900bb7e5c8d04b5245
db03d2be88d80195635188cb51507f4c2d9c2b13

Running with them included I get this error:

```012c:err:msvcrt:_wassert (L"!status",L"../dlls/winevulkan/loader.c",271)``` 

I wanna find out what caused this big regression and I don't even know where to begin. Is it Box64, is it Wine or is it Mesa even?

Thank you once again.
