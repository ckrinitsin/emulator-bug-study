Box64 new version bugs
Hi, I compiled Box64 last time at the beginning of the month and everything worked fine.  Today I decided to update to the current version, and was faced with the fact that wine takes longer to load, and terrible graphics bugs with OpenGL, I returned to the old version and everything is fine.  Well, what could be the problem?
