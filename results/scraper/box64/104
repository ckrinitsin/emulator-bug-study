Run ms teams with box64
I've downloaded ms teams package and extracted it. Then I ran the binary which starts ms teams with box64. But this reports the error:
`Box64 with Dynarec v0.1.3 5b52859 built on Aug 23 2021 20:01:57
Using default BOX64_LD_LIBRARY_PATH: ./:lib/:lib64/:x86_64/:bin64/:libs64/

Error loading needed lib libgobject-2.0.so.0
Error loading one of needed lib
Error: loading needed libs in elf ./teams`
So there is the library libglib2.0-0 missing, which I have installed on my Debian 11 system on Raspberry pi 4. Is this library not supported by box64 or am I doing a mistake?
