Protontricks crashes bwrap launcher
I'm on a Raspberry Pi 5, and unfortunately Protontricks does not work, Protontricks is a useful tool for installing executables within certain runtime environments for Steam games or proton instances, It also helps in selling certain dependencies which do not exist in stock proton without needing to install a whole different version of proton.

Protontricks was installed using Python 3 and pipx.

The exact steps I followed are as follows.
1) Install Steam via PiApps(which also installs both Box86 and Box64)
2) Sign into Steam and install a proton-requiring game.
3) Install pipx with the following command: `sudo apt install pipx`
4) Install Protontricks via Python 3 using pipx: `python3 -m pipx install protontricks`
5) Upon a successful install, run `protontricks` and try to use it.

My Raspberry Pi 5, which I'm running this on, is running MX Linux 23.4, If there was a newer version, I would be running it. Any game in which either has a Linux native version or is a relatively janky engine like Plants vs. Zombies or Geometry Dash works fine. But the instant that I try doing any Windows only Unity or Unreal(Let's be honest, there is no way in hell any Unreal game was going to run on a pi) game, it gives me a DirectX 11 error, which is why I'm trying to install proton tricks and install the DirectX runtime, Also, I am mortified to compile the graphics driver from source because last time I did that using PiKISS, my entire system was stuck using LLVMPIPE For graphics rendering. And that is not ideal, especially if you want to play games.
