arc4random not found in lib libbsd.so.0
Trying to run Pathfinder: Kingmaker. I saw another issue that might have been something similar. #932 As I start up the game the start up gets stuck on
```
Warning: Global Symbol _ZN9__gnu__cxx21zoneinfo_dir_overrideEv not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT \@0x3f0024e268 ((nil)) in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
Looking for arc4random in loaded elfs
Warning, function arc4random not found in lib libbsd.so.0
```

I'm not sure it's even a box64 issue since it's using native libbssd.so.0, and I did write a test C program that used arc4random and it was able to build natively.
