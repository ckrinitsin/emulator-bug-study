Illegal Opcode 0x20ffe8: FF FF 41 00 00 00
I trying to run a free game [Street Fighter™ X Mega Man™](https://megaman.capcom.com/sfxmm/sfxmm_dl_uk.html)

I use wine-staging 8.11 that I downloaded from the ArchLinux repo from [here](https://archlinux.org/packages/multilib/x86_64/wine-staging/download/).

I run it as usual: `box64 path/to/wine SFXMMv2_EU.exe`.
 
Full output:
[log.txt](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/11859394/log.txt)

I use box64 compiled from source a few weeks ago.
