Steam Webhelper doesn't start
# What did I do?
- install Steam with PI Apps, it downloads the 64 debian packages and installs it
- the installer starts, downloads the full version and then the steamwebhelper crashes
- it shows this dialog: 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac0fe89e-270d-4882-b1ac-ad307c612ccb)
- it doesn't matter which option I choose, it will crash in the end

# what do I want?
- it used to work just a few weeks ago, so something might have changed in Steam or Box.
