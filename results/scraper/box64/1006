Unsupported Syscall 0x50h (80)
Hey, there!

While attempting to run TeamViewer QuickSupport under box64, I get an unsupported syscall:

```
Running on Icestorm-M1-Pro Firestorm-M1-Pro with 10 Cores
Params database has 21 entries
Box64 v0.2.2 nogit built on Oct  2 2023 12:09:22
Using default BOX64_LD_LIBRARY_PATH: ./:lib/:lib64/:x86_64/:bin64/:libs64/
Using default BOX64_PATH: ./:bin/
Counted 76 Env var
Looking for ./teamviewerqs/teamviewer
Rename process to "teamviewer"
Error: Unsupported Syscall 0x50h (80)
```

Obviously, I am running on an M1 Pro and I have enabled the `M1` CMake option, in case that's relevant here. Thanks for your help!
