BepInEx Support
### Describe your problem

No BepInEx support

### Proposed solution

Give some attention to BepInEx support; check it out, explain what is needed or missing etc. so other people can try stuff, or directly work on adding support for it. It took **3 years** and there is still no progress. Need input of knowledgeable people to help investigating what is needed. We don't even know which project needs to fix it..

I'm really sorry to make a "duplicate" issue but other issues are long forgotten and there is no attention. Pin one maybe?
