(Steam)(Linux)Slime Rancher 
when I realized that SlimeRancher was linux native, I rushed to install/try it out, but when I launched it, many testures failed to load and were black, the slimes and UI rendered correctly however... but none of the environment or the player is rendered correctly. and then roughly 30 seconds after launch the game just crashes with no popup or anything.
