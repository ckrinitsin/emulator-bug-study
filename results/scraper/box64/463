No logs, No/low sound under Aarch64
Because I wanted to make room on / for a swapfile, I removed the something of value and ended restoring a backup. Logs vanished after the first time I set BOX64_LOG=2 and never returned. I'm pretty sure that's coincidence. 

On my backup, there never was any trace log kept. Can you spot errors in this script?
`#!/bin/bash

BOX64_LOG=1
BOX64_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib:/usr/lib/x86_64
BOX64_PATH=/opt/zoom/:$PATH
BOX64_DYNAREC_LOG=2
BOX64_TTRACE_FILE=/home/dec/box64.err
#export $BOX64_LOG $BOX64_LD_LIBRARY_PATH $BOX64_PATH $BOX64_DYNAREC_LOG

cd /opt/zoom 
/usr/local/bin/box64 /opt/zoom/ZoomLauncher 
`
If I uncomment the 'export' line, the script spits syntax errors at me. The memory stays pretty full (≅3.3G vs ≤1.5G normally). My only approach was to run down some of those libraries that were being emulated. From the few logs I got, I spotted some libraries were native, others (a lot) were emulated. What does this mean exactly? You've no VM there.
Anyhow, I got busy with text mangling tools, and this is the list box64 says it's emulating. There is repetition. I'll finish with that list, but any ideas to improve the sound are welcome. I'll try it on a regular meeting tmw as I'm doing upstairs/downstairs test meetings and that sucks when you're an invalid.
