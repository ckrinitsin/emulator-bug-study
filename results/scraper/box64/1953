SEGFAULT running factorio headless server
### Environment
Device: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
OS: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) aarch64
Box64 version: `Box64 with Dynarec v0.3.1 2c2b252d built on Oct 22 2024 19:33:04`
Factorio headless server version: 2.08
### Description
Running the latest version of factorio headless server results in the following error
`47.422 Error CrashHandler.cpp:641: Received SIGSEGV`
### Reproduction
1. Download https://factorio.com/get-download/2.0.8/headless/linux64 and extract it
2. Run box64 bin/x64/factorio --start-server map.zip (map attached for convenience of not having to make a savefile yourself) [map.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17483268/map.zip)
3. Wait for it to SEGFAULT

My first try was with box64 from like two months ago, I tried again compiling box64 from latest commit with the same result

### Conclusion
A brief forum search lead me to [this post](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=621129#p621129)
Relevant quote from it:
> The biggest change is that it requires a newer glibc version 2.30.1

`apt show libc6` shows I have glibc 2.36-9+rpt2+deb12u8, but box64 reports the following when starting the server:
```
Look for __res_nquery in loaded elfs
Found symbol with version GLIBC_2.17, value = 0x7f9745bc30
Look for __dn_expand in loaded elfs
Found symbol with version GLIBC_2.17, value = 0x7f974546e0
```
Is the x86_64 glibc that box64 emulates something I can update on my own or is it something I should ask for here?
