[32bit] game cannot launch
The first issue for this game is the unimplemented opcode this has been fixed #865

new problem as I mentioned in [here](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/issues/865#issuecomment-1608013034)
the game cannot launch with or without dynarec.
i am not sure this box64 issue or wine
log with dynarec: [log](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/11872708/log.txt)
log without dynarec: [log](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/11872720/log1.txt) 

I'll close this issue if it wine issue
