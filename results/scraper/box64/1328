Slow NosTale performance on Mobox (Wine + box64 bundled for Android)
Not sure if it fits here, but anyway:
https://github.com/olegos2/mobox/issues/276

The game uses really old (and funky) engine that is not capable of calling drawing calls in optimized way.

It was described in this issue:
https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/1810

And partially fixed in these (for DXVK, anyway on phones it does still not work great as I would expect):
https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/2039
https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/2020
https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/2006
https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/1987

Can we do *anything* about it in this project? Also, I really appreciate your work - Box64 is really great! ðŸ¤Ÿ
