2. Run `BOX64_DYNAREC=1 box64 bin/x64/factorio --start-server map.zip` (map attached for convenience of not having to make a savefile yourself) [map.zip](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/files/12034082/map.zip)
3. Observe as it very slowly boots up and finally crashes

Case 2
1. Run `BOX64_DYNAREC=0 box64 bin/x64/factorio --start-server map.zip`
