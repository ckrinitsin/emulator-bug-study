CCS studio dependancy check failed due to 32 bit Libraries
Hey!
I tried installing Code Composer Studio on Ubuntu VM with the host as macOS.
It requires me to install the following libraries:
`sudo apt install libc6-i386 libusb-0.1-4 libgconf-2-4 libncurses5 libpython2.7 libtinfo5`

`libc6-i386` in particular is giving error, can't you please explain where I am going wrong? or is the app itself is not supported?
