[RPi4] Cannot get symbol in libicu
I tried to run ScourgeBringer and got a couple of symbols not found in the executable but most notably one in libicu. Based on what I read in other issues, I assume this is a symbol that's not wrapped yet but I'm not 100% sure.

This is all using the native Linux Steam version of ScourgeBringer, using Goldberg Emulator to disable the Steam API. The Goldberg Emulator I have confirmed to be working on multiple games that require Steam already including Jumpjet Rex and Chasm. Running on Raspberry Pi 4 4GB with latest Raspbian bullseye 64 bit, all packages up-to-date. I DID have to compile my own libicu as earlier logs reported box64 looking for v72 of the libs, which is not the one in Raspbian official packages (fairly unsurprising as I've had so many issues with raspbian libraries not being up to date with upstream x86/64 debian).

The two other missing symbols at the beginning I have no idea whether they play into the game crashing though.

Here's the log :
