Rivals of aether crashes
Hi! sorry for filing another report so soon after the last one, but I didn't see anyone else say anything about this. 
Rivals of aether is a game based on game maker studio 2, and when I try to launch it, it crashes after going through the loading screen with this error:
Game process removed: AppID 383980 "/home/user1/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/reaper SteamLaunch AppId=383980 -- /home/user1/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-launch-wrapper -- '/home/user1/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_soldier'/_v2-entry-point --verb=waitforexitandrun -- '/home/user1/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Proton - Experimental'/proton waitforexitandrun  '/home/user1/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Rivals of Aether/RivalsofAether.exe'", ProcID 5723
