Intel Linux64 version of nvm tool crashes with ioperm not found error
Hello, I am trying to run a x64 Linux binary provided by Intel to read out the NVM of my Intel i226 NIC on a Nvidia Orin Nano (Ubuntu 22.04, aarch64). 
Initially this worked once but after running the application for the second time the following error message occurs:

```
[BOX64] Warning, function ioperm not found in lib libc.so.6
[BOX64] Look for ioperm in loaded elfs
[BOX64] Warning, function ioperm not found in lib libc.so.6
[BOX64] Error: PltResolver: Symbol  delete_module(optver 2: delete_module@GLIBC_2.2.5) not found, cannot apply R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT 0x100534d48 (0x100014566) in eeview64e (local_maplib=(nil), global maplib=0x5c57b170, deepbind=0)
```
Is there any way to get around this issue?
