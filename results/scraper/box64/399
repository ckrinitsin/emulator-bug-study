(Feature Request) Something like FEXBash but for box64
This is not an issue but rather a feature request, FEX has something called FEXBash which allows you to run a bash shell where you can use arm64 and x86_64 software at the same time. I noticed that there is a bash x86_64 binary in the tests folder however you cannot run other x86_64 binaries using it.
```
root@localhost:~/box64-dynarec-debugging# ./box64-dynarec-debugging
execve("./box64-dynarec-debugging", 0x65e845f0, 0x65ce5fa0) is x64=0 x86=0 (my_context->envv=0x7874533e28, environ=0x7fe3e4e110
bash: ./box64-dynarec-debugging: No such file or directory
root@localhost:~/box64-dynarec-debugging#
```

This would be a nice feature to have as you can run bash scripts that use x86_64 binaries on systems which do not use binfmt.
