Adding a library to emulate
I am currently experimenting with a barebones libcef project, and seeing if I can get an app to at least open instead of crash, I have the libcef.so, however I cannot seem to figure out how to get box64 to emulate it. Is there any specific way I would have to direct to either its directory or location?
