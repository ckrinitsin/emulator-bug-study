[Question] Differences to similar solutions?
Hello there, first off, love what you're doing here, keep up the great work!

I wondered about what the differences/advantages of box86/box64 are to similar solutions. I hope you don't mind me putting this here, I thought since there is not much public available info on this topic this could be useful.

I'll put down a few guesses as well, would love to hear your input though!

Other projects I know:

- qemu-user
I guess the main point here is that qemu doesn't wrap libraries and runs all the userland, which should make box86 a lot faster. Correct?
- qemu code / unicorn engine
Since qemu is so far known, I can't help but wonder why you didn't base your emulation on that. It should be able to do JIT as well, and can be used with library wrapping (like wine-hangover). Maybe the point is that specializing on ARM allows you to do more optimizations? Or maybe qemu is too annoying to work with?
- FEX-Emu: Seems to do the same, but one project for both 32/64bit. Not sure if that makes any difference, or what's different in approach. Only think I found is a [comment on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/lkk7sf/fexemu_a_x86_and_x8664_linux_usermode_emulator/gnpuczt/), but it's not a lot to go by.

Thanks in advance
