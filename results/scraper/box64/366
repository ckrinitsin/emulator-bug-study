wine64 broken prefix
Hi, I am using box86 along with box86 and wine32/64 on my 64 bit Raspberry Pi OS. This seems to work for x86 apps without any problems, but when I try to run games on the amd64 architecture, I get an error creating a prefix for wine:

```
There is a problem initializing the Wine prefix!
Please make sure that you have set the WINEARCH variable to a correct value!
```

adding comands to .bashrc gives no result:

```
chewbacca@raspberrypi:~ $ echo $WINEPREFIX
/home/chewbacca/.wine
chewbacca@raspberrypi:~ $ echo $WINEARCH
win64
```

log about the creation of a broken prefix:

What could be the reason for this behavior and how do I fix it?
