"Box64 + Wine 9.17 on Orange Pi 3B: Wine Desktop forces emulated mode in TTY with startx"
**Description of the issue**

On my Orange Pi 3B, I am using box64 with Wine 9.17 (installed via Pi-Apps) on Armbian. When trying to run applications in a TTY environment with startx (RetroPie setup with EmulationStation), Wine behaves as if it is in "Wine Desktop" (emulated mode), preventing applications from running in full screen.

Additionally, even in an XFCE desktop environment, "Wine Desktop" does not handle window borders correctly and does not allow resizing or maximizing the windows properly.
**Steps to reproduce the issue**

    Set up an Armbian system on an Orange Pi 3B.
    Install box64 from [Pi-Apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps), which uses DEB packages from [this repository](https://github.com/Pi-Apps-Coders/box64-debs).
        Installed version: box64-generic-arm_0.3.3+20250113T062729.fd7d811-1_arm64.deb.
    Install Wine 9.17 via Pi-Apps.
    Launch a TTY environment without a desktop and use startx to run Wine applications.
    Observe how Wine behaves in "Wine Desktop."
    Alternatively, start XFCE and run a Wine application, observing the window handling issues.

**Expected behavior**

    In TTY with startx, Wine applications should display in full screen, as if running directly in the graphical environment.
    In XFCE, Wine windows should allow proper resizing and maximizing.

Actual behavior

    In TTY with startx, Wine always behaves as if running in "Wine Desktop," preventing full-screen applications.
    In XFCE, "Wine Desktop" does not handle window borders properly and does not allow resizing or maximizing.

**System Information**

    Device: Orange Pi 3B
    Operating System: Armbian based on Debian 12
    Box64 Version: box64-generic-arm_0.3.3+20250113T062729.fd7d811-1_arm64.deb
    Wine Version: 9.17 (installed via Pi-Apps)
    Graphical Environment:
        TTY with startx
        XFCE (issue observed here as well)



    _Box64 and Wine were installed using Pi-Apps, which fetches precompiled DEB packages from [this repository](https://github.com/Pi-Apps-Coders/box64-debs).
    This issue might be related to how box64 and Wine handle minimal graphical environments or specific configurations on ARM64 hardware like the Orange Pi 3B.
    I can provide additional configuration details or perform specific tests if needed._
