Step by step instruction how to use box64 with some example game/app
Would be nice to have some step by step instruction about how to use box64 with some particular example app or game. Now I'm not exactly sure how to proceed with it.

And a side question: is it possible to create native android apps with box64???
Would be happy if would be able to run these:
