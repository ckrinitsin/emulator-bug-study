Clarification on the Purpose of Red-Black Trees in Box64
I have noticed that in `custommem.c`, memory ranges mapped by mmap are simultaneously recorded and removed in multiple red-black trees.
Each node encapsulate a memory range along with detailed information about that range.
My question pertains to the necessity of using three distinct red-black tree nodes to record the same memory range. 
Is this approach taken solely to maintain three separate pieces of information related to each memory range?

 If that's the case, could a bitwise operation be implemented to consolidate the information, potentially reducing the number of trees required?
