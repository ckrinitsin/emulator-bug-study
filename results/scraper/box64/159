‘__int128’ is not supported on this target
So, before i got this error = `uint128_t does not name a type`
and then, when i add
`typedef __int128 int128_t;
typedef unsigned __int128 uint128_t;`
in `src/include/regs.h`
i got this error = `__int128 is not supported on this target`

My phone using arm64
and i run in Termux armv8l Debian armhf
is __int128 is not support for arm?

Sorry if my grammar is bad
