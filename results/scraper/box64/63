Missing lib downloader support
I have written a small script that downloads and extracts the missing libs automatically on being provided the name logged by box64 as a missing lib. It is a hasel to keep downloading and running only to find another dependency missing.

Is there a recommendation or any roadmap about incorporating something similar into box64/86 ?

I can share the bash script if not so.
