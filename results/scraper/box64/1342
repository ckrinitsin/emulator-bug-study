Palworld Dedicated Server stopped loading
I believe some changes to box64 code during the last week have broken the compatibility with Palworld server.
Everything was working fine with the latest versions of v0.2.7, but now the server does not load and gets stuck in an endless loop when I try to load it. This is what I get from systemd logs:

```

I was using ryanfortner apt repository to update my package once or twice a week, so unfortunately I haven't tested all the daily releases and I don't know how to determine exactly which version ended up causing the issue.
Downgrading back to the latest v0.2.6 release solves the issue and the server loads normally as expected.
I'm running an OCI Ampere instance with ubuntu 22.04, by the way.
I can add additional info if someone could guide me into collecting others logs.
Thank you.
