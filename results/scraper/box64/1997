How to compile box64 on kunpeng920
Hello, may I ask how to compile box64 on Kunpeng 920? When I tried to compile and run wine according to the default options, I encountered an error:
wine: failed to load /home/wine_things/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/ntdll.dll error c000007b
0024:err:environ:run_wineboot failed to start wineboot 1
wine: failed to load /home/wine_things/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/ntdll.dll error c000007b
Sigfault/Segbus while quitting, exiting silently
But the same box64 and wine can run normally on rk3588, does kunpeng920 require special compilation options
