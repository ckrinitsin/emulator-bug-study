(overclocking)(Pi5)Crash with higher CPU clock via memory errors.
I can't help but notice that games run through steam, of course. It's happened to crash due to memory errors at higher CPU clock speeds on the Raspberry Pi 5. I cannot say if this is the same for the Pi 4 as I have not tested it, I tried overclocking my Raspberry Pi to get better performance on it, and I did see some pretty decent results, however those results were short-lived, as box 64 then kicked up an error about memory address being wrong and then it crashed the whole game, Specifically, Terraria began to hold a substantially consistent 61 FPS and BatIM became playable... Does anyone else know why this is and why it's only affecting Box 64? As when I play Minecraft there is no effect and that steam has little to no effect either? It's only games running through a box64....
