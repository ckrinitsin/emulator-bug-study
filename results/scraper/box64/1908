Custom gamepad not working.
I am working on a project which will be running my Unity games on the Raspberry Pi 5 using box64, I got the games running and I have a controller working with it. I am working on making a custom controller using a Raspberry Pi Pico as the brain. When I try to use this controller in game it does not work while my actual controller does work.

I realize this sounds like an issue with my code but when I test the rp controller on [harwaretester.com](https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad)(on the same device), it works fine. I think my controller is not getting into box64 somehow. The code for my controller is [here](https://github.com/AndrewCromar/Andrew-Arcade/tree/main/gamepad/code/firmware) but I really don't think anything is wrong with the controller because it does work.

Is there any configuration that I have to do to get it to work?
