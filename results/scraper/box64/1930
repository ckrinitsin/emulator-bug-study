Protonup-qt appimage crashes with segfault
Running on Raspberry Pi 5 with MX Linux 23.4.

Reproduce the error by following these steps
1) In PiApps, install Steam which will install Box86 and Box64.
2) Download the Appimage of Protonup-qt from its official website.
3) Mark the appimage as executable(either by using `sudo chmod +x %filename%` or by right-clicking going to properties permissions and then ticking the allow executing as a program).
4) Open a terminal and launch app images like you would any other Linux executable, `./%filename%`.

(The reason that this app is desirable is it permits you to manage proton versions and other compatibility applications for specific steam games and in some cases even allows you to run certain games under a Linux native layer which removes a layer of compatibility that you need to run through(a welcome addition, or should I say subtraction? lol)
