Using BOX64_LD_PRELOAD to modify function arguments is ineffective.
I want to use `BOX64_LD_PRELOAD` to modify the arguments passed to a function. I have verified that this works on the x64 platform without any issues. However, when I use `BOX64_LD_PRELOAD=myintercept.so box64 myapp`  to make the modification, the log shows that the modification was successful, but the final result indicates that the arguments were not actually modified.
