Fallout 3 becomes unresponsive when loading ingame
This was only working on OpenGL last night on Apple silicon and now it doesn't. I looked and I couldn't find the regression, sorry. This one is able to be launched without steam even without the goldberg emulator I'm pretty sure so it might be easier to debug.
