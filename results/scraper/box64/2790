Zoom-6.5.3.2773 missing libs - How to trace?
I've got an Orange Pi 5 (4×A-76@2.4G & 4×A55@1.8G) with 8g of ram on Slackware64-aarch64-current). I've just built box64, Running zoom,It seems to be missing libs.

Box64 doesn't seem to have a documented debug option, and ldd won't operate on a x86_64 elf file. It' a fresh install, so I could well be missing stuff. But how do I find out?
