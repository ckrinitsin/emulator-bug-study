A question about rv64_lock
Sorry to bother you. When I'm trying to read box64's code, I find that in src/dynarec/native_lock.h, the rv64_lock_cas_d and rv64_lock_cas_dd functions compare the values of (A) and tmpcas, but in the rv64_lock_cas_b and rv64_lock_cas_h functions, the value of the tmpcas is abandoned. As shown in the figure, is that correct?

The value of ref is useless?
