Compiler errors on AArch64 GCC7
Starting yesterday, we started getting multiple Box64 compilation errors.
I've verified and can reproduce on ubuntu bionic 18.04 aarch64 with default gcc7

I am not sure which change caused this, but I know I was able to build successfully 14 days ago on commit:07a65d4
