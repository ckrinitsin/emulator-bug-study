qemu mingw 32bit windows crash

is it a known bug that in windows that even if you do ./configure --disable-coroutine-pool it still builds the coroutine stuff so when you try and run the build after its compiled it crashses? you have to actually edit config-host.mak and change the c flags around.

Which QEMU version did you use? Can you still reproduce this with the latest release?

Oh sorry this has been working fine consider this resolved.
