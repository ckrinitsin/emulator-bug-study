man page is missing suboptions for "-display"

Some of the display options have suboptions, for example:

> -display gtk[,grab_on_hover=on|off][,gl=on|off]

None of these suboptions are currently documented in qemu-options.hx (checked git@f04ec5a)

Display suboptions are still undocumented as of 5.2...



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
