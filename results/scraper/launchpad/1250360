qcow2 image logical corruption after host crash

Description of problem:
In case of power failure disk images that were active and created in qcow2 format can become logically corrupt so that they actually appear as unused (full of zeroes).
Data seems to be there, but at this moment i cannot find any reliable method to recover it. Should it be a raw image, a recovery path would be available, but a qcow2 image only presents zeroes once it gets corrupted. My understanding is that the blockmap of the image gets reset and the image is then assumed to be unused.
My detailed setup :

Kernel 2.6.32-358.18.1.el6.x86_64
qemu-kvm-0.12.1.2-2.355.0.1.el6.centos.7.x86_64
Used via libvirt libvirt-0.10.2-18.el6_4.14.x86_64
The image was used from a NFS share (the nfs server did NOT crash and remained permanently active).

qemu-img check finds no corruption;
qemu-img convert will fully convert the image to raw at a raw image full of zeroes. However, there is data in the file, and the storage backend was not restarted, inactivated during the incident.
I encountered this issue on two different machines, in both cases i was not able to recover the data.
Image was qcow2, thin provisioned, created like this :
 qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o cluster_size=2M imagename.img

While addressing the root cause in order to not have this issue repeat would be the ideal scenario, a temporary workaround to run on the affected qcow2 image to "patch" it and recover the data (eventually after a full fsck/recovery inside the guest) would also be good. Otherwise we are basically losing data on a large scale when using qcow2.

 

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
Kernel 2.6.32-358.18.1.el6.x86_64
qemu-kvm-0.12.1.2-2.355.0.1.el6.centos.7.x86_64
Used via libvirt libvirt-0.10.2-18.el6_4.14.x86_64

How reproducible:
I am not able (and don't have at the moment enough resources to try to manually reproduce it), but the probability of the issue seems quite high as this is the second case of such corruption in weeks.
Additional info:
I can privately provide an image displaying the corruption.

The reported problem has actually two aspects : first is the cause that eventually produces this issue.
The second is the fact that once the logical corruption has occured, qemu-img check finds nothing wrong with the image - this is obviously wrong.

Please post the qemu command-line (ps aux | grep qemu) for the affected

What kind of workload is accessing the disk?  Guest OS and version?

Please also confirm that nothing else is accessing the image file while
the VM is running.  It is not safe to use tools like qemu-img on the
file while the VM has it open.

Interesting note, you are setting a custom cluster size.  It should work
but it's not the default configuration that is well-tested.

Please send a link to <email address hidden> and <email address hidden>.  We can
help you inspect the image to determine the nature of the corruption and
what data can be restored.

Indeed, it's the same issue, i opened the report @ centos, redhat and here. Thank you Kevin for posting the link before I got to do it :)
Can we link the reports like we can in rhel-centos bugzilla ?

Did this issue happen ever again with a recent version of QEMU? ... if not, should we close this bug nowadays?

Since then, I switched all my vm images to (sparse) raw  and never
experienced corruption problems again.
I could not say if this can still be reproduced today, even then it was
probably a corner case.
I would suggest the closing of the issue as we cannot gather newer and more
relevant data.

Ok, so let's close this now. Thanks for your reply!
