Feature Request:  Please add TCG OPAL 2 emulation support to the virtio disk emulation

In order to allow windows guests (and soon, linux guests) which are TCG OPAL 2 aware to perform disk encryption in a native fashion with hardware acceleration, please add TCG OPAL 2 emulation to the VIRTIO driver.  

Encryption should occur at the host level using any cryptographic facilities available to the host, for example AES-NI, Cryptography Hardware, underlying block device cryptography support where available or any other cryptography facility that may be developed and implemented in the future.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
