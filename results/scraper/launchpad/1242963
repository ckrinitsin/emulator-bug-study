QEMU loadvm causes guest OS freeze

HOST: ubuntu 13.10 x64
GUEST: winxp sp 3 x86

AFFECT QEMU(tested): v1.5.2, v1.5.3,  v1.6.0, v1.6.1

I compile QEMU by myself with "./configure --target-list=i386-softmmu && make && make install".
After installing a winxp sp3 into the qemu-system-i386 with command line:
> qemu-system-i386 -m 512 -hda xp.img -net user -net nic,model=rtl8139 -rtc base=localtime,clock=vm

I use monitor to create a live snapshot: 
> stop
> savevm xxx
> cont

And then I load this snapshot (I also try it in commad line: -loadvm xxx):
> loadvm xxx
> cont

After that, the windows system is freeze (don't accept any keyboard or mouse input, although I knew vcpu is still working).

If I compile with -enable-kvm and launch qemu-system-i386 with -enable-kvm, it looks like everything works well.
I think it is a bug for qemu system.

BTW: freeze is not appearing 100%, but in my test, 95% cases would cause system freeze.

Hi guys,

This bug has reported in a very long time.  I have tested v1.7.0, v1.7.1 and even v2.0.0rc1, v2.0.0rc2.
The bug is still there. This is very easy to reproduce. I dunno why it is not fixed until today.

I think living-snapshot is a very important feature for Qemu. Somebody can take a look at this issue.
Or at least, give me some tips to let me know how to fix this?

Thanks!


I found something, hope this could be useful.

Pinging this as I'm running into the same issue, Win7 seems to be fine as a guest, just getting this with XP (SP3).

I'm 99% certain that 1.5.0 was still fine. I looked at the commits between that and 1.5.2 but did not really see anything obvious that could cause it.

I have the same bug, is there any news concerning a fix?

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
