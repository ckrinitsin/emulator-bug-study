Random errors when emulating armv7 and using dh

Howdy,
I'm encountering random errors when using qemu to cross-package my project using dh. In previous iterations of my project it would only fail once every two attempts. Now it fails every time.

Example error included.



If you'd like to try and replicate this error, a version of my project is publicly available with simple instructions on how to package it (using qemu) here:
https://github.com/Nadav-Ruskin/configsite



The ioctl warnings are I think for BTRFS_IOC_CLONE, which are probably harmless (the calling program ought to cope with it not working and fall back to something else).

Which version of QEMU are you using ?

(Unfortunately the log is not very revealing about what has gone wrong: it says "Running setup.py bdist_wheel for itsdangerous ... error" but gives no detail about what the error was. Is it possible to get the python build/install process to be more verbose?)


Thank you for the quick reply.

Version:
nadav@DESKTOP-4DUIS04:/mnt/c/Git/configsite$ dpkg -s qemu-user-static | grep Version
Version: 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.4


A log with verbose mode enabled is attached.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
