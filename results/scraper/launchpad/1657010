RFE: Please implement -cpu best or a CPU fallback option

QEMU should implement a -cpu best option or some other way to make this work:

qemu -M pc,accel=kvm:tcg -cpu best

qemu -M pc,accel=kvm:tcg -cpu host:qemu64

Instead of having a new CPU model called "best", we can simply make "-cpu host" available on TCG. I have submitted a patch for this yesterday:

I think we've ended up with '-cpu max', present since QEMU 2.9 for x86 and perhaps for some other architectures, but not Arm yet.


As far as I can see, we have "-cpu max" now for x86, arm, ppc and s390x ... is that enough, so that we can close this bug now?
