'set_link net0 off' not working with e1000e driver

I'm encountering a bug with the e1000e network driver, that appears to got previously reported at rhbz. Steps to reproduce are provided in detail there:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707646

It is about switching off network link state (set_link net0 off) having no effect when using the e1000e driver.

Version details:
QEMU emulator version 4.1.1 (qemu-4.1.1-1.fc31)
Fedora 31

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


Still reproducible on Fedora 34 with QEMU 5.2.0.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
