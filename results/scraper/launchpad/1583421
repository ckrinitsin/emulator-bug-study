Please provide an option to print the default hardware configuration as command-line options, to make -nodefaults easier to use

For full customization of the default set of hardware qemu supports, a user can pass -nodefaults and then manually specify each device they want.  Many specific options document what they translate to in terms of the full configuration model; however, the defaults for any given platform don't.

I'd love to have documentation of the default hardware configuration, in terms of qemu command-line options, to make it easy to run qemu -nodefaults, paste in the default command-line, and edit it.

As this varies by emulated machine, perhaps qemu could have a command-line option to print a specific machine (e.g. pc-i440fx-2.5) in the form of qemu command-line options?

I think that just plain configuration in the manual could be enough.
The command line option is a very good idea, indeed.
Maybe also a monitor command could be helpful.

It's also necessary to document default hardware configuration of each past release, because using defaults becomes a problem to keep guest OS licenses when upgrading Qemu version.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
