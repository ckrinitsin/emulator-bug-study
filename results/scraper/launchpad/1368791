qemu build fails on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS since recent pixman changes

Since commit 0dfa7e30126364c434a48cb37a1a41119e536c2a, the qemu git mainline no longer builds on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.  The build fails with:

  CC    ui/input.o
ui/qemu-pixman.c: In function 'qemu_pixelformat_from_pixman':
ui/qemu-pixman.c:42: error: 'PIXMAN_TYPE_RGBA' undeclared (first use in this function)
ui/qemu-pixman.c:42: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
ui/qemu-pixman.c:42: error: for each function it appears in.)
make: *** [ui/qemu-pixman.o] Error 1

Since 10.04 is already end-of-life, I'm closing this bug now. If you still have problems with newer versions of Ubuntu, please open a new bug instead.
