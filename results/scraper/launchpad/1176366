TCPIP not working on qemu 1.4.50 (master)

whenever I try, in the guest OS, in this case it's NT 3.1, to enable TCP/IP, it crashes the whole emulator. With either the ne2000 isa, ne2000 pci or PCnet, still crashes

below is attached a screenshot.

looks like it also happens in 1.5.0-rc1, will check later with git bisect in the latest git release based on rc1.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
