qemu-user fails to run rpcgen (i386, x86_64)

Confirmed on qemu current development tree (git commit aa29141). While trying to run eglibc's rpcgen from native system by qemu-user, I get an error:

qemu-x86_64 /usr/bin/rpcgen -c /dev/null 
fork: Invalid argument

I am running a Debian Wheezy system and rpcgen comes from libc-dev-bin. Just in case I am attaching my rpcgen binaries from i386 and x86_64 systems.

Very similar problem was mentioned on the QEMU forum on February 2007, so I guess it might be a known issue. Nevertheless, I was unable to find any information about bug reports, fixes nor workarounds for it so I'm reporting it here.



This should be fixed in QEMU 1.6.
