CVE-2017-7471 repeated?

In the hw/9pfs/9p-proxy.c file I can see the following which is changed because of CVE-2017-7471 in the hw/9pfs/9p-local.c. I might be wrong but I guess that should be changed as well. 

if(dir_path){
v9fs_path_sprintf(target,"%s/%s",dir_path->data,name);
}
else{
v9fs_path_sprintf(target,"%s",name);
}

When using the proxy backend, all accesses to the host filesystem are handled by an external process running in a chroot() jail. No need to bother about paths in this case.

CVE-2017-7471 is only applicable to the local backend, because accesses are handled by QEMU directly in this case.
