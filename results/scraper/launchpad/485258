64-bit win2003r2 with sp2 64-bit with network type rtl8139 generates blue screen after running network test

64-bit win2003r2 with sp2 64-bit with network type rtl8139 generates blue screen after running network test

Steps to recreate:
1) install qemu frm git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/qemu.git

2)Download Soap Stone Benchmark(http://soap-stone.sourceforge.net/) and IBM java 1.4 for windows

3)use  win2k3r2sp2 64-bit as the server and win2k3r2sp2 32-bit as client (this bug does not occur when win2k3r2sp2 64-bit is the client)

4) Running the test will reset the  network interface on the server(win2k3r2sp264bit).

5)Then shutdown the server(win2k3r2sp2 64bit), which will generate a blue screen.


Qemu cmd line used:

Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU?
