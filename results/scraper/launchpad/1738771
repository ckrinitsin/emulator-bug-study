qemu user does not provide AT_SECURE auxiliary vector entry

When executing an android native binary using qemu in user mode, the program fail with the message

FATAL: kernel did not supply AT_SECURE

Android uses bionic libc.The linker requires that AT_SECURE is provided in the auxiliary vector, but qemu does not provide the entry.

The issue can be reproduced using the commands:

mkdir -p /tmp/android/system
cd /tmp/android
curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sys-img/google_apis/sysimg_x86-21_r15.zip
unzip sysimg_x86-21_r15.zip
mount -o loop x86/system.img system
qemu-i386 -L /tmp/android/ system/bin/ls


I've provided a patch (https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-10/msg03667.html) to fix the issue, but it was not reviewed yet.

A patch to add AT_SECURE went in and was released in QEMU 2.12.
