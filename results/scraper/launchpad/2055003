ERROR:../tcg/region.c:782:tcg_region_init: assertion failed: (region_size >= 2 * page_size)
Bail out! ERROR:../tcg/region.c:782:tcg_region_init: assertion failed: (region_size >= 2 * page_size)
Aborted (core dumped)

Expected Result:
Warning message like "Number of cpus requested exceeds the cpus supported"

Actual Result:
core dumped

Steps to Reproduce:
--------------------

1. Clone the upstream qemu from https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu.git
2. Compile qemu with below steps.
    cd qemu/
    git submodule init
    git submodule update --recursive
    ./configure --target-list=ppc64-softmmu --prefix=/usr
    make
    make install
3. set maxcpus=8193 or more

Action needed

Our IBM Dev want to include this patch in latest Canonical distro.

Need the distro to review and integrate fixes provided by IBM 

https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/c4f91d7b7be76c47015521ab0109c6e998a369b0

Need to include this commit in latest Canonical distro.

FWIW, this bug tracker is not used for qemu for a long time.  See https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/ instead.

Hi Michael,
as I read it this is just for tracking the integration of the patch which is already upstream to go into Ubuntu - in that case the tracker is correct.

But it was wrong in the beginning, yet Frank fixed it and your comments raced.

@Frank maybe some teaching needed to have bugproxy open it in the right place to begin with?


quilt patch for commit c4f91d7b7be

This bug was fixed in the package qemu - 1:8.2.1+ds-1ubuntu8

---------------
qemu (1:8.2.1+ds-1ubuntu8) noble; urgency=medium

  * d/p/u/lp2012763-maxcpus-too-low.patch: Actually set the max_cpus
    property of the new Mantic machine types. (LP: #2012763)
