GTK fullscreen mode start stretched but fixes after leaving and returning full screen mode

I'm running QEMU 2.2.91 compiled directly from git and starting QEMU with the -full-screen option. The guest OS is Windows 8.1 using the VGA driver from QEMU.

The image can be fixed leaving the full-screen mode and returning it back. So it appears that QEMU loses the information with multiple resolution changes of the boot process and fails in the end.

The description can be a little confusing, so I've put a video on Youtube, so it can demonstrate the real issue:

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU and the latest version of GTK? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
