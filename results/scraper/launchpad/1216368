unsupported screen resolution crashes sdl-qemu

if the (windows) guest sets a screen resolution that the SDL backend does not support,
qemu does an exit(1).
with this fix, the the resolution is still wrong (only part of the desktop is displayed),
but qemu keeps running and the guest can auto-revert the video mode:

ui/sdl.c:do_sdl_resize()
    SDL_Surface * tmp_screen;
    tmp_screen = SDL_SetVideoMode(width, height, bpp, flags);
    if (!tmp_screen) {
//      fprintf(stderr, "Could not open SDL display (%dx%dx%d): %s\n", width, 
//              height, bpp, SDL_GetError());
//      exit(1);
    } else {
        real_screen = tmp_screen;
    }

Sorry, a little confusion what's the problem you want to solve?

its in the first sentence. let me rephrase: the (windows) guest can select some screen resolution which SDL cannot
provide. what happens is that qemu quits without giving the quest a chance to shut down. thats like having a monitor
that crashes windows when it doesnt support the video mode.

Yes, it is a bug. It should go back to the previous setting if the new screen resolution falied.
I will send a patch later. 

Thanks.
