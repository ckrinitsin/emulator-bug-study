warning: host doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.01H:ECX.vmx

I encountered the bug today:

warning: host doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.01H:ECX.vmx

My Ubuntu have this version of QEMU installed:

qemu-system-x86_64 --version

QEMU emulator version 2.5.0 (Debian 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.16), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

And PC is a AMD Ryzen7 CPU built, and since it is not Intel CPU:

From other places, it can be seen that this is an AMD CPU issue:

Hi,
this is not a show stopper at all.
It is just a warning and it is fine.
It is a trade-off between the "ease to use nested virt" vs "this warning".
For example on an intel chip you'd get:
  qemu-system-x86_64: warning: host doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.svm
And that as well is no issue.

Since this is Ubuntu downstream decision to prefer simplicity for nested virt I marked upstream qemu task invalid. There you'd not see the warning, but instead would have to jump a few extra whoops to get nesting working.

And finally, this code really is like that for longer than I take a look at it, so it might be that today one could solve it differently. There could be much more magic code to make it work as comfortable on both platforms and avoid the warning, but honestly - it wasn't an issue for many years, and I think it still is none.
So for the Ubuntu portion, I'll set confirmed+low(est) prio until it is clear that this really breaks something it didn't in the past years.

And sorry for the status update noise, one can clearly see that I start to fail once I have to use my mouse :-)

How is this a bug?

Hi,
Ken - I think all I said in comment #2 still applies (and likely won't change).

It really is a non-issue warning - and even if you e.g. have a zero-warning-allowed policy then you can easily avoid that by using a CPU type that doesn't enable it by default or switch it on/off as needed. In libvirt that would be via CPU features [1] and in qemu via +/- flags on the -cpu switch. Like [2] but for vmx/svm flags.

Note that:
 $ qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu help
will show you all the types and features known to your current qemu.
