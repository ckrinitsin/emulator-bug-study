Add multiboot2 support

multiboot2 is a recent specification that resolves some of the issues of multiboot. Multiboot2 is supported by some tools already (e.g. grub).

It would be great if one can run OS with multiboot2 using '-kernel' option, similar as it is done now with multiboot images.

Quick googling shows there is a Debian bug and patch that adds multiboot support https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=621529 Would it be possible to integrate it to QEMU upstream?

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


Marking new to migrate to the new bug tracker.

It would be really great to see this in QEMU!


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
