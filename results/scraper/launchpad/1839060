HDA device non functional in Windows 10 1903

I made the update to 1903, and the HDA device stopped working.

The driver says the device is working correctly, but it does not.
When I try to open the Windows sound configuration, the dialog hangs and never shows it's content.

Several people reported this back in May:

https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-v1903-ich6-ich9-virtio/

I can confirm I have exactly the same problem.

Host is Arch Linux, current (5.2.5) kernel, QEMU 4.0.

I enabled HDA debug output and compared an older, working Windows version to 1903, but could not see the difference. The driver seems to issue the same verbs.

I am happy to provide additional information if needed.

I've got the same issue. Had to rollback to 1809.

The working driver is named:
10.0.17763.1 (WinBuild.160101.0800) from 14th sept 2018

The non-working driver is:
10.0.18362.1 (WinBuild.160101.0800) from 18th march 2019

I'm not sure if this bug report should be reported to qemu tho. We should probably file a bug report to Microsoft as well.

Hi,

I am trying to dig into this issue, can you please provide the verb debug trace from the working version of windows.

Tried sending you a message @ginf, but haven't heard back from you so I'm posting here instead;
What kind of debug trace do you want me to give you logs from?
$ /opt/qemu4/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -d help
Log items (comma separated):
out_asm         show generated host assembly code for each compiled TB
in_asm          show target assembly code for each compiled TB
op              show micro ops for each compiled TB
op_opt          show micro ops after optimization
op_ind          show micro ops before indirect lowering
int             show interrupts/exceptions in short format
exec            show trace before each executed TB (lots of logs)
cpu             show CPU registers before entering a TB (lots of logs)
fpu             include FPU registers in the 'cpu' logging
mmu             log MMU-related activities
pcall           x86 only: show protected mode far calls/returns/exceptions
cpu_reset       show CPU state before CPU resets
unimp           log unimplemented functionality
guest_errors    log when the guest OS does something invalid (eg accessing a
non-existent register)
page            dump pages at beginning of user mode emulation
nochain         do not chain compiled TBs so that "exec" and "cpu" show
complete traces
trace:PATTERN   enable trace events

Use "-d trace:help" to get a list of trace events.


Microsoft has updated their driver to 10.0.18362.356 and the sound is now working with the audoidev hda.

Microsoft has fixed their hda driver
