qemu-system-ppc64 by default has non-working keyboard

Compile qemu from git and do:

  ./ppc64-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc64

(ie. no parameters).  It boots to an OpenBIOS prompt.  However the keyboard doesn't work.  After ~10 keypresses, qemu just says:

usb-kbd: warning: key event queue full
usb-kbd: warning: key event queue full
usb-kbd: warning: key event queue full
usb-kbd: warning: key event queue full

There is no indication inside the guest that OpenBIOS is seeing keyboard events.

Also there's no indication of what type of keyboard devices are available, nor what we should use.

I have also experienced the same issue with qemu-system-ppc64. It appears that ppc64 is not able to communicate with the USB controller. This issue is not seen with with qemu-system-ppc.

AFAIK an OHCI driver has been added to OpenBIOS in 2014, so marking this bug as fixed now. If you still have issues with OpenBIOS, please report them to the OpenBIOS project instead of the QEMU bug tracker, thanks!
