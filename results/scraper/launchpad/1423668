Unable to set scsi drive serial if it contains spaces.

I am virtualzing a physical server for which I need to set the SCSI/SATA drive serial.  It is comprised of 12 " " spaces then 8 letter/digits.  If I exclude the spaces, the drive serial is not accurate.  If I include the spaces I get the following error.

error: Failed to start domain test1
error: internal error: driver serial '            ABCD1234' contains unsafe characters
