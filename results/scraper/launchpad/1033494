qemu-system-x86_64 segfaults with kernel 3.5.0

qemu-kvm 1.1.1 stable is running fine for me with RHEL 6 2.6.32 based kernel.

But with 3.5.0 kernel qemu-system-x86_64 segfaults while i'm trying to install ubuntu 12.04 server reproducable.

You find three backtraces here:

this thread and this fix http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/95314/focus=1338226 are about the same issue, apparently.  Please try it and see if it fixes you issue too.
