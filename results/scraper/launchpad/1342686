Windows 95 setup hangs

Windows 95 (first version, not 95A or OSR2) setup hangs on QEMU version 2.0.0. It was compiled from the sources on Fedora 20. 
Setup starts without problems, it goes through the first phase and then hangs on the "Getting ready to run Windows 95 for the first time..." screen (http://www.guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win95#win95startupshutdownsplash1correctaspect).

Steps to reproduce:
qemu-img create -f qcow2 win95.img 2G
qemu -L . -machine isapc -cpu pentium -m 32 -vga std -soundhw sb16 -hda win95.img -cdrom POLWIN95.ISO -fda BOOT95A.IMA -boot a
after this select default options everywhere. When it asks to remove the boot floppy do "eject floppy0" and confirm.
It displays the "Getting ready to run Windows 95 for the first time..." and hangs.

The same behavior can be observed on 2.1.0-rc2. On 1.7.1 It hangs immediately after this screen, it hangs on displaying a underscore cursor.

I managed to complete the setup on QEMU 1.6.2.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

I've tried the recent QEMU 2.10 (Windows build qemu-w64-setup-20171006.exe) and the bug is still there. It hangs right after "Getting ready to run Windows 95 for the first time..." screen.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
