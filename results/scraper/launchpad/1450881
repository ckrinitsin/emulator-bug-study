qemu-system-sparc MUTEX_HELD assert and libC lock errors

Here I am cross-posting a comment I made on Artyom's blog.  Atar responded that he "fixed these issues for some customers".  I hoped that opening a bug to the opensource project might help develop the solution for the public domain.

I now have a mostly-working Solaris 6 emulation, with great thanks to the valuable information in Artyom's blog, brezular.com, and the QEMU/Solaris 4.14 wikibook.

setup detail;
QEMU (present git snapshot, reports --version 2.2.92)
-M SS-20, openboot/proprietary prom

# uname -a
SunOS emu0 5.6 Generic_105181-33 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20

I continue to have a problem, which I have found others posted in blog comments, but have not seen a resolution yet.

# /etc/init.d/init.dmi start
Run-time error, libC:
Trying to release a lock that was not acquired in this thread
(repeat above 1x)
Abort - core dumped

as well as:
Assertion failed: MUTEX_HELD(&svc_mutex), file rpc/svc_run.c, line 766

which prints to the console periodically when "dmispd" is running.

Yes, this is a known issue which I can reproduce using a Solaris installation. I still have a few outstanding bugs on my list to do before I can start looking into this one, but I will keep this bug up to date as/when I can start work on it - apologies for not being able to be more specific than this at the moment.


Hi all,
I also have this issue with my sparcstation installation :

Emulated OS				: 	SunOS 5.5.1
Emulated Processor			: 	sparc
Host machine OS			:	Linux RED HAT

Do you manage to fix it ?

Not yet - things have been made much harder now as my original test image tends to hang for long periods of time instead of giving the MUTEX_HELD error. If you have an image that you would be willing to share for debugging, please get in touch via email and I'll try and take a look.

Proposed patch posted to mailing list: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-04/msg01645.html - please test and report back.

-                        tcg_gen_qemu_ld8s(cpu_val, cpu_addr, dc->mem_idx);
+                        tcg_gen_qemu_ld8u(cpu_val, cpu_addr, dc->mem_idx);

I confirmed this patch resolves MUTEX_HELD errors on a minimal testcase
solaris 6 image.
Thank you!

Excellent - thanks once again for all your help!

Fix is included in the 2.6.0-rc2 release.
