x86 f1 opcode hangs qemu

I have qemu installed and running in linux and windows
in linux i execute the following simple code in real mode of cpu in my vm
90 nop
90 nop
90 nop
f1         ;this should conjure up my interrupt handler from ivt int 1
--------- end of code ----
it works properly in vbox,qemu linux,and even in my boot loder
on a real platform
   it doeas not work fine in windows 10 (32 bit efi) based qemu
---
all of the below was retyped there may be typo
so onwards to the flawed software 
********** for qemu-system-x86_64.exe **********
info version 
4.2.0v4.2.0.11797-g2890edc853-dirty
********** for qemu-system-i386.exe **********
info version 
4.2.0v4.2.0.11797-g2890edc853-dirty
***********************************************
my startup code is
"d:\programs\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe" -m 16M -boot a -fda "d:\floppy.img" -cpu Nehalem -machine pc
---
also same flaw if i change above section to
"d:\programs\qemu\qemu-system-i386.exe"

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
