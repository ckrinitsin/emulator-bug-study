v2.8.0 won't compile if g++ compiler doesn't understand "-fstack-protector-strong"

For example, Ubuntu Trusty (LTS 14.04) uses g++ v4.8.5.
Compilation fails with a syntax error saying that the ""-fstack-protector-strong" option in g++ is unrecognized.
Instead, under Ubuntu Xenial (LTS 16.04), the g++ compiler is v5.4.0 and the compilation goes on smoothly.

Could you provide the command you've used?
I tried `CC=gcc-4.8 ./configure --enable-stack-protector && make` in Ubuntu 14.04 and qemu v2.8.0. It didn't set `-fstack-protector-strong` flag, only `-fstack-protector-all`.

Which version of gcc (i.e. normal C-compiler, not g++) did you use here? Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest release of QEMU?
