Overwrite argv to set process title, eliminating 16-character prctl() limit.

I've modified qemu to overwrite its arguments to set the process title, since its current prctl() method has a 16-character limit.

I posted the original patch to qemu-devel, made the changes others suggested, then re-posted to qemu-devel. I flailed around a bit with the patch submission process and think I finally got it right, but haven't been able to gain the notice of a committer to have this pushed. Maybe this will get more attention when reported in the BTS.



The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
