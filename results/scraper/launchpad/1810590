Record/replay example does not work

Trying the record part of the record/replay example at https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/docs/replay.txt qemu immediately hangs with no guest output displayed.  This is with qemu from today's git (e59dbbac0364344a3ad84c3497a98c56003d3fb8).

To reproduce:

  wget https://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/i386/debian_squeeze_i386_standard.qcow2

  mv debian_squeeze_i386_standard.qcow2 disk.qcow2

  qemu-system-i386 \
       -icount shift=7,rr=record,rrfile=replay.bin \
       -drive file=disk.qcow2,if=none,id=img-direct \
       -drive driver=blkreplay,if=none,image=img-direct,id=img-blkreplay \
       -device ide-hd,drive=img-blkreplay \
       -netdev user,id=net1 -device rtl8139,netdev=net1 \
       -object filter-replay,id=replay,netdev=net1

The above qemu command line is exactly the same as in the example.

Tested on a Debian 9 x86_64 host.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
