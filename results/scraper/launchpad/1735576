Support more than 4G memory for guest with Intel HAXM acceleration

setup:

host: windows 7 professional 64bit
guest: centos 7
qemu 2.10.92
haxm 6.2.1

issue: when assign 4096M or more memory to the guest, I got following error message:
E:\qemuvm\vm-svr>qemu-system-x86_64 -accel hax -hda centos-1.vdi -m 4096
HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virt mode.
Failed to allocate 0 memory

hax_transaction_commit: Failed mapping @0x0000000100000000+0x40000000 flags 00

if I change memory to 4095M, guest VM boot up without issue

E:\qemuvm\vm-svr>qemu-system-x86_64 -accel hax -hda centos-1.vdi -m 4095

This is known limitation, I already raised a request on HAXM github site for fix this: https://github.com/intel/haxm/issues/13, and it got accepted will be fixed in next haxm release; however it seems there is also qemu side work (according to haxm dev), so I raise this for qemu side fix;

update:
according to haxm dev, they will submit a patch for qemu side of work;


Fix has been included here:
