Cannot use usb-host on Mac OS

Usb-host will not work on Mac OS 10.15.  Qemu runs, though it gives these errors and the drive does not show up.  Also, when Qemu is starting the drive ejects and remounts twice. Qemu built with ./configure --target-list=i386-softmmu,x86_64-softmmu --enable-sdl --disable-cocoa --enable-sdl-image.

Have you tried running QEMU under root yet? I had a similar issue with
accessing the optical drive on my computer until I ran QEMU like this:

sudo qemu-system-i386 ...


Yes, I tried running as root.  I also tried it on a different computer that is running Mac OS 10.13, and it gave the same errors.

Try this. Unplug the USB device. Plug it back in, and as fast as you can start QEMU. 

My theory is another program might be using the device. This could be Spotlight trying to index the drive.

Another possibility is libusb is not compatible with Mac OS 10.13 yet.

Do you have another computer that runs Mac OS 10.12 or under that you can test on?




I am also having problems with using real USB devices. I tried a C-Media USB sound card, a CISCO USB headset, and a PNY flash drive. All of them seem to be detected by the Windows 7 guest, but can't be started for some reason. I have tried running as root. I didn't see any libusb errors. My Windows 2000 guest also has issues with starting the USB sound card. 

My command-line:
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -hda "Windows 7 HD.qcow2" -boot "c" -m 5000 -device ich9-usb-ehci1 -device usb-host,vendorid=0x0930,productid=0x6545

Even when I unmount the flash drive first Mac OS 11.1 will actually mount the flash drive when I try using it in QEMU.

Hi John,

I experience similar issues when passing through USB devices in
qemu-system-ppc. macOS load a kext for the device and will not unload
it when libusb tries to connect to the device. I wrote this on the
emaculation site:

For USB storage devices you might need to:
Run a terminal and execute: sudo kextunload
/System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageDriver.kext

Other devices might be using other kexts (drivers), so you would need
to find out which kext is loaded for the device. Some devices might be
using a kext that is also in use for other host devices. If you unload
such a kext, the host will loose access to those devices.

I have not yet found a way to reliably find which kexts are loaded and
to unload them.

Best,
Howard
