qemu monitor does not suppot rbd "savevm" command

1. I used ceph rbd as my block device, /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=rbd,file=rbd:rbd/sles.img:rbd_cache=true,cache=writeback -boot c  -m 1024 -enable-kvm -vnc 0.0.0.0:0 -monitor stdio

2. when in monitor command line "savevm", it reports "Error -95 while writing VM" in the monitor

Triaging old bug tickets... has this ever been fixed? Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
