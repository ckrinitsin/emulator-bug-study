Good catch, thanks stefanha for your kindly reminds with such good tools (git-bisect) to determine which commit caused this problem. I'm very sorry that i did not try it as your instruction timely, mainly that i focus on the openstack(nova&cinder) currently in the new company and have to adapt to the new work flow & role as quickly as possible. According to me trying that 05e514b1d4d5bd4209e2c8bbc76ff05c85a235f3 is the first bad commit pushed by pbonzini.

commit 05e514b1d4d5bd4209e2c8bbc76ff05c85a235f3
Author: Paolo Bonzini <email address hidden>
Date:   Tue Jul 21 16:07:53 2015 +0200

    AioContext: optimize clearing the EventNotifier
    
    It is pretty rare for aio_notify to actually set the EventNotifier.  It
    can happen with worker threads such as thread-pool.c's, but otherwise it
    should never be set thanks to the ctx->notify_me optimization.  The
    previous patch, unfortunately, added an unconditional call to
    event_notifier_test_and_clear; now add a userspace fast path that
    avoids the call.
    
    Note that it is not possible to do the same with event_notifier_set;
    it would break, as proved (again) by the included formal model.
    
    This patch survived over 3000 reboots on aarch64 KVM.

We are hitting this bug as well. With Ceph storage back end running in OpenStack environment.

Ubuntu 14.04 
Kernel - 3.13.0-52-generic
Qemu: QEMU emulator version 2.0.0 (Debian 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.11)

Please provide a workaround or solution or if a patch is being worked on.

Thank you,

Arghya

Please try removing the "notified = true;" line from main-loop.c's os_host_main_loop_wait, and see if the warning comes out forever or just a few times.

I have experienced this behavior (main-loop: WARNING: I/O thread spun for 1000 iterations) and the resulting degraded performance.  The VM becomes very unresponsive but eventually recovers.  My setup:

Ubuntu 15.10 | qemu-system-x86_64 --version  QEMU emulator version 2.3.0 (Debian 1:2.3+dfsg-5ubuntu9)
HW = Dell Precision M6600 with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU

I agree with other comments that it seems related to high disk I/O as the problem seems to occur during VM install or other VM operations which read/write large amounts of data.

Count me in: Windows 10 Pro 64 November 2015 update is totally unusable because of this bug.

Some people say their VM recovers over time but mine doesn't apparently - I've been waiting for 15 minutes and the QEmu window is just dead.

I see the same with a Windows 10 guest on a Gentoo host. I tried setting nonblocking = 0; in vl.c as https://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2015/11/20/qemu-main-loop-warning-io-thread-spun-for-1000-iterations/ suggests, but that didn't solve the problem for me: the message is still there.

I experience the same while running Minix guest under an Arch Linux host. Sometimes during heavy I/O the whole machine freezes with this error message.

The command used is: qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=../minix-img/minix_work.img -net user,hostfwd=tcp::22222-:22 -net nic,model=virtio -m 1024M 
qemu 1.8.0 in this case, I'll test against 1.8.1 when it gets into the repos.

Apparently, the solution is: https://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2015/11/20/qemu-main-loop-warning-io-thread-spun-for-1000-iterations/

I haven't experienced the hang within a couple of days, it's fairly irregular for me to reproduce it.

I think that's a workaround, not a fix for whatever the underlying bug is.


http://gnats.netbsd.org/52184 looks like it may be related.


I no longer see the "WARNING: I/O thread spun for 1000 iterations" message.  A bisection showed that it disappeared with the following commit:

    main-loop: remove now unnecessary optimization

    This optimization is not necessary anymore, because the vCPU now drops
    the I/O thread lock even with TCG.  Drop it to simplify the code and
    avoid the "I/O thread spun for 1000 iterations" warning.

The amount of system time consumed by the qemu process, which had incrased 300-fold with commit 05e514b1d4d5bd4209e2c8bbc76ff05c85a235f3, is also back to normal.



Nice, thanks for the update.
I checked a few recent logs and agree that the message is gone since 2.9

Some might still encounter slow guests (for other reasons) and trigger the message, but the most common TCG emulation case is solved by this since Artful and later.

I think we don't want to backport all the prereqs (I/O thread locking changes) to Xenial that allow to add this change here.

Updated the Ubuntu tasks on this bug, leaving the qemu state to a triager of the project.

Ok, closing this for upstream, too, according to the previous comments.

I see the same issue with qemu version 2.5.0 (Debian 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.31).
