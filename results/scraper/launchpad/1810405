source tarball has errors when untarring

If you download qemu-2.10.0.tar.xv and/or qemu-2.10.1.tar.xv, and follow the directions at https://www.qemu.org/download/, you get a tar error.


To repro:
$ wget  https://download.qemu.org/qemu-2.10.0.tar.xz
$ tar  xJf qemu-2.10.0.tar.xz 
tar: qemu-2.10.0/roms/u-boot/scripts/Kconfig: Cannot open: File exists
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors

$ tar --version

Apologies if I'm being an idiot here.

I look in my crystal ball and deduce that you're doing this on a filesystem which isn't case-sensitive. This is bug #1714750, and it's really an issue with the u-boot code that we ship a copy of. You can work around it by extracting the sources with "tar xf qemu-2.10.0.tar.xz --exclude qemu-2.10.0/roms/u-boot/scripts/Kconfig" (the file that is excluded isn't needed to build QEMU).

It looks like we never finished the fix for 1714750 -- it's fixed in upstream u-boot but we need to move forward to using that u-boot rather than the one we currently ship.


Your crystal ball is correct! I was untarring in a Linux vbox, and was blindly assuming since it was on linux it was case sensitive. However, it was on a vboxsf shared with OSX, and apple's file system is case insensitive. Thanks so much for the rapid and nice response.
