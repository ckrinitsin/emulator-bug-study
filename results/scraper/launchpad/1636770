mouse wheel works only with -usbdevice tablet

2.7.0

tested with windows 10

As a test I tried using the wheel mouse on Mac OS 10.4 running in qemu-system-ppc. Scrolling sort of works. It also causes the mouse pointer to move up or down. That is definitely some kind of error. 

Where the problem could be:
Guest operating system
USB mouse emulation
Front-end

I'm going to rule out "Guest operating system". I think it could be the emulated USB mouse or the front-end. Maybe even a combination of the two. 

I tried using Windows in QEMU and oddly enough both Windows XP and Windows 2000 did not have a working mouse. Both guests had "-usb -device usb-mouse" in their QEMU command-line. Using usb_del to remove the USB mouse made the mouse in the guest work again. The scroll wheel did work. WordPad's window did scroll, but the mouse pointer also moved up and down just like in Mac OS 10.4. Just to note I am using the Cocoa front-end. I'm guessing you are using SDL. 

The emulated mouse does need some fixing.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
