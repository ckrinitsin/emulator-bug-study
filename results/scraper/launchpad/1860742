xv6 Bootloop

Qemu Version: 4.2.0

Launch command: 
qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -drive file=fs.img,index=1,media=disk,format=raw -drive file=xv6.img,index=0,media=disk,format=raw -smp 2 -m 512

How to reproduce? 
1.)  Use/install latest release of qemu (4.2.0 at time of writing)

2.)  Download, build, and run xv6 (a simple os designed for learning operating systems fundamentals)

cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git
cd xv6-public
make qemu-nox

3.)  Qemu should now bootloop (seem to try to boot but then just repeat). This is what it looks like below before it repeats:

SeaBIOS (version ?-20191223_100556-anatol)

iPXE (http://ipxe.org) 00:03.0 CA00 PCI2.10 PnP PMM+1FF92A50+1FEF2A50 CA00
                                                                               
Booting from Hard Disk..



Host: Arch Linux - Kernel version: 5.4.13
Guest: xv6 (https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public)

Suspicion:

When I was using qemu 2.11.1 inside docker, the xv6 os booted with no problem. I am thinking that something changed between Qemu 2.11.1 and Qemu 4.2.0 which is now causing boot problems.

Also in my ubuntu 19.10 system.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


Still seems to be an issue for me.

Qemu Version 5.2.0
Arch Linux 5.11.16-arch1-1


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
