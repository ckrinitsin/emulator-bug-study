Deadlock when detaching network interface

[Impact]
Qemu guests hang indefinitely

[Description]
When running a Qemu guest with VirtIO network interfaces, detaching an interface that's currently being used can result in a deadlock. The guest instance will hang and become unresponsive to commands, and the only option is to kill -9 the instance.
The reason for this is a dealock between a monitor and an RCU thread, which will fight over the BQL (qemu_global_mutex) and the critical RCU section locks. The monitor thread will acquire the BQL for detaching the network interface, and fire up a helper thread to deal with detaching the network adapter. That new thread needs to wait on the RCU thread to complete the deletion, but the RCU thread wants the BQL to commit its transactions.
This bug is already fixed upstream (73c6e4013b4c rcu: completely disable pthread_atfork callbacks as soon as possible) and included for other series (see below), so we don't need to backport it to Bionic onwards.

[Test Case]
Being a racing condition, this is a tricky bug to reproduce consistently. We've had reports of users running into this with OpenStack deployments and Windows Server guests, and the scenario is usually like this:
1) Deploy a 16vCPU Windows Server 2012 R2 guest with a virtio network interface
2) Stress the network interface with e.g. Windows HLK test suite or similar
3) Repeatedly attach/detach the network adapter that's in use
It usually takes more than ~4000 attach/detach cycles to trigger the bug.

[Regression Potential]
Regressions for this might arise from the fact that the fix changes RCU lock code. Since this patch has been upstream and in other series for a while, it's unlikely that it would regressions in RCU code specifically. Other code that makes use of the RCU locks (MMIO and some monitor events) will be thoroughly tested for any regressions with autokpkgtest and scripted Qemu runs.



Patch v2:
Added missing DEP3 info and corrected pkg version



Ok, for such complicated-to-reproduce issues I can understand it might be hard to actually perform verification. In this case besides running the listed test case (which might or might not actually trigger the problem), could you also do some additional smoketesting/dogfooding of the package once it's in -proposed to make sure we didn't regress? (things like running it with different guests and playing around) Thanks!

Hello Heitor, or anyone else affected,

Accepted qemu into xenial-proposed. The package will build now and be available at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.35 in a few hours, and then in the -proposed repository.

Please help us by testing this new package.  See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed for documentation on how to enable and use -proposed.  Your feedback will aid us getting this update out to other Ubuntu users.

If this package fixes the bug for you, please add a comment to this bug, mentioning the version of the package you tested and change the tag from verification-needed-xenial to verification-done-xenial. If it does not fix the bug for you, please add a comment stating that, and change the tag to verification-failed-xenial. In either case, without details of your testing we will not be able to proceed.

Further information regarding the verification process can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/PerformingSRUVerification .  Thank you in advance for helping!

N.B. The updated package will be released to -updates after the bug(s) fixed by this package have been verified and the package has been in -proposed for a minimum of 7 days.

Hi,

As this bug is very hard to trigger, I've been running some tests with qemu
1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.35 to see if we didn't regress or break anything with the
new patch. My test setup is as follows:

1) Create new QEMU guest with uvt-kvm or virt-install
    # uvt-kvm create xenial release=xenial --cpu 8
2) Install iperf and latest stress-ng from git. Upstream stress-ng is desired to have a consistent load on each guest
    # apt install iperf
    # git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/cking/stress-ng
    # cd stress-ng
    # make clean
    # make
3) Start an iperf server instance on the host
    root@host:~# iperf -s
4) Stress the guest instance with the iperf-retry.sh script and stress-ng (run those commands in different screen windows)
    # ./stress-ng --cpu 4 --hdd 4 --io 4 --vm 4
    # ./stress-ng --class network --all 2
    # ./iperf-retry.sh
5) Attach and detach network adapter using the hotplug.sh script
    root@host:~# ./hotplug.sh xenial 52:54:00:19:7a:21

I've tested this with different guests, including Xenial, Bionic and Disco.
Guest instances performed more than ~2000 hotplug cycles each:
    root@host:~# ./hotplug.sh xenial 52:54:00:19:7a:21
    Detach #1
    Interface detached successfully
    
    Detach #2
    Interface detached successfully
    
    ...
    Detach #2168
    Interface detached successfully

The QEMU guests work correctly through and after the tests, and it doesn't
look like we ran into any regressions due to the RCU patch.

Thanks,
Heitor






Thanks, this should be enough in that case. Releasing.

We don't have qemu in the rocky cloud archive so this is fixed via bionic.

The Stein cloud archive has qemu 1:3.1+dfsg-2ubuntu3~cloud0 which corresponds to the current version in disco, so I'm marking this as fix released for Stein.

I've just accepted qemu version 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.12~cloud0 into queens-proposed however the changelog doesn't mention (LP: #1818880) anywhere. Seeing that bionic is marked as fix released I assume queens can be marked as fix released.

Heiter, please if fixes are needed for ocata or pike can you provide us with patches? We need to be careful not to skip cloud archive releases (ie. if this is fixed in xenial but not the ocata and pike cloud archive).

@corey.bryant I just spoke to @halves and he said that the series targets above Bionic are an oversight since this patch landed in anything newer than 2.11 (i.e. bionic version). We do also need this for Trusty-Mitaka though so I have added that as a UCA target. I'll let @halves reply about O/P.

@@corey.bryant I've checked Pike and it has the fix included already, so I'm attaching a debdiff for Ocata only.

@hopem About Trusty-Mitaka, it seems that it automatically pulled the patch from Xenial's release so it looks good too.
