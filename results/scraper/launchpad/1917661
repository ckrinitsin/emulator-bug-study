qemu gdb wrong registers group for riscv64

Step to reproduce:
1. run qemu-system-riscv64 in gdb mode
2. attach gdb
3. set a breakpoint and run
4. print register-groups using "maintenance print register-groups" command

...
 sbadaddr   4162 4162   1628       8 long            all,general
 msounteren 4163 4163   1636       8 long            all,general
 mbadaddr   4164 4164   1644       8 long            all,general
 htimedeltah 4165 4165   1652       8 long            all,general

These registers don't belong to general group, instead they belong to all, system and csr groups.

I forgot to specify the version, I built qemu sha c40ae5a3ee387b13116948cbfe7824f03311db7e

$ qemu-system-riscv64 --version
QEMU emulator version 5.2.50 (v5.2.0-2392-gc40ae5a3ee-dirty)


The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
