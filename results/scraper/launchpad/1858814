'make -C roms efi' does not update edk2 submodules

On a fresh clone, 'make -C roms efi' fails because submodule is not initialized [1]:

/builds/philmd/qemu/roms/edk2/CryptoPkg/Library/OpensslLib/OpensslLibCrypto.inf(-1): error 000E: File/directory not found in workspace
/builds/philmd/qemu/roms/edk2/CryptoPkg/Library/OpensslLib/openssl/e_os.h
- Failed -

Laszlo suggested [2] it is possibly a regression from commit f3e330e3c319:
"roms/Makefile.edk2: don't pull in submodules when building from tarball"

Symptom persists as of v5.1.0, but I don't think it really matters. We should close the ticket as wontfix.

There might be a big buildsys change in QEMU if we switch to Meson,
so I'm waiting for that to happen first and then update this ticket.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
