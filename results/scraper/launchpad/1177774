The QEMU Gtk+ frontend fails to build..

With the 1.5 release so near does no one really care that the Gtk+ frontend does not build? I would think this would be a pretty important bug to fix before the release.

Sending a patch soon, please reply with Tested-by if it works.

For *BSD OS's you have to include termios.h..

e.g.

#if defined(__GLIBC__)
# include <pty.h>
#elif defined CONFIG_BSD
# include <termios.h>
# if defined(__FreeBSD__) || defined(__FreeBSD_kernel__) || defined(__DragonFly__)
#  include <libutil.h>
# else
#  include <util.h>
# endif
#elif defined CONFIG_SOLARIS
# include <stropts.h>
#endif

This should allow OS X to at least build. It looks like Solaris does not have openpty() and cfmakeraw()

So the *BSD build has been fixed, but someone needs to look into fixing the Gtk+ backend on Solaris.

Looks like this issue has been fixed by this commit here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=4efeabbbe8441cc327052304
... so I think it should be OK to close this now.
