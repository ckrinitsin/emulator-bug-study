Fails to start on Windows host without explicit --disable-pie

Since commit d2cd29e30736afd4a1e8cac3cf4da360bbc65978, which removed the x86 conditional around PIE, QEMU completely fails to start on a Windows host unless --disable-pie is explicitly given at build time. Even just requesting the help text doesn't work. To make testing easier, this can be replicated with Wine.

What compiler and toolchain are you using?

I'm using GCC 9.3.0 with mingw-w64 7.0.0, all built with Gentoo Linux's crossdev. 

I didn't know whether PIE is generally supported on Windows or not. It was possible that Gentoo is just inadvertently disabling support for it. It did stem from a bug report though and reading around, others elsewhere have reported that PIE on Windows doesn't work.

It seems on some compilers the test can pass but still give you
broken binaries.
