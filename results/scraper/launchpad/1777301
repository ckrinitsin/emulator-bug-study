Boot failed after installing Checkpoint Pointsec FDE

Boot failed after installing Checkpoint Pointsec FDE


Hi,
I installed Windows 10 64-bit guest on CentOS 7. Everything works great as expected.
However after installing CheckPoint AlertSec full disk encryption, the guest failed to boot.

The following error is displayed in qemu log file.
KVM internal error. Suberror: 1
emulation failure

Please also check attached logs. I am new to qemu-kvm so please don't hesitate to ask missing info.



The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
