Password for firebird 3.0
-------------------------

Firebird has a special user named SYSDBA, which is the user that has access to all databases. SYSDBA can also create new databases and users. Because of this, it is
necessary to secure SYSDBA with a password.

The password is stored in /etc/firebird/3.0/SYSDBA.password (readable only by root). You may modify it there (don't forget to update the security database too, using the
gsec utility), or you may use dpkg-reconfigure to update both.

If you don't enter a password, a random one will be used (and stored in SYSDBA.password).

Password for SYSDBA: 

adduser: Warning: The home directory `/var/lib/firebird' does not belong to the user you are currently creating.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
