[feature request] HP300 m68k system?

QEMU seems to support nothing (specific) that 4.4BSD was targeted to...would be useful to have a complete emulator for a full HP300 to run the binary dist from McKusick's CD set.

Devices that'd be needed: 
* 68020, 68030, or 68040 (How much of these are already present? Not sure if there was a non-standard MMU/FPU...but there was definitely a slightly-uncommon bus used for some peripherals)
* Networking was lance I am pretty sure...at least the onboard one.
* SCSI (Probably a standard chip as used EVERYWHERE ELSE..not sure off hand)
* Framebuffers optional, serial is sufficient for basic booting of 4.4.

Tape/disk can also be done via HP-IB...but SCSI would probably be easier unless extra peripherals were required (some serial stuff.)

I'm not aware of anybody from the QEMU community working on emulating such 68k system ... so if you want support for that, you likely have to write the patches on your own... Anyway, you might want to have a look at Laurent Vivier's 68k tree - it features full 680x0 emulation (i.e. not only ColdFire) already: https://github.com/vivier/qemu-m68k

I have Quadra 800 system emulation in the branch q800-v2.4.0.

You can create a bootable disk image following this wiki:

https://github.com/vivier/qemu-m68k/wiki

But this is not fully functional: fork() doesn't work well...

You can also find a working image from:

http://landley.net/aboriginal/

This image works better as it is based on busybox and uClibc
(the fork() bug is triggered by the lazy symbol resolution mode of glibc)
