Cirrus video, graphical corruption, bad fonts

The error
===

I started qemu by

`shell
$ ./qemu-system-i386 -serial stdio -cdrom /dev/cdrom -vga cirrus
S1111111111S1111111111S1111111111S1111111111â–’*n*n*n*n
`

with the original suse7.0 cd 1 in the cdrom drive (I think https://archive.org/details/suse-7.0_release_i386 has the image). After some console output (that uses a vga framebuffer which seems to work fine) the suse installer is started. It is displayed mostly correct, but several text passages are completely garbled.

I noticed the same type of corruption when trying to run an old XF86 SVGA Server on a SuSE 6.2 System using the `-vga cirrus` option.

Therefore I think that the cirrus emulation might not work as intended any more.

Qemu version
===

I used  qemu-w64-setup-20180815.exe provided by https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/

./qemu-system-i386 -version
QEMU emulator version 3.0.0 (v3.0.0-11723-ge2ddcc5879-dirty)

Hope you can fix it. 

Best regards!



Here's what Suse62 does.

I started this system by

uli_r@DESKTOP-I4GHL3R /cygdrive/h/programme/qemu
$ ./qemu-system-i386 -serial stdio -hda suse62.ima -vga cirrus
WARNING: Image format was not specified for 'suse62.ima' and probing guessed raw.
         Automatically detecting the format is dangerous for raw images, write operations on block 0 will be restricted.
         Specify the 'raw' format explicitly to remove the restrictions.

I configured X using the old sax (Suse Advanced X-Configurator) to use the SVGA server. Video memory is autodetected at only 64k, so I manually overwrote it to be 2048k, all other values I left as autodetected. I ordered it to start up in 1024x768@16bpp.

Attached images show, what it does.

It's the same host system with the same qemu version as above...




The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

FWIW, issue has been re-opened here: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/988
