Access to /proc/self/exe in linux-user mode

This is based on a recent bug in GCC Bugzilla: http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60681

It looks like libbacktrace (GCC runtime library used for obtaining stack traces) uses /proc/self/exe for error reporting. Currently this is mapped to qemu-arm which effectively disables libbacktrace on linux-user.

It seems that QEMU already supports /proc/self/{maps,stat,auxv} so addition of /proc/self/exe may be trivial.

This tiny patch seems to work.

I think the problem is not in libbacktrace per se but rather libsanitizer initializing libbacktrace with contents of /proc/self/exe. Patch is still relevant though.

Looks good, I'll get this to linux-user que once QEMU 2.0 is released.

That patch will copy the whole of the target executable into a temporary file without changing any of it -- the fake_open mechanism is really intended for cases where we need to return modified results. Wouldn't it be easier to just have something in do_open() that said:
    if (is_proc_myself(pathname, "exe")) {
        return get_errno(open(exec_path), flags, mode);
    }

That will then give the right behaviour for read-only executables and other error-related corner cases.

(See also the logic in the readlink/readlinkat handling which already specialcases /proc/self/exe using exec_path.)


(I got the bracket placement wrong there so as you can tell the code is untested :-))


Yes, it works. Here is updated patch.

Some nits:
 The "(CPUArchState *)" cast isn't necessary
 We should use exec_path, not ts->bprm->argv[0] (the guest argv[0] isn't necessarily the executable path)
 We don't want to call path() here -- exec_path is a host path, and only guest filename paths need to go through path().

Looking a little more closely at the logic in main.c I wonder if we actually want:

   if (is_proc_myself(pathname, "exe")) {
        execfd = qemu_getauxval(AT_EXECFD);
        if (execfd) {
             return execfd;
        }
        return get_errno(open(exec_path, flags, mode));
    }

Also if you'd like us to apply your patches we'll need at least a "Signed-off-by: " line from you.


Ok, fixed.

Thanks. That version

Hi,

Is this patch deployed in new version of QEMU?

Thanks,
Maxim

This bug was fixed by commit aa07f5ecf9828 in 2014 and has been released in QEMU.
