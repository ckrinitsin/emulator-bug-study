How to Migration VM Built on Qemu Souce Code Installation

Respected all,

I followed https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/Linux to build qemu from source code. Its installed successfully with Ubuntu 16.04 VM created using VNC server.

Now, Could you please suggest me how to migrate VM from one host to another?.
