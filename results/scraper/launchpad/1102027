QED Time travel

This night after a reboot of a VM, it was back to 8 Oct. 2012, i've lost all data between 8 Oct 2012 and now. I've check the QED file and mount on another VM, all seems OK.

This QED has a raw backfile with the base OS (debian) shared with many others QED. It has NO snapshot.

QEMU emulator version 1.1.2

Does anyone have a hint ?

Hi Mekza,
Are you able to reproduce this issue or did this happen once only?

Does "all seems OK" mean that you still only saw the files from 8 Oct
2012 when you attached the image to another VM?

There's not a lot of information here to go by.  If the issue is
reproducible it should be possible to collect more information, starting
with the steps to reproduce the issue.

Hi Stefan,

I already had this bug once and after a unmeasurable period (days or even
weeks) and a reboot of the VM, the FS was back.

"all seems OK" means the QED file is not corrupted and consistent. I still
have files from 8 Oct 2012.

I know, i'm gonna copy the QED and then convert to RAW and attach it to a
new VM. I'll keep you in touch.
