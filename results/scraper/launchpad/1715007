hw/block/onenand.c:520: dead code ?

qemu/hw/block/onenand.c:520] -> [qemu/hw/block/onenand.c:521]: (warning) Opposite inner 'if' condition leads to a dead code block.

Source code is

        for (b = 0; b < s->blocks; b ++) {
            if (b >= s->blocks) {
                s->status |= ONEN_ERR_CMD;
                break;
            }

I am not sure if the if condition can be merely deleted, or something more
complex needs to be implemented.

Recent qemu trunk.

Fix has now been included here:
