Ability to use -net socket with unix sockets

It would be a nice feature (simplifying access control for example) to be able to do something like:

qemu -net socket,listen=unix:/tmp/qemunet
qemu -net socket,connect=unix:/tmp/qemunet

For now one has to use TCP connections even for guests running on the same host, which involves setting up iptables to restrict access.

Aren't these at different levels of the stack? Network devices deal in packets not connections. It sounds like you want to use something like vsock which provides a virtual socket device to the guest.

This is just about connecting the NIC backends for 2 QEMUs together using a UNIX socket, instead of the current TCP/UDP socket. It should be fairly trivial to support i would expect. Though ideally we'd port the netdev socket backend to use QIOChannel  too
