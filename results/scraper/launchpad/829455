user mode network stack - hostfwd not working with restrict=y

I find that explicit hostfwd commands do not seem to work with restrict=yes option, even if the docs clearly state that hostfwd should override restrict setting.

I am using this config:

-net user,name=test,net=192.168.100.0/24,host=192.168.100.44,restrict=y,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:3389-192.168.100.1:3389

(my guest has static IP address configured as 192.168.100.1/24)

and I cannot log into my guest via rdp. the client hanging indefinitely.
by just changing to "restrict=no" I can log in.

maybe I am doing something wrong, but I cannot figure out what.

running QEMU emulator version 0.14.0 (qemu-kvm-0.14.0)

Did you guys merge back the fix in:

?
