qemu 2.7.x 2.8 softmmu dont work on BE machine 

Build on Be machine qemu 2.7.1 and 2.8 in pure softmmu (tgc) dont work on big endian hardware .
tested with ppc-softmmu,i386-softmmu,arm-softmmu same result:

with :
 ./qemu-system-i386 
Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "overlay-scrollbar"
qemu-system-i386: Trying to execute code outside RAM or ROM at 0x000a0000
This usually means one of the following happened:

(1) You told QEMU to execute a kernel for the wrong machine type, and it crashed on startup (eg trying to run a raspberry pi kernel on a versatilepb QEMU machine)
(2) You didn't give QEMU a kernel or BIOS filename at all, and QEMU executed a ROM full of no-op instructions until it fell off the end
(3) Your guest kernel has a bug and crashed by jumping off into nowhere

This is almost always one of the first two, so check your command line and that you are using the right type of kernel for this machine.
If you think option (3) is likely then you can try debugging your guest with the -d debug options; in particular -d guest_errors will cause the log to include a dump of the guest register state at this point.

Execution cannot continue; stopping here.


I try to add the -L option with ../pc-bios/bios.bin 
and have the same result.

note the ppc-softmmu and ppc64-softmmu work in kvm mode only emulated mode have issue.


tested on my hardware a  Qriq P5040 and G5 4x970MP with Ubuntu Mate 16.10 
thanks

I can not reproduce this issue. QEMU 2.8 works fine here on a POWER8 big endian host (running RHEL7). Can you still run older versions of QEMU that used to work for you in the past, to check whether it is QEMU or whether it is Ubuntu 16.10 that is causing the trouble here? Could you please also post the full output of the "configure" run on your system?

Something else to try: Could you please check whether you get any output when you run "qemu-system-ppc -nographic" on your system? So we can make sure that it is not related to GTK or something similar...

Hi Thomas,
here the configure .. i made a clean one just with the target for have fastest build 
will report soon the result with the nographic just the time of build

i386-softmmu:
./qemu-system-i386 -nographic
qemu-system-i386: Trying to execute code outside RAM or ROM at 0x000a0000
This usually means one of the following happened: and so and so 

./qemu-system-ppc -nographic 
nothing happen ... no exit on console .


on 2.6.2 i have:

qemu-system-ppc -nographic

note the 2.6.2 work, before on 2.6.1 i had the same issue of 2.7 and 2.8

I can reproduce the same problem on 2.7.0 on a PowerPC G5 for the x86, x86_64 and ppc softmmu targets (minus the Gtk problem, since I use this ported to Cocoa). As with Luigi this seems to be a regression from 2.6.2. There is no change with -nographic.

The commenter indicates several BE issues were detected. I have not yet heard from him regarding his patches or whether they were upstreamed here.

Oh my gosh the great Cameron Kaiser :) 

Looking through old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce the issue with the latest version of QEMU (v4.2) and a more recent Linux distribution?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
