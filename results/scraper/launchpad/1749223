mouse offset or invisible wall 2.11.0-3 

(There was another post, I'm not sure if it is related though. Also not sure if it's Arch related, I wouldn't be surprised as I normally use Gentoo and have less problems with Gentoo.)

When I grab the mouse in/out of the VM I tend to get an "invisible wall" half of the time.
I can push past if I fling the mouse through it but not if I slowly keep moving down.

The direction always seems to be down when I hit a wall (so a Y offset? maybe?)
This has been happening since at least version 2.10.

Not sure if "-alt-grab" has anything to do with it, that'd be my first guess.

It sounds like I have the same problem.

There is a virtual wall where the mouse cursor goes from the guest window to the host desktop.
This virtual wall/cut off point is consistent.
Moving the mouse faster seems to break through this wall and puts the wall at a different place.

For me this happens on a host with ubuntu 19.10 with wayland.
I don't have the issue on ubuntu 19.10 with X.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
