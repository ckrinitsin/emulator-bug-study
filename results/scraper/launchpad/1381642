ecovec.c:66: buffer too small by one.

[qemu-2.1.2/roms/u-boot/board/renesas/ecovec/ecovec.c:66]: (error) Buffer is accessed out of bounds.

    sprintf(env_mac, "%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X",
        mac[0], mac[1], mac[2], mac[3], mac[4], mac[5]);

but

    char env_mac[17];

and 18 into 17 won't go. Suggest increase size of env_mac.

This is in the u-boot code which we just carry a copy of
to produce certain boot ROMs. You should report these
issues directly to u-boot upstream.

FWIW, u-boot was apparently fixed here:
http://git.denx.de/?p=u-boot.git;a=commitdiff;h=44442c13ba2f63a67664ab5

...and we don't build u-boot for the renesas ecovec, so we don't need to worry about updating our copy of u-boot to something with the fix in it.
