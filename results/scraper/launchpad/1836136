u-boot: any plans to update u-boot to v2019.07

Just want to pulse about the plan to update u-boot binary to latest v2019.07.

Are there any notable bugfixes or new features that this would get us for the two platforms where we ship a u-boot binary ?

As it happens, in April 2021 commit 335b6389374a53e0 bumped our u-boot rom to v2021.04 to fix a PCI issue.
