qemu runas and sandbox option incompatible, process will hang in futex after setgid

With -runas [user] and -sandbox on, qemu process will fail in the process of dropping privileges. While setgid() is done (see below), setuid() is not attempted. Instead process blocks waiting for a futex never to come.

Yes, it looks like that discussion is related. Though I also got the impression that there is currently still some decision going on how exactly to fix this. So it feels like we should wait with any fix until this decision is made (and a fix is committed into qemu's upstream repo)...

hmm, the change still did not made it upstream.
I lost track on it and only see it now checking bugs that became dormant - was that fixed in another way?

There is some overlap with LP: #1675114 so you might be interested to know that @otubo is working on refactoring seccomp for upstream. No firm ETA yet but he thinks that 18.04 would be doable.

I haven't tried, but I think this should be fixed now with the new elevateprivileges parameter of the -sandbox option. Have you tried to reproduce the problem with the latest version of QEMU already?
