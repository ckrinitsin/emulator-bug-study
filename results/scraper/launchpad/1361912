qemu-mips64 Segmentation fault

When I ran qemu-mips64 for any mips 64 executable , I got this error:

$ ./qemu-mips64  ../lang
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Is this a known issue?

Could you please provide backtrace and give more details to reproduce the issue?

This is a error in user mode, I think it should be very easy to reproduce.

I forgot to add that qemu-mips64 works for me, that's why I asked for the details to reproduce the issue (i.e. what is "lang", what tools you used to build it, command line etc.)

I can see the problem with any simple program:
1. cat t.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  printf("Hello QEMU.\n");
}

2. mips64-gcc -static t.c -o t
3. qemu-mips64 t
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

I built QEMU on Ubuntu 12.04 with the system GCC compiler, and the commands are:
./configure --enable-linux-user
make


I've just checked with current head-of-git QEMU and we can execute the attached mips executable OK, so we've clearly fixed this bug at some point in the last three years. Closing as fix-committed, since the fix will definitely be in 2.11, though it's quite likely that 2.10 would also work.
