sys_eeprom.c:353: buffer too small

[qemu-2.1.2/roms/u-boot/board/matrix_vision/mvblx/sys_eeprom.c:353]: (error) Buffer is accessed out of bounds.

        char ethaddr[9];

        sprintf(ethaddr, "%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X",
            e.mac[0],
            e.mac[1],
            e.mac[2],
            e.mac[3],
            e.mac[4],
            e.mac[5]);

18 into 9 won't go. Suggest increase size of ethaddr.

roms/u-boot is not under control of the QEMU project - you should report such bugs to the u-boot project instead. Anyway, looks like the problem has been fixed there:
