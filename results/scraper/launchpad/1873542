Windows 98 videocard passthrough - unable to load higher resolution -Desktop, after some games crashes, without whole physical machine reset..

When you are using games which are using fullscreen switching resolutions (some old games are 640x480 or 800x600 max), videocard is often stuck after crash and whole Linux machine has to be rebooted, to fix it.. VM reboot is not enough. 

  That stuck is strange one, after restart of machine, text mode is working fine, but graphical mode should be set to higher resolution (Load Windows 98 desktop) there is only black screen and screen input blinking.

  I simulated it with multiple videocards, graphical drivers, its quite often, full Linux reboot is always safe it. Im using right roms for my cards, because otherwise i get often even boot machine twice in one Linux boot session.

  Some there is need for some better card reset.

  Also some videocard reset on Linux level workaround would be nice. 

  Simulated on Qemu 2.11 and 4.2 and Linux Mint 19.3, but my guess its whole KVM videocard passthrough problem.
