qemu s390x on focal - applications breaking

Running qemu-system-s390x (1:4.0+dfsg-0ubuntu10) on an x86-64 Focal host with an upgrade of a Eoan s390x VM to a Focal s390x is triggering random breakage, for example:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

...

And now bash is completely broken:

Floating point exception (core dumped)

The upgrade works OK on a s390x, so I'm assuming it's something to do with the qemu emulation.

I've also seen in the dmesg log:

[  287.624414] User process fault: interruption code 0007 ilc:3 in libstdc++.so.6.0.28[3ffb3e00000+21d000]

ps is showing QEMU is running as follows:

Hi Colin,
I didn't read much if the details but I think it is clear.

Per request of IBM focal got -march=z13 but tcg has no emulation for some
of the instructions of this cpu.

That is the breakage that you are seeing and afaik there is nothing we can
do than waiting for qemu to grow that support.


Can you please test again with the latest QEMU 4.2 RC? There have been quite a lot of fixes in this area in the past months, so maybe this issue has already been resolved in 4.2.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

[Expired for Ubuntu on IBM z Systems because there has been no activity for 60 days.]

FYI - Focal now contains 4.2 which might (or not) have the bits you need.
You most likely get further, but I can't give guarantees if enough of march=z13 is supported to work for a full Focal (not sure on vector instructions for example) including all of userspace.

Marking it incomplete - if someone wants to try please go for it and let us know.
Otherwise let it expire again ...

Seems like you have to set all to "incomplete" to restart the expire counter again...
