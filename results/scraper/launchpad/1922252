[feature request] webcam support

Please

I am impatient to get something as "-device usb-webcam" to share dynamically the webcam between host and guest.

Thanks

Have you already tried to simply pass the host USB webcam through to the guest? ... that's likely easier and faster than adding software emulation...

I use

-device usb-host,vendorid=0x046d,productid=0x081b

But in this case the webcam belongs to the guest and the host can't use the webcam.

I want a dynamical sharing like the mouse sharing for example.

Thanks

Ticket has been moved to the new issue tracker at GitLab (thanks!):

... so I'm closing this ticket on Launchpad now.
