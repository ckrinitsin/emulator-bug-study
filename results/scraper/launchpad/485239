Windows 2008 datacenter- 64 bit , installation fails with qemu-system-x86_64 0.11.50

Installation of Windows 2008 datacenter- 64 bit fails with qemu-system-x86_64. 
Version of qemu-system-x86_64 is 0.11.50. 
The installation source is dvd iso. Just after booting for installation of the Windows guest, it hangs for sometime and then the installation crashes with the error:

"A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer".

Below is the command used for creating the guest.
/usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom /home/en_windows_server_2008_datacenter_enterprise_standard_x64_dvd_X14-26714.iso -hda /var/lib/libvirt/images/win2008_dc_64.qcow2 -m 3000 -smp 3 -net nic -net tap,script=/home/qemu-ifup-latest -name win2008_dc_64 -vnc :1 &

Disk info of the guest image is as below:
/usr/local/bin/qemu-img info /var/lib/libvirt/images/win2008_dc_64.qcow2
image: /var/lib/libvirt/images/win2008_dc_64.qcow2
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 15G (16106127360 bytes)
disk size: 136K
cluster_size: 65536

This issue is also reproducible with raw image format.



I am experiencing similar problems with Win2008 / Win7 guests; BSOD when trying to install; sometimes before the first screen, sometimes just after.

Using Ubuntu Lucid:
kernel 2.6.32-21-server
qemu-kvm-0.12.3

Also on Fedora 12:
kernel 2.6.32.12-115.fc12.x86_64
qemu-0.11.0-13.fc12.x86_64
qemu-system-x86-0.11.0-13.fc12.x86_64

I've tried qcow2 and raw, with/without network device, cirrus/std/vmware vga... suggestions welcomed.

Please try the latest version. The version you reported is too old.
