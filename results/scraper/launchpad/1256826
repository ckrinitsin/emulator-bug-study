INT instruction bug in WindowsXP

This bug is in -no-kvm mode.

In windowsXP at IDT entry 2&8 is Task gate

when application use INT 2 or INT 8 it will cause blue screen in XP.

I found it should cause #GP not generate hw interrupt.

also I check this bug with -enable-kvm and works correctly.

Which QEMU version did you use here? Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU (currently 2.8)?
