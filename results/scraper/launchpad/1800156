windows 8.1 loose grab/leave window on windowed

Hello, i am new to QEMU and i encounter that annoying issue (windowed) when i move the mouse a bit too much then it leave the window.

Windows 8.1, Latest QEMU (Windows binaries).

Does the mouse grabbing still does not work with the latest version of QEMU? Which binaries did you use?
