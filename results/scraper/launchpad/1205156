Errors while compiling version 1.5.2

Environment: Ubuntu 13.04

"hw/ide/macio.c: In function ‘pmac_ide_atapi_transfer_cb’:

I got the source files with a "git clone git://git.qemu-project.org/qemu.git" + a recent "git fetch"

I was able to compile and link latest 1.5.2 release with the tar.bz2 source files.

I'm glad that ASAs do not crash anymore within GNS3 with this latest qemu release: nice work guys! :)

This doesn't seem to be vanilla 1.5.2, where 04dd1259 isn't applicable
(no MACIO_DPRINTF statements), but rather a newer release or past
version with this patch on top:

  commit 80fc95d8bdaf3392106b131a97ca701fd374489a
  Author: Alexander Graf <email address hidden>
  Date:   Fri Jun 28 13:30:01 2013 +0200
  
      PPC: dbdma: Support unaligned DMA access

I'd pull them both in if Alex wants to send a backported version for
1.5.2, but otherwise this doesn't seem to be an issue with stable.

I'd rather not backport these to 1.5, as the patches only make sense as a whole with an OpenBIOS update.

IIUC the compile error has been fixed for 1.6, correct?

Ok, makes sense, just thought I'd double-check. Got the impression from the bug
report that maybe some downstreams were carrying your patch on top of 1.5.2 for
OSX support, but I'm not really sure what's going on here.

Yup, should be fixed upstream with 04dd1259
