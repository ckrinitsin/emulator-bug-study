[RISCV] sfence.vma need to end the translation block

QEMU emulator version 5.0.0

sfence.vma will flush the tlb, so after this instruction, the translation block should be end. The following code will only work in single step mode:
```
relocate:
	li a0, OFFSET

	la t0, 1f
	add t0, t0, a0
	csrw stvec, t0

        la t0, early_pgtbl
	srl t0, t0, PAGE_SHIFT
	li t1, SATP_SV39
	or t0, t1, t0

        csrw satp, t0
1:
	sfence.vma
	la t0, trap_s
	csrw stvec, t0
	ret
```

In this code, I want to relocate pc to virtual address with the OFFSET prefix, before writing to satp, pc run at physic address, stvec has been set a label 1 with a virtual prefix and virtual address has been mapping in early_pgtbl, after writing satp, there will throw a page fault, and pc will set to virtual address of label 1.

The problem is that, in this situation, the translation block will not end after sfence.vma, and stvec will be set to trap_s,

So, the program will crash, and the program will work in single step mode:

```
The pc will set to label 1, instead of trap_s.

I try to patch the code in fence.i in trans_rvi.inc.c to sfence.vma:
```
    tcg_gen_movi_tl(cpu_pc, ctx->pc_succ_insn);
    exit_tb(ctx);
    ctx->base.is_jmp = DISAS_NORETURN;
```
This codes can help to end the tranlate block, since I'm not a qemu guy, I'm not sure if this is a corret method.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
