qemu core dumped by kvm-spice

Hi there,

I am trying to use kvm-spice to start the qemu virtual machines. They start fine with the /usr/ bin/kvm command, but when I use the kvm-spice command the VM will not start and the core is dumped.

Command I used: 
kvm-spice -cpu host -enable-kvm -name win-7 -m 3000 -drive file=/var/vmmachines/win-7.img -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user -localtime -usb -vga qxl -global qxl-vga.vram_size=67108864 -spice port=5901,disable-ticketing -boot d


Response:
do_spice_init: starting 0.10.1
spice_server_add_interface: SPICE_INTERFACE_MIGRATION
spice_server_add_interface: SPICE_INTERFACE_KEYBOARD
spice_server_add_interface: SPICE_INTERFACE_MOUSE

Aborted (core dumped)


I am running Ubuntu 12.04 sserver for this. Any information about this issue would be appreciated, i'm stuck on this one.

Kind regards, 
Tom

Hi,

I can't reproduce this on either precise or quantal with the stock packages.  

Does it crash before starting to boot windows?

Can you try installing the qemu-linaro-dbgsym package (per https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash) and re-run to get a stack trace?

Sorry, that debug package would be called qemu-kvm-spice-dbgsym.

Hey Serge, thanks for your response.

Running the debug module like you asked me to, the attached text file was generated.

About the crashing before booting Windows: I have no idea. It starts the VM for about one or two seconds, then dumps the core and kills the VM. I'd like to point out it kills the VM with any OS, not just Windows 7. I've tried this with Ubuntu 12.04 (client and server), Windows XP and I think I also tried it with Windows 2k8 R2. It just crashes the VM if I start it this way. 

The way I am using it now is by using the /usr/bin/kvm command. The way I installed the server was by using this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~bderzhavets/+archive/lib-usbredir81

Hope you can help,
Tom

@Tom,

you are running an experimental PPA containing unstable usb redirection code.
Your best bets are to (a) try with the quantal or upstream package, (b)
if you don't really need the experimental usb redirection, use the precise
packages, or (c) contact the owner of the PPA.  Qemu 1.1  (which is in that
PPA) was rather buggy compared to 1.2 (which is upstream and in quantal),
so it would seem worthwhile for the PPA owner to upload a newer version.


@ Serge,

Ah oke, I was not aware of the big version issues. But as Quantal is not officially released yet and only RC's are out, won't that cause issues?
All I am trying to do is get a working demo of the capabilities of the Spice protocol but many of the how-to's and PPA's are heavely out of date / support. Would you have any advice, as manyally building the protocol isn't working for me

Cheers for the quick responses.

I'm not sure what you mean by issues - bugs reported against Q will
definately be addressed.  The qemu versions in Q are basically set
in stone.  If you need features added, then indeed that won't happen
in Q at this point.

What do you mean by manually building the protocol?  

In Q, I've been doing:

sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm-spice
qemu-img create spice.img 10G
kvm-spice -cpu host -enable-kvm -m 1024 -M pc-1.2 -drive file=spice.img,if=virtio,cache=none -vga qxl -spice port=5900,disable-ticketing

(except also using tap bridged to eth0)

It's worked great for ubuntu quantal and fedora 18 guests.


Oeh boy, do I like feeling like an idiot :) Thanks a lot for that easy way to do it... the guides on forums and the spice-space.org page make it look way more difficult than it needs to be. Big love to you man!

Regards, Tom
