Perfctr MSRs not available to Guest OS on AMD Phenom II

The  AMD Phenom(tm) II X4 965 Processor (family 16, model 4, stepping 3) has the 4 architecturally supported perf counters at MSRs.  The selectors are c001000-c001003, and the counters are c001004-c001007.  I've verified that the MSRs are there and working by manually setting the MSRs with msr-tools to count cycles.

The processor does not support the extended perfctr or the perfctr_nb.  These are in cpuid leaf 8000_0001.  Qemu also sees that these cpuid flags are not set, when I try launching with  -cpu host,perfctr_core,check.  However, this flag is only for the extended perfctr MSRs, which also happen to map the original four counters at c0010200.

When I run a Guest OS, that OS is unable to use the perf counter registers from c001000-7.  rdmsr and wrmsr complete, but the results are always 0.  By contrast, a wrmsr to one of the c0010200 registers causes a general protection fault (as it should, since those aren't supported).

thanks.

i don't understand this in detail, but since the last update of qemu i can't start my virtual win7 machine. i use gnome-boxes 3.24. qemu 2.8 works, 2.9 leads to this:
Preformatted text(gnome-boxes:4301): Boxes-WARNING **: machine.vala:611: Failed to start win7: Unable to start domain: the CPU is incompatible with host CPU: Host CPU does not provide required features: monitor, rdtscp, svm

i ask, because i also use an phenom 2 x4 and if this is the bug i don't need to opan a new one.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Hi -

I don't have the hardware readily available anymore, so I can't test it.  Might as well close the bug.

Regarding Oliver's question, it doesn't sound like the same issue I had.  I do recall that processor and qemu not supporting rdtscp (which is fine), so that problem might be some qemu startup script requesting features that aren't available.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
