Can't build static on ARM (Raspbian)

I am trying to build static QEMU on Raspbian, chrooted into using systemd-nspawn with QEMU 4.0.0.
This is how my compiling looks:

Just the problematic part:

How I do the compiling:
https://pastebin.com/pYM17A6R (I plan to share this tutorial when it will work)
It is a coincidence, or the build fails because it cannot find lp11-kit. I did some symlinks:
ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libp11-kit.so.0 /usr/lib/libp11-kit.so.0
ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libp11-kit.so /usr/lib/libp11-kit.so
(should I also symlink libp11.so and libp11.so.2? I think I have installed all required p11 packages!

This looks Debian specific. Not sure why you have to install the p11-kit/libp11-dev/libp11-2 packages although.

I agree with Philippe - if you have to symlink your libraries like this, it is certainly not a bug in QEMU, but a problem of your distro. So please report this issue in your distro bugtracker instead.

You might find that adding --disable-tools to your configure line also helps in not trying to statically link random binaries you don't really want.


Well, the symlinks didn't resolve the issue. I just tried them to see if this will solve the issue.

And I installed a lot of packages, blindly trying to solve this issue. Using full Raspbian instead of Raspbian Lite was also an attempt to do so. I'm just an advanced Linux user, not a developer! I will cut the list down to the necessary ones when I get it to compile!

pmaydell: Thank you a lot, it compiles successfully with --disable-tools in configure. I have one question... does it affect how QEMU static binary works in any way? I'm just curious.




No, --disable-tools won't change the qemu-* binaries that are built. It just stops us trying to build some binaries like the 'ivshmem-client' one that was causing a problem for you.
