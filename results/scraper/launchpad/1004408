BUG: Soft Lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 22s! [qemu-system-x86: 31867]

Environment:
-------------------
        * Upstream git version: qemu-kvm-1.1-rc2-4-g3fd9fed
        * Host Kernel: Mainline Kernel - 3.4.0 x86_64 GNU/Linux (Arch: x86_64)
        * CPU model: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5570  @ 2.93GHz
        * Guest OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.2 
        * Guest Kernel: 2.6.32-220.el6.x86_64
        * Qemu-command line: 
/usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -name 'vm1' -nodefaults -monitor unix:'/tmp/monitor-humanmonitor1-20120525-214210-Zua6',server,nowait -serial unix:'/tmp/serial-20120525-214210-Zua6',server,nowait -device ich9-usb-uhci1,id=usb1 -drive file='/tmp/kvm_autotest_root/images/rhel62-64.qcow2',index=0,if=ide,cache=none -device rtl8139,netdev=idvVySvg,mac='9a:6d:16:b9:b5:06',id='idiX1NmG' -netdev tap,id=idvVySvg,fd=21 -m 7198 -smp 2 -device usb-tablet,id=usb-tablet1,bus=usb1.0 -vnc :0 -vga std

The qemu is started through autotest. 

Description:
-----------------

While running the cgroup test through autotest, the host was hung and was not responding. When viewed through serial console, found the error "BUG: Soft lockup" error as attached in the screenshot 1. 

There are no errors displayed in /var/log/messages (no call trace) and in dmesg.*
There is a call trace seen in serial console, which is show in screenshot 2. 

Steps to reproduce:
----------------------------
Currently am not able to consistently reproduce this error. However when I tried to reproduce it again by running the cgroup test, found another error from syslogd as shown below

"Message from syslogd@phx3 at May 25 21:56:04 ...
  kernel:Kernel panic - not syncing: Watchdog detected hard LOCKUP on cpu 3"

So this time I got a hard Lockup error. Attached is the screenshot of the same. (screenshot-3, see the message at the bottom of the screen). This time the cgroup test had completed. 

Please let me know if you require more info on this.

Thanks for the bug report, but please report kernel bugs in the kernel bug tracker, not in the QEMU bug tracker (see http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Bugs for details). So if the problem still persists with recent kernels, you should open a ticket there instead.
