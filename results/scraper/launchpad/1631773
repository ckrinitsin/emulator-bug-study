hw/dma/pl080.c:354: possible typo ?

hw/dma/pl080.c:354:1: warning: V578 An odd bitwise operation detected: s->conf & (0x2 | 0x2). Consider verifying it.

Source code is

       if (s->conf & (PL080_CONF_M1 | PL080_CONF_M1)) {

Maybe better code

       if (s->conf & (PL080_CONF_M1 | PL080_CONF_M2)) {

Thanks for reporting the issue, patch has now been included here:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=04bb79d1f519ae190a

Released with version 2.8.
