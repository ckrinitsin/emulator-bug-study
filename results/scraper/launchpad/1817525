    hw/ppc: Use object_initialize_child for correct reference counting
    
    Both functions, object_initialize() and object_property_add_child() increase
    the reference counter of the new object, so one of the references has to be
    dropped afterwards to get the reference counting right. Otherwise the child
    object will not be properly cleaned up when the parent gets destroyed.
    Thus let's use now object_initialize_child() instead to get the reference
    counting here right.

The fields of the struct are naturally aligned, so this should be easy enough to fix just by dropping QEMU_PACKED (we already have a compile-time assert that the doorbells field is at the expected address).

NB: I notice also the struct is marked 'volatile' -- this is a bit of a red flag that the code may not really be doing the right thing here.
