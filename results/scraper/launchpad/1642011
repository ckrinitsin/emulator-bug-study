Mouse wheel events not forwarded to guest using GTK display

Using QEMU 2.7.0 with KVM enabled, when I launch the guest without options (using the default of gtk), the mouse wheel events are not propagated to the guest.

When I start qemu using -display sdk, mouse wheel events are properly forwarded.

I can determine that the guest is not receiving mouse wheel events by doing cat /dev/input/by-id/usb-QEMU_QEMU_USB_Mouse_42-event-mouse. When I scroll the wheel, no output is printed to the screen.

The guest is ChromiumOS.

The command line is:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 2G -smp 4 -vga cirrus -usbdevice mouse -pidfile /tmp/kvm.pid -chardev pipe,id=control_pipe,path=/tmp/kvm.pipe -serial file:/tmp/kvm.serial -mon chardev=control_pipe -net nic,model=virtio -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:9222-:22 -drive file=chromiumos/src/build/images/amd64-generic/latest/chromiumos_qemu_image.bin,index=0,media=disk,cache=unsafe

(Most of that invocation sets up Linux fifos for various and nefarious purposes and can be profitably ignored).

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
