Sometimes, when not touching the SDL window, the guest freezes

I often just run some development guest machine, and leave its SDL window on a workspace I donâ€™t touch, and only interact with it via TCP.

And sometimes, the guest just freezes.

After it gets the focus back, it comes back to life (starts responding via network).

QEMU release version: 2.8.1.1

Which version of SDL are you using? SDL 1.2 or SDL 2.0? If you were using 1.2, could you please try 2.0 instead? Support for SDL 1.2 has been removed now.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
