Qemu 2.6 Solaris 9 Sparc Segmentation Fault

Hi,
I tried the following command to boot Solaris 9 sparc:
qemu-system-sparc -nographic -boot d -hda ./Spark9.disk -m 256 -cdrom sol-9-905hw-ga-sparc-dvd.iso -serial telnet:0.0.0.0:3000,server 

It seems there are a few Segmentation Faults, one from the starting of the boot. Another at the beginning of the commandline installation.

Trying 127.0.0.1...

That basically looks like it should work. The only time I've seen random segfaults similar to this is with a corrupted disk, so the first question to ask is whether you've verified the ISO image you are using? Unfortunately this isn't an image I currently have access to, but I can report my Solaris 8 32-bit ISO boots and installs fine with no issues here. Does it make any difference if you remove the -hda part of the command line?

Hi Mark,

I compared the cksum provided and the dvd cksum that i did, seems to match. I did try out Solaris 8 too. It seems to work fine with sun formatted hda disk. I did try removing the -hda for solaris 9, the problem still persist. I shall find if i can get another solaris 9 image source to try out. 

If you can verify that the media is correct and you still see problems, I'd be interested to take a look if you are able to provide me a copy of the media for debugging.


Hi Mark,

I have uploaded a copy of it to mega.nz

Hi Mark,

Attached is the new link: https://mega.nz/#!94ZVXBra!8QMsQ2d9eKKkMuawg_0YelfyWTy47CyyD1f6tvSv1bQ


Thanks for the test case. It appears that this is a regression that occurred somewhere between 2.5 and 2.6 - bisecting now.

Can you guys check if the problem persists when qemu is launched with
the -singlestep option?
I think it's in general a good idea always check TCG-related problems
with -singlestep , because it helps to find out whether a bug is in
the optimizer or generator module of TCG.

Hi Artyom,

I did manage to bisect this down to a single commit in the end: see
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-06/msg04039.html
for the commit in question.


ATB,

Mark.



Artyom has located the regression and posted a patch here: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-06/msg07226.html.

Hi all,

Thanks for the patch. I just tried, it seems to be not able to find the disk when it try to start the installation. :(

...

Please specify the media from which you will install the Solaris Operating
Environment.

Media:

1. CD/DVD
2. Network File System
3. HTTP (Flash archive only)
4. FTP (Flash archive only)
5. Local Tape (Flash archive only)

Reading disc for Solaris Operating Environment...

The system is being initialized, please wait... /
No Disks found. 
Check to make sure disks are cabled and powered up. 



I ran all the way through the installer in order to test the patch, so it should be working for you. Is your Spark9.disk labelled? See http://virtuallyfun.superglobalmegacorp.com/2010/10/03/formatting-disks-for-solaris/ for more information on how to do this.

Hmm.. strange. I did make a new disk went into the setup, then format the disk. After that, i rebooted and start that installation. But, it seems still there is no disk detected.

Okay. Can you confirm which version (or git revision) you've used to apply the patch so I can try and reproduce locally?


May 11 2016. qemu-2.6.0 from http://wiki.qemu.org/Download

I've just tried v2.6.0 with the recent ldstub patch applied and it looks from the output above that you're using an incorrect format to put down the disk label. I see the following:

Searching disks for upgradable Solaris root devices...
No Upgradable Solaris root devices were found.


Searching for locations to accommodate a temporary copy of the Solaris
installation software.  Swap slices are usually erased at reboot, so it is
preferable to place the Solaris installation software on slice labeled swap.

No swap slices that begin at the first usable cylinder have enough space
to accommodate a temporary copy of the Solaris installation software.

Using a slice that begins at the first usable cylinder allows the most
flexibility during filesystem layout. If you are doing an initial install and
you are not preserving any filesystems, you can re-partition a disk with the
swap slice starting at the first usable cylinder.

Would you like to re-partition a disk? [y,n,?,q] y

The default root disk is /dev/dsk/c0t0d0.
The selected disk will be re-partitioned before the Solaris installation
software is copied to the disk.

WARNING: ALL INFORMATION ON THE DISK WILL BE ERASED!


Do you want to re-partition /dev/dsk/c0t0d0 [y,n,?,q] y

NOTE: The swap size cannot be changed during file system layout.


Enter a swap slice size between 158MB and 34729MB, default = 512MB [?] 

Placing the swap slice at the beginning of the disk will allow the most flexible file system partitioning later in the installation.

Comparing your output with mine I can see two obvious differences:

1) You are using a different version of Solaris to label the disk in a way that can't be understood by Solaris 9

2) You've mistyped the "Physical number of heads" as 27 rather than accepting the default


ATB,

Mark.


Hi Mark,

Thanks a lot. Got it working now. When formatting the label, there are 2 options, SMI and EFI. Once I format it with SMI, it seems to be able to find the disk. 

Great news! FWIW with newer versions of QEMU, including 2.6.0, the framebuffer emulation is good enough to install and run Solaris (including X) without the -nographic/-serial options if you need it. I've also CCd the relevant patch to qemu-stable so it should appear in 2.6.1 also.

Many thanks for the report!


Hi Mark,

Thanks for the update. I would definitely be nice to have other than the black screen. Still got a problem though. I managed to install sparc9 but after i removed the cdrom, it fails to boot. 

qemu-system-sparc -nographic -monitor null -serial mon:telnet:0.0.0.0:3000,server -hda ./Sparc9.disk -m 256 -net nic,macaddr=52:54:0:12:34:56 -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no 

From an article written by Artyom, i did add 

# cat >> /a/etc/system

set scsi_options=0x58

^d

to solaris 2.6.

However, i think i didnt do this with solaris 8, it works fine.

For the solaris 9, it will allow you to either set it to not reboot but once you reached the end of the installation, it will reboot when you press enter. And the Sparc9.disk cannot be booted :(

If you use OpenBIOS then you don't explicitly have to set scsi-options since the value can be overridden via the device tree which is exactly what OpenBIOS does.

Interestingly enough it seems that the default bootloader for Solaris 9 is installed in the slice rather than the root of the disk as per my Solaris 8 installation. Fortunately you can manually boot Solaris 9 from the slice by entering "boot disk:d" at the Forth prompt.

Based upon this it probably makes sense to add "disk:d" to the bootpath used by OpenBIOS - I'll send a patch through to the OpenBIOS mailing list shortly.


Hi Mark,

I have tried boot diisk:d. After this

Not a bootable a.out image

Somehow I am getting invalid boot 

It works here as per my post above, so I think the problem is still with the disk label. With the above ISO image, I don't get asked for the type of label which makes me think you are using a newer version of Solaris for labelling than you are for installation.

Can you re-label the disk using the exact same image used for the installation and see if that makes a difference?

Hmmm I've just tried a second installation of Solaris 9 with a completely blank disk image and now it appears that "boot disk:a" is correct, i.e. boot from slice a. Not sure yet if this is the correct convention for HDs.

Hi Mark,

We are finally in:) 

By the way, how do you figure out which slice its in?

From solaris 8 dvd onwards, i seems to see 2 disk label options: SMI and EFI. Not sure why you didnt see those.

Great news! AFAICT it's just convention that the first disk slice is used, and I've also proposed a patch for OpenBIOS to include this in the boot search path in future, hopefully in time for 2.7.
