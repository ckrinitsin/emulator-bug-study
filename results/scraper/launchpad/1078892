qemu doesn't general protection fault if there are reserved bits set in page-directory-pointer table entries

While working on implementing 32-bit PAE mode in a custom operating system, which I was testing in QEMU, I noticed that my OS worked correctly, but resulted in a general protection fault when booted on VMware, VirtualBox, or bochs.

According to the Intel Architecture Manual, Volume 3A, Section 4.4.1 "PDPTE Registers", "If any of the PDPTEs sets both the P flag (bit 0) and any reserved bit, the MOV to CR instruction causes a general-protection exception (#GP(0)) and the PDPTEs are not loaded." QEMU does not emulate this behavior.

Triaging old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce this issue with the
latest version of QEMU (version 2.9)?
