PPC interrupt exception！

There is a exception on interrupt system when run the system with debug app on qemu-system-ppc.exe。I have try in version SHA-1: 2421f381dc38a8a6d12477c08c2f74a35a0698f8 no problem，but the next version SHA-1: 28f997a82cb509bf4775d4006b368e1bde8b7bdd have this exception。 And I found during this period in the repair of multi-threaded mutex，so I guess whether the PPC has some mutex needed are not taken into account。My english is poor，so there may be many grammatical errors。I hope you can understand the problem I described。

What kind of exeception are you seeing here exactly? Can you still reproduce it with the latest version of QEMU?
