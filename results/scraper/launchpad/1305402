libvirt fails to start VirtualMachines

I've created several kvm based machines with the 'trusty' designation using virtual machine manager. They have operated well over the last 4 days without issue. I did an apt-get upgrade, and qemu was in the list of updates.

After upgrading, I am unable to start any of the provisioned virtual machines with the following error output

virsh # start node2
error: Failed to start domain node2
error: internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: qemu-system-x86_64: -machine trusty,accel=kvm,usb=off: Unsupported machine type
Use -machine help to list supported machines!


virsh # start node3
error: Failed to start domain node3
error: internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: qemu-system-x86_64: -machine trusty,accel=kvm,usb=off: Unsupported machine type

$ dpkg -l | grep kvm

Log snippet from vm 'media' that was verified working, and fails to start after the upgrade.

After some additional investigating it looks like the XML format for the trusty machine has changed. I created a new VM and got it to boot off my MAAS cluster, The immediate change I see is:

new:
    <type arch='x86_64' machine='pc-i440fx-trusty'>hvm</type>

old:
    <type arch='x86_64' machine='trusty'>hvm</type>

None of the old XML machines were updated with this new machine flag.

Thanks for reporting this bug.  We briefly had a 'trusty' machine type, with a corresponding libvirt patch to handle it.  When we renamed the trusty machine type we dropped the libvirt patch to handle it.

We should either re-introduce the libvirt patch to handle the trusty machine type for those who have stale VM definitions, or mention this in the release notes.  In either case we should keep this bug open to guide others who run into this problem.

This has just happened to me. For some reason, all my machines had machine='pc-i440fx-wily'.
After an update in yakkety, they stopped working.

$ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -machine help | grep wily

So I updated the machine xml to a supported machine as Charles suggested, and they work again.

Here's the note for my future self about how to do the update:

$ virsh dumpxml $machine-name > /tmp/machine.xml
Edit the xml.
$ virsh define /tmp/machine.xml

There's a PPA in the bug with a fix for at least the wily machine type.

Yeah I'm pretty sure this is a dupe of bug 1626070.
