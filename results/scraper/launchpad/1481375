CentOS (host OS) does not register stuck keys, primarily CTRL, ALT, Windows Key, and escape.  Windows 7 Pro VM keeps getting sticky keys registered when I boot into the OS or randomly bring back up the console.  The keys getting stuck are CTRL, L_SHIFT, ALT, or Windows key, maybe escape.  I have to frantically repress the primary shortcut keys on both the USB keyboard and the laptop keyboard.  The USB keyboard is mechanical and clean.  The laptop is new.  Remember, the host OS does not register stuck keys.  If anyone has had this problem, or knows a trick to prevent sticky keys, I'm all ears.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU (currently v2.12)? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
