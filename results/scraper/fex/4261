Wine unable to load kernel32.dll â€“ Asahi Linux
Hi there,

First of all thank you so much for your great work! I very much appreciate running x86_64 applications on my Asahi Linux system. I am on the Fedora Remix `6.12.4-400.asahi.fc41.aarch64+16k` on my Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020).

But for now I was unable to start wine. When do the following commands (after deleting the `.wine` folder):

```bash
muvm -ti -- zsh
FEXBash
wineboot --init
```

I get the following output:

```output
wine: created the configuration directory '/home/faressc/.wine'
002c:err:seh:install_bpf prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, ...): Invalid argument.
wine: could not load kernel32.dll, status c0000135
0024:err:seh:install_bpf prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, ...): Invalid argument.
wine: could not load kernel32.dll, status c0000135
```

Can you reproduce this error?

Best wishes!
