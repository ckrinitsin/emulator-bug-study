32-bit Source games can't rotate camera 360 degrees
32-bit source games have a quirk where you can't rotate the mouse 360 degrees in both directions.
Moving right to left it is fine.
Moving left to right then the rotation will stop at some consistent point.

This is either a math bug in the CPU emulation or an ioctl bug in our ioctl emulation.
