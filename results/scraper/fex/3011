Okami HD has some case of spiky polygon syndrome
This is more easily visible in movement but can be reproduced by opening and close the menu a few times as seen in the picture. (The big triangle isn't supposed to look like that)
It happens frequently to vertices while the game is running. I don't remember seeing this before so it is likely a regression.
