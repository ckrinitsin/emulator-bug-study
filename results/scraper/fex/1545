Osmos: 32bit "Instawin" (Motes not spawning)
**What Game**
Osmos

Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/29180/Osmos/ (only contains 32bit version)
Demo: http://www.hemispheregames.com/latest_osmos_demo_linux_deb (contains both 32bit and 64bit versions, but has broken font)

**Describe the bug**
The 64bit version of the game works fine, might actually be flawless.

But the 32bit version has some really weird issues. When a level initialises, none of the motes appear, giving you just a blank background.

Advancing though any tutorial with space and then clicking will cause the game to check win conditions, and depending on the level, you might win or lose. 

Resizing the window (or switching between fullscreen/windowed mode) causes all the motes to spawn, and it becomes possible to complete the level, at which point you need to resize again to spawn the motes.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Launch the game.
2. Open the first level
3. Press Space when prompted to dismiss quote
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

Result with 32bit binary:

Dismissing the rest of the tutroal text and clicking presents this win screen:

Note: The demo version of Osmos from their website ships with a broken font that might cause issues depending on the rootfs version. Symptoms include "log message about font issue, some menu text not rendering, clicking not working". Replacing it with a good version of the font (I copied it from the steam version) fixes the issues.
