DX11 apps in Wine hangs randomly
Hello, first I would like to thank you for your great work!
I'm now working on a project which aims to run Wine natively on Android devices. We use both FEX-Emu and box64 as emulator backend. Now we can successfully boot into wine desktop with both emulator backends.

During our test, we found certain DX11 apps hangs at startup with FEX-Emu, stack trace shows most threads are blocked by futex_wait syscall. after trying with different config combinations, it seems adding multiblock could greatly reduce the chance of hang. This hang happens only with FEX-emu, not with box64 or runs directly on x86 machine.

The attachment is the DX11 app, extract the archive to c:\, run c:\directx\directx\nbodygravitycs11.exe, I can easily reproduce the hang.

My test environment is wine 7.0, dxvk 1.10.3, fex-emu 2303, runs on OnePlus 11, Android 13. 
P.S. Since I have patched fex-emu and wrote thunk libs to make it run on Android, I have considered the root cause could be in my patch. However my 3588 board still need sometime to arrive, so I think I could post it here, hoping people with capable hardware could help test it for me.
