std::shared_mutexes can't be safelly locked across forks
I run into this as part of #1558.

If they are locked before fork, then after fork they may or may not lockup on next lock, semi-randomly.

Looks like we need to roll our own `shared_mutex` implementation.

In general in need a gameplan for fork safety of FEXCore / Syscalls code
