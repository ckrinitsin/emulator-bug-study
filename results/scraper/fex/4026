Support scaling cyclecounter dynamically
Today FEX hardcodes a left shift of 7 for any cycle counter that is below 1Ghz. This was mostly done out of laziness because it covered all platforms I cared about at the time, and ARMv8.6/ARMv9.1 mandates a 1Ghz cycle counter to be compliant.

We should instead dynamically scale the cycle counter since there are platforms that have a higher frequency counter. Which apparently causes issues with libpsm2? We are still likely to typically hit scale factor of 7 or 6, so it won't change dramatically.
