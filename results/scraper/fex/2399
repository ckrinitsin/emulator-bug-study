Mingw compilation support
This is going to require quite a bit of restructuring.

**Step-0**
~~- [ ] Get FEXCore compiling with GCC~~
- [x] Get FEXCore compiling with llvm-mingw
  - Necessary instead of GCC path 
  -  https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw

**Step-1**
- [x] Move signal context construction to Loader side
- [x] Drop frontend targets from cmake that won't ever compile with mingw
- [ ] Remove Linux-isms from FEXCore side. Using wrappers where necessary
  - This is a big one, quite a few things spread around the source code
- [ ] JITs have some hardcoded assumptions here, might need to redefine some stuff so we can safely do some syscalls still
- [x] Handle SIGBUS/SIGILL FEX requirements in frontend
  - Requires a collaboration between FEXCore and FEX frontend to ensure nothing unexpected shows up as a signal frame 

**Step-2**
- [ ] Introduce Build CI so we don't break it
- [ ] Introduce unittesting CI

**Step-3**
- [ ] Integration

**Investigation**
- [ ] How well does clang-cl or clang with a windows target work? Would be nice to not need to deal with gcc/mingw compiler problems.
  - Initial testing showed linking problems that I couldn't resolve easily.
