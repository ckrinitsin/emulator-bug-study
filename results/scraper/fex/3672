ConstProp is missing a bunch of AddShift optimizations for loadstore addresses
A bunch of the ConstProp pass with loadstore address generation is looking for OP_ADD instead of OP_ADD and OP_ADDSHIFT. This has made loadstores a bit less effectively in the case where semantics match.

Remembered this when writing #3669, and @alyssarosenzweig said they were going to look more in to it a while ago.
