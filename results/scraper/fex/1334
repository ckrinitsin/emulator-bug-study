Config: Environment loader not hooked up to `ArgumentHandler`
Brought up by #1330.
Currently the `ArgumentHandler` function is only wired up for textual arguments passed through FEXLoader's arguments.
Environment variables need the same treatment.
eg: `FEX_CORE=irint` should work but right now it requires `FEX_CORE=0`
Same issue with FEX_SMCCHECKS.

These are the only two options that currently rely on this feature.
