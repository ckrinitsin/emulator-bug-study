Improve README.md
```it would be nice if in the project's github readme.md someone did put full procedure to get started
like dependencies install, and all commands needed to get it running, sort of like what you did with your comment in the issue i linked earlier, but with accuracy .. as in: it would work, no forgotten option, it would work for suggested environment, i mean actualy tested commands that result in a usable environment. that part is lacking and that's a bit limiting as for entry point into the project. it doesn't need to be very long, something like your comment on the issue, but accurate.
mentioning the required environment, telling it works in virtualized linux, using ubuntu version xx.xx .. i think, maybe all in all under 50 lines readme.md```
I'm on it
