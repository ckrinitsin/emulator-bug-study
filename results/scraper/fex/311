Unaligned atomic memory ops support
Currently x86 instructions translated to the atomic IR ops aren't expecting an alignment.
Compilers will go out of their way to avoid these unaligned atomics on the x86 side due to the "big ring lock" but they can still be done.
ARMv8.4-LSE resolves this issue mostly where it relaxes the atomic alignment problem.

But we still need to work with unaligned atomics on older ARMv8 versions, and doesn't resolve the problem of an unaligned atomic crossing a cacheline (x86 works in this instance).
Will need a backpatch + fallback handling, or if it happens non-frequently, handle it in the signal handler and dispatch a threaded recompiled replacement.
