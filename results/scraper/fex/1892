Setuid binaries in FEX Rootfs
fusermount is in the rootfs and is a setuid bit binary.
We need to scan through the rootfs (automated) and delete any binaries or packages that provide these.
These won't work and need to go to the host system to be found.
Just like how we provide a log of non-existing packages inside the rootfs, provide a list of setuid binaries that we should safely remove.
