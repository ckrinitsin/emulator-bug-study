Consider using Catch2 in FEXLinuxTests
Current FEXLinuxTests are limited to binary test results ("does it run without crashes?") and manual inspection of test logs. Catch2 allows for structured testing, where several properties can be tested independendly, each of which is highlighted explicitly with a REQUIRES macro. Catch2's automatic test discovery could also help clean up the build system logic.

> If we are going to implement catch2 in the FEXLinuxTests then it should be an indepedent task from this PR. No need to complicate this PR with changing test behaviours here.
