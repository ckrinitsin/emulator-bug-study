Classify unit tests with string feature requirements
Something in the config that we can query and gives a textual representation of what the runner (Host or FEX) needs to support to even try executing. Skip if it doesn't.
Something in the config section like:

```json
%ifdef CONFIG
{
  "RegData": {
    "XMM0": ["0x5152535455565758", "0x7172737475767778"]
  },
  "Requires": ["SSE", "SSE2", "AVX"]
}
%endif```
