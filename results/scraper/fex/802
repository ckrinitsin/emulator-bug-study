Deal with Robust list handling
For x86_64, the guest glibc's set_robust_list syscall just overrides the host glibc robust list. Which might be fine if fex itself never needs robust futexs.

But this gets iffy with thunks and libraries.

For x86_32, we just discard the guest robust list, which is problematic.
