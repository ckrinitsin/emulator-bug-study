Proton Crash in both experimental, 7.0-4 and other versions
When running games through Steam via Proton, the game crashes without giving any proper error message. Last message returned before exiting:

`Game process removed: AppID 322170 "/home/odin/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/reaper SteamLaunch AppId=322170 -- '/home/odin/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_soldier'/_v2-entry-point --verb=waitforexitandrun -- 'home/odin/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Proton 7.0'/proton waitforexitandrun '/home/odin/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Geometry Dash/GeometryDash.exe'", ProcID 4847`

This error message is virtually the same when running different Proton versions and different games (games tested: Geometry Dash, Arietta of Spirits, Final Fantasy 7, Sayonara Wild Hearts). Linux Native games work without issue.
