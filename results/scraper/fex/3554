amogus crashes if started through steam
**What Game**
[amogus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/)

**Describe the bug**
The game doesn't start (crashes after Innersloth logo fades out) if started through Steam. If the game is started directly (`proton .steam/steam/steamapps/common/Among\ Us/Among\ Us.exe` or similar) with steam NOT running, it starts up just fine, though without Steamworks access.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open amogus through steam (library / through a gameid link)
2. It crashes (sus)
3. Open amogus directly
4. It doesn't crash

**Expected behavior**
No crashes involved
