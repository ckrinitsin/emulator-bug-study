static-pie currently crashes
This is a tracking issue for upstream problems with static-pie.

* Currently lld generates relocatable sections with static-pie that glibc crashes on.
  * This will be fixed with lld 13.0 when it releases near the end of September
* Currently shared_mutexes crash static and static-pie executables
  * This seems to be a quirk with static and weak symbols
  * Happens with both gcc and clang
  * Theoretically will be fixed with glibc 2.34 which releases around August 1st.
