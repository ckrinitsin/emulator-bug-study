Feature request
Hi,

I'm Mr. Line, a very friendly guy.

Feature request:

A one-liner easy installer command for Raspberry Pi 4. I think a lot of us have this device.

Interesting project, wanted to test it because I haven't really been able to get qemu or Box64 to run on the Raspberry Pi 4 yet. The problem with all three projects I think is that there is no easy installer. Way over-complicated. If you want users, then you should have a one-liner installer.

Especially interested if FEX can provide a bash prompt where I can do anything as if I were running real hardware.
