Unaligned atomics are unsupported for ARMv8.0
On ARMv8.0, atomic operations are implemented using loadstore exclusive operations.
With #666 merged, unaligned cmpxchg{,8b} ops are supported on ARMv8.1.

To support these on ARMv8.0 correctly, we need to capture the loadstore exclusive routines faulting, read the next few instructions to see what sort of op it is (Just data movement or one of the atomic memory ops?) and do the full operation in the signal handler using aligned CAS loops.

Future looking work would be to signal that these blocks need to be recompiled with this directly in the block cache but we aren't there yet.
