Factorio 1.1.30 crashes when loading
Factorio is crashing at around 95% when loading sounds, attaching a log file from Factorio. 
I'm running FEX on a VirtualBox x64 VM running Ubuntu 20.04. 
Used the newest FEX version at the time of writing this. 
Factorio was downloaded from the game's website.
Chroot is also a base Ubuntu 20.04 rootfs with installed packages from the wiki. 
Did not remove the specified files and folders as that causes a crash right at the start with some memory crash, attaching what I got out of GDB then.
