Rework configuration system
- Missmatching argument vs env values
- Two layers of mappings that we don't really need to go through
- Factor common code out of FEXLoader, IRLoader, TestHarness, etc
- Add command line option to ignore any other layers (for CI, tests)
- Don't flatten default values / provide specific default values (possibly "default?") for easier config migrations
- Add configuration versioning for future automatic config migration
