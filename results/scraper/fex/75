Support CMPXCHG16B
Requires adding another GPR class to the RA that supports paired registers.
Then adding support for class interference support to the RA.
Probably will lead in to a bit of IR Op and RA cleanup in the process.
It's a useful instruction for lock free linked list implementations that people will definitely be using.
Also ensure the CPUID bit says it is supported
