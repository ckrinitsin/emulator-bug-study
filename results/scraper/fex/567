Have FEXCore fetch its configuration from the overlay configuration
Stated in the description of #566.
Currently the frontend sets up the configuration layers, but it is falling down the legacy codepath of the frontend still being required to pass the context its configuration.
The context should be able to fetch its configuration from the overlay configuration itself.
