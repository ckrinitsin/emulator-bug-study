No RootFS download available for Ubuntu 24.10
I just came here from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Uu99AvB6PY) from UbuntuConf 2024 and wanted to try FEX out. However, I'm running Ubuntu 24.10 on a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x with arm64. When I ran the installer script, I got a list of RootFS alternatives, but none of them match my Ubuntu version. Should I use the closest one (24.04) or do something else in order to be able to proceed?

Debugging info:
