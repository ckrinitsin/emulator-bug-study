Implement code segment dumping
Related to #85.
Allow dumping of code from an arbitrary PC, storing relevant data to allow running standalone from the application executing.
Needs to store state like RIP, Allocated memory regions, Incoming state, outgoing state(?Might not be worth hassle), and potentially accessed memory region data
This will be useful for microbenching RA on large functions very specifically.
Ensuring runtime correctness of the ripped out code is something second to care about.
