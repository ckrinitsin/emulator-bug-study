x86 LXC guests on ARM64?
Hello,

It would be really cool to be able to be able to migrate and run entire unmodified amd64 LXC guest systems on ARM. I do not see this mentioned in issues so far. But it seems you already have most of the functionality to make this possible, even relying on a full x86 rootfs to be present, one step from there to launching that root FS as a full guest system. What remains is some kernel cgroup/namespaces stuff, and starting emulation with the "init" process which would then start the rest of its services, not a particular single app.

Would you consider adding this? Or maybe it is possible already?
