Add error handling for memory allocation in TestHarnessRunner
It's confusing when the test harness runner inexplicably fails because of memory allocation problems.
This can be reproduced by enabling ASAN and trying to run tests through the test harness runner.

Just needs error handling added to the memory allocation to see why it failed.
