Question: How to properly use software renderer (OSMesa) with FEX-Emu for StarCraft II?
Hi team,

I'm currently using FEX-Emu to run the Linux `x86_64` version of StarCraft II (using the game binaries provided in the [`[Blizzard/s2client-proto](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto)`](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto) repository). I'm trying to run the game with software rendering by passing the `-osmesapath` parameter, pointing to the following library:

```
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOSMesa.so.8
```

Since I'm using software rendering, does this mean the x86 version of the OSMesa library will be used and executed via FEX?

In an attempt to improve rendering speed, I tried replacing the library with the native AArch64 version:

```
/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libOSMesa.so.8
```

However, when doing so, the game fails to load the library properly.

What is the correct way to use OSMesa with FEX-Emu in this scenario? Is there a way to benefit from the native AArch64 OSMesa for better performance, or must I stick with the x86 version?

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!
