VVVVVV crashes with Vulkan+GL thunks enabled
The game crashes early with a SIGSEGV when vulkan and GL thunks are enabled. GL alone might work but it seemingly blackscreens?

Anyway, the SIGSEGV occurs because it uses xcb to try and get the PULSE_COOKIE x11 window property, which it gets but then fails to parse (Bad data returned?).

GL alone doesn't trigger the crash since xcb thunking is disabled in that case.

The game crashes because not getting the pulse cookie is fatal and it fails to setup some sound samples, it then continues to try and load a pointer that was never allocated.

Problem should go away once we rewrite how the X11/xcb communication occurs?
