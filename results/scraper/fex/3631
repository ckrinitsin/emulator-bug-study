Blocks are not physically removed
I haven't looked into the algo in detail but it feels to me like we should not ignore the return value of `std::remove`. This does not physically remove the Predecessor, simply moves it to another place. We should probably use `std::erase` here. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erase%E2%80%93remove_idiom
