Newest Steam update (Feb 29 2024) fails to launch steamwebhelper
Tested with commits 0ef72bf11 (previously working) and 9ae55ff

Steam simply logs:

```
steamwebhelper.sh[6094]: Starting steamwebhelper under bootstrap sniper steam runtime at /home/cmcging/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_64/steam-runtime-sniper
```
and tries to restart it once a minute or so. The "steamwebhelper, a critical Steam component, is not responding." dialog appears as well.

System: Ubuntu 23.10 on Pi 5
