Syscall emulation has incorrect global mutex
There is a scoped mutex at the top of the syscall handling function.
This is incorrect and causes the application to stall once threading kicks in.
Should be removed and only have a mutex on things that actually need it.
Can be done alongside syscall cleanup.

I think skmp wanted to have a go at this?
