Failed to load driver: vc4 (Raspberry Pi 5)
Hi,

I'm running FEX 2410 on a Raspberry Pi 5 with Raspberry Pi OS Lite using the preconfigured Ubuntu 24.04 as RootFS. I've been getting this error when running x86_64 Carla :

```

```

Some plugins I'm using with Carla need some video acceleration to run properly, I'm guessing it has to do with the "failed to load driver" part (though I have no way to compare). I've done some digging on Linux video drivers, but this goes beyond my abilities since there's no vc4 drivers available that I could install on the RootFS.

I've been playing around with this for some time, is this known behavior I never noticed, did something change, or am I looking at the wrong thing ?
