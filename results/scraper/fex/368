Allow POSIX tests to be disabled between CPU backends
The interpreter currently isn't reentrant safe.
This means we are disabling a bunch of posix tests atm because of this.
We should have two different files for disabled tests, one for interpreter and one for IRJIT.
That way we can keep running JIT posix tests and disable the problematic ones on the interpreter.
