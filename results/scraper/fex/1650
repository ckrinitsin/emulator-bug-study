[Apple M1/Asahi Linux] <jemalloc>: Unsupported system page size
Hello, I'm running into the following error when FEX is built and run on Asahi Linux:

```
<jemalloc>: Unsupported system page size
<jemalloc>: Unsupported system page size
<jemalloc>: Unsupported system page size
terminate called without an active exception
Aborted
```

Is there a know workaround or fix?
