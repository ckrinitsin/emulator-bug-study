Deduplicate 3 tables in Config.cpp
In Config.cpp we have three tables that duplicate a bit of information.
Clean this up to remove duplication and tie the config enums to config option name and environment variable stronger.
Maybe also just define the data with the enum in FEXCore config enum.

`std::map<>ConfigToNameLookup`, `std::map<>ConfigLookup`, `std::array<>ConfigLookup` is the duplicated data.
