[regression] JIT assertion in glxgears and other content
Simple content like glxgears has been failing some vixl assertions in debug builds recently:
```
Assertion failed (rd.IsW())
in /home/tony/projects/FEX/External/vixl/src/aarch64/assembler-aarch64.cc, line 4584
Aborted
```

Reverting cffd10d0 fixes the issue. CC @Sonicadvance1
