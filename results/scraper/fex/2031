FTL crashes when using GL thunks without GLVND
Running the game using a mesa build with GLVND disabled triggers a crash on startup:
```
Thread 1 "FEXInterpreter" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to Thread 0x7ff7ff1010 (LWP 7822)]
0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()
#1  0x0000007fe11adb84 in fexfn_unpack_libGL_glXCreateContextAttribsARB(fexfn_packed_args_libGL_glXCreateContextAttribsARB*) () from /usr/lib/fex-emu/HostThunks//libGL-host.so
#2  0x0000007fe25fd3d8 in ?? ()
```

The crash is caused by `fexldr_ptr_libGL_glXCreateContextAttribsARB` (called in the unpacking function) being `nullptr`.
