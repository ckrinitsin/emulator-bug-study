FexLinuxTests backlog
An internal backlog of tests (mostly for me), so the tracker is not spammed with too many of these tickets. 

If you have any corner cases that you want tested, or ideas for edge case behaviour we don't cover feel free to leave a comment here and I'll generate a test case, as time allows.

This is meant for "nice to have" tests, and not as a general way to avoid including tests with future PRs
