AVX128: Blends with immediate selector completely unoptimized
This includes the whole family of blends:
16-bit: VPBLENDW
32-bit: VPBLENDD, VBLENDPS
64-bit: VBLENDPD

64-bit blend is definitely the easiest where we should be able to move or zip depending.

32-bit and 16-bit get a bit more spicy.

These are all currently implemented with just a loop of inserts in to a zero register, so they are quite low performance atm.
