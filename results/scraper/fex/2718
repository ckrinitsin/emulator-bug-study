Spider-Man: Miles Morales launcher takes a long time to start
This is weirdly anomalous and seems to be hitting some edge case in FEX's emulation. I have noticed a couple of D3D12 games that have this issue but Miles Morales seems to be the easiest to test since it loads in to a launcher instead of directly in to a game.

The syscall behaviour is very peculiar as well since the CPU thread that is at 100% load is only calling madvise periodically
