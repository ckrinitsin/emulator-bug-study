Graphical programs not launching on Switchroot Ubuntu (Updated)
I keep running into multiple build errors during the final stage of compilation. I'm on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 18.04 on my Nintendo Switch running Switchroot Linux. I installed dependencies as listed in the quick start guide (as well as some that weren't listed, such as `sudo apt install libstdc++-8-dev` to prevent the error message "#include <filesystem> : file or directory not found"). However, some build errors just won't go away. I'm not sure what my next steps should be, but I'll upload my build log below. I'd be happy to help any ways I can.
