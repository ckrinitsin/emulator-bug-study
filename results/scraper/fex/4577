Upgrade clang-format to something other than 16
Debian and Ubuntu in their infinite wisdom struck down clang-16 while keeping the other versions from 14 onwards. We just so happened to be using that version of clang for clang-format.

```
$ apt-cache search clang-format
clang-format-20 - Tool to format C/C++/Obj-C code
clang-format - Tool to format C/C++/Obj-C code
clang-format-14 - Tool to format C/C++/Obj-C code
clang-format-15 - Tool to format C/C++/Obj-C code
clang-format-17 - Tool to format C/C++/Obj-C code
clang-format-18 - Tool to format C/C++/Obj-C code
clang-format-19 - Tool to format C/C++/Obj-C code
```

We should upgrade to clang-format-18.
