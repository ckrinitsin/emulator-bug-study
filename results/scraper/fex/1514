Implement custom std::unique_ptr to remove offsetof warnings.
Latest C++ container objects are all becoming non standard layout and using offsetof with classes/structs that contain them is undefined behaviour.

It's well defined that it basically works but this is the only way to get rid of the warnings without rearchitecting a disgusting amount of context access code.
