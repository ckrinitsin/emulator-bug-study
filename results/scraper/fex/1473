Cities: Skylines crashes once getting to main menu
Crashes with SIGSEGV trying to access address zero.
Does this after opening and closing `/dev/zero` weirdly.
The game also seems to use MAP_32BIT to map executable code regions. Could be an issue with our MAP_32BIT emulation or could just be an SMC problem.
