Library Forwarding: Find a more reliable way to deal with wl_interface globals
libQt6WaylandClient.so ships its own set of `wl_interface`s, which interferes with our code at: https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/blob/a5fad89e57127e91ca3f6b7d6b020e65f7d7fb5f/ThunkLibs/libwayland-client/Guest.cpp#L10-L27

This can be reproduced simply by starting [Cutter](https://cutter.re/) in FEX, which will hang during startup. Using `WAYLAND_DEBUG=1`, it will print the error `interface '(null)' has no event 0`.

A reliable workaround is to set `LD_PRELOAD=libwayland-client.so`.
