InstCountCI: Support multiple instruction tests
Right now we can't test simple things like cost-prop optimizations. We don't really want huge tests in this CI but smaller things make sense.
eg:
```asm
mov rax, 0
mov rcx, 0
cpuid
```
This would hit a more optimal case but our CI can't show it yet.

This will require implementing some way to dynamically choose block size to compile  and just a list in the json. Likely changing the instruction name in to just a tag.
