Need to update Vulkan Headers for thunks.
Newer Vulkan drivers (like Mesa 24.0) ships a newer version of Vulkan than what our thunks supports. This causes DXVK to use features that our thunks don't support and results in games having early initialization failure.

We currently ship: v1.3.261
Mesa radv ships as of writing: 1.3.274
Current header version as of writing: 1.3.278
