Crash Bandicoot 4 uses `PCMPESTRI` unconditionally.
First game I have found that uses it even when SSE4.2 CPUID bit isn't exposed.

Likely want to implement this initially as a C fallback, but there should be some investigation in to optimizing it to SVE MATCH plus predicate twiddling since even with SVE-128bit it might be more optimal.
