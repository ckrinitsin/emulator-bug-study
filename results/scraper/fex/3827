AVX128: `vgatherqps` and `vpgatherqd` might be able to be optimized with `LD1W { <Zt>.D }, <Pg>/Z, [<Xn|SP>, <Zm>.D]`
Currently these operations fall down the ASIMD path universally. We might be able to use this weirdo zero extending gather from SVE and then swizzle the components down to where we want them instead.

Need to noodle on it a bit.
