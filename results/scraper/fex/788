AUXV values are wrong
- AT_PHDR doesn't point to the header (crashes ldconfig), it also points to the interpreter when not static elf
- AT_PHNUM doesn't match host value (maybe it is set from the interpreter instead of the program ?)
- AT_ENTRY points to the interpreter entrypoint
- *IDs are fixed to 1000, not the current user information
- AT_HWCAP is set to 0 (bfebfbff on my laptop for 64 bit process)
- AT_HWCAP2 doesn't exist in guest
- AT_SYSINFO shouldn't exist for x86-64 binaries
