Bit accurate Transcendental support
This is a long term goal.
Currently we don't offer bit accurate transcendental instructions.
Reciprocal and reciprocal square root instructions have a fairly large range for their precision support.
These are currently implemented with float divisions to ensure all of the CPU backends match results and have same unit test results.

These precision differences have the fun quirk that usually something like the reciprocal of 1.0f results in a result that isn't 1.0f even.

We should have support for a few modes once this gets worked on.
1) Bit accurate representation that matches *SOME* known hardware
2) Most accurate representation (What we have now)
3) Accuracy that falls within x86 precision requirements, but doesn't match any known hardware (In case any device supports less accurate results that are still within x86 spec)
