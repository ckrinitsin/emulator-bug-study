AOTIR futexes causing hangs
Steam has a really high chance of hanging due to AOTIR futexes. Theoretically because these are being held while a fork is called?
Really frustrating since this interface is currently broken and unused anyway, so it getting in the way is a pain.
Needs to be fixed because it is likely the cause of hanging in other obscure situations.
