Unity games hanging
Noticed this recently, Unity games are likely to hang early with a black screen.
Working: FEX-2405
Notworking: 314fea36b4420f648a209b8c9ec589eecef35f8d

Bisecting range is relatively small.

Known hanging game is Donut County but I've seen various other Unity games that are also affected.

Supposedly "Dave The Diver" Should work on the newer commit but doesn't work on the older commit? Will need testing.
