Rework frequently used anti-patterns in the codebase
Some commonly used anti-patterns that make our lifes harder while working with FEX
- Re-use of class names with different namespaces (makes navigation, search and replace, debugging hard)
- Overly, inconsistently namespaced codebase
- File names that don't match the class name, or missmatching .h/.cpp file names
- Inline forward declarations in header files
- Inconsistent grouping of helper libs

These should all be addressed.
