global destructors in XCB thunks need to be removed
Global destructors in shared libraries aren't guaranteed to be called on dlclose but instead on exit.
In particular this is never called when Dota Underlords closes, which can cause it to hang on shutdown.
This is because the xcb::take_socket thread never exits and ends up stalling out.

Needs some investigation as to which route will be the best to ensure that thread is always shutdown and nothing is waiting.
