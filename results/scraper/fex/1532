32-bit socket ioctls aren't interpreted correctly.
We don't currently capture socket ioctls and just pass them through.
This causes a few socket based ioctl commands to not be correct.

* SIOCGSTAMP_OLD
* SIOCGSTAMPNS_OLD
* SIOCGIFPFLAGS
* SIOCSIFFLAGS
* SIOCWANDEV
* Any other ioctl that returns `struct ifreq`
  * https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/netdevice.7.html
* Maybe more that I missed.
