How to proceed with building FEX-Emu inside an arm64 container (for testing)
Hello,

I am trying to to build FEX inside a CentOS-7 aarch64 container. How do I go about this (i.e. are there sepcific compile options I need to look into)? Next I have created a CentOS-7 x86_64 chroot with all the libraries I need for running my x86_64 program, how do I tell Fex to use the chroot I made? 

If all goes well, I want to move this into my proot container as well (is FeX supported inside proot to?) 

Thanks
