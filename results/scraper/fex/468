FEX Bash
Wrapper bash program that allows FEX to capture bash scripts and redirect programs that do architecture checking.
Good example is GOG scripts that check for 32bit or 64bit and will fall back to 32bit since the architecture isn't x86_64

First step would probably be a script that wraps the bash script and sets up environment variables so something like uname falls down a FEX loader path
`fexbash GOG/7\ Billion\ Humans/start.sh`

Next step would probably be a bash shell that gives a terminal shell where you can execute commands in a pseudo-emulated environment
```
$ uname -m
aarch64
$ fexshell
$ uname -m
x86_64
```
