Fix Thunk/VDSO loading in a chroot.
Brought up on Discord that thunks aren't available in a chroot.
At the very least we should fix VDSO since random applications will break without VDSO, maybe hardcoding the two binaries in to FEXInterpreter as a build step.

OpenGL and Vulkan thunking inside of a chroot is less interesting since it is only a performance improvement rather than potential compatibility issues.
