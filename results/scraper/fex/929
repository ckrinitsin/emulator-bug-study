INTO implementation
FEX has an INTO implementation but it was disabled when we found out that it was 32-bit x86 instruction.
Now that we are supporting 32-bit x86 we should implement a unit test for this and wire it to the dispatcher tables.

Might only be a partial unit test since we can't catch or generate synchronous signals yet. There is another issue about supporting that.
