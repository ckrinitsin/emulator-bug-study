Cortex-A78 r0p0 has atomic errata that needs runtime workaround
Needs a `DMB ST` in front of every atomic load acquire instruction that doesn't have release semantics.
r1p0 and r1p1 doesn't need this as TZ will workaround it for us.

Need to check SoCs and upcoming SoCs to see if any manage to ship r0p0
