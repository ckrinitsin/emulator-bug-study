Very unstable steam: self-closing popups and freezes
Currently running FEX on krunvm, which in turn is running on Asahi Fedora Remix (GNOME), hardware is an M1 13' MacBook Pro w/ 8GiB RAM and 256GB SSD.

When I try running steam, it's very hit & miss, but I managed to see some patterns in the seemingly neverending issues:

- Dropdowns and popups immediately disappear, one in about 50 cases happens to stay
- Freeze when the display is woken up from sleep (5 minutes idle -> system goes to sleep and locks, Steam freezes after unlocking)
- Freeze when opening a file selection window (add library drive)

I'll be happy to provide any additional info I might've missed.
