EmulatedFiles: High CPU usage in canonicalize
https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/blob/f2aa0026b58c9ec5ee56ecbf66b4f00fe01e16de/Source/Tests/LinuxSyscalls/EmulatedFiles/EmulatedFiles.cpp#L744

I was running AntiChamber and I saw >30% CPU time spent on this canonicalize routine during loading (which took hecking long).
We need to optimize this use case. Dropping to `realpath` is likely a good first step. Will need to run some benchmarks to see how much of an improvement that alone is and if it is worth going further.
