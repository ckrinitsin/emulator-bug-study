Walk through personality flags on 32-bit and 64-bit and ensure correct behaviour
Not sure exactly how much this matters but we should double check it.

Flags to support:
- UNAME26
  - Needs emulation
- ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE
  - Already handled in ELFCodeLoader
- FDPIC_FUNCPTRS
  - nop on x86
- MMAP_PAGE_ZERO
  - Allowed but doesn't do anything on x86
- ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT
  - Changes allocation to BottomUp instead of top-down
  - Would need emulation
- READ_IMPLIES_EXEC

- ADDR_LIMIT_32BIT
  - nop on x86 
- SHORT_INODE
   - nop 
- WHOLE_SECONDS
   - nop 
- STICKY_TIMEOUTS
  - Causes select, pselect, and ppoll to not modify timeout on signal handler interrupt.
  - Passthrough to host kernel makes FEX impl a nop. 
- ADDR_LIMIT_3GB
  - Changes the upper limit on mmap from 0xffff_e000 to 0xc000_0000 for 32-bit processes
  - Needs emulation
