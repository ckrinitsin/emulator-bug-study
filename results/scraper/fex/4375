InstallFEX error with fex-emu-binfmt32/64
As many people here I am trying to use FEX on an OCI Ampere (so arm64), trying to build a Dockerfile on debian:bullseye-slim. I keep getting this error and don't find much documentation online on systemd-binfmt.

```
systemd-binfmt: unrecognized service
dpkg: error processing package fex-emu-binfmt32 (--configure):
 installed fex-emu-binfmt32 package post-installation script subprocess returned error exit status 1
[...]
Errors were encountered while processing:
 fex-emu-binfmt32
 fex-emu-binfmt64
```

Here is the Dockerfile sample if it can help :

```dockerfile
FROM debian:bullseye-slim

RUN apt update && apt install -y curl python3 sudo expect-dev software-properties-common

RUN curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/main/Scripts/InstallFEX.py --output /tmp/InstallFEX.py

RUN python3 /tmp/InstallFEX.py
```
