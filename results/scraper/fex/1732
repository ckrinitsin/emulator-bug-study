TME extension: ideas on how to (ab)use it
Following up from yesterday's discussion, 

For `tso`/`non-tso` memory tracking, we might be able to group accesses between atomic ops in transactions, and detect concurrent access with transaction aborts. Might get us more precise tracking than the [MTE](https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/issues/1731) approach.

For synchronous detection of segfaults, we might be able to wrap code between guest abi sync points around a transaction, and on transaction abort execute some slowpath. Details on synchronous signal complications in #1682
