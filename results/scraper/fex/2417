use binfmt.d rather than binfmts for better compatibility
binfmts is only available on debian based distro. which isn't friendly to other distro. i prefer switch to [binfmt.d](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/binfmt.d.html) (which is a part of systemd, available on most of distro) and keep binfmts for debian only
