Thunks don't pick up environment variables declared through FEX config files
Currently if you use thunks and set environment variables, then thunked libraries will miss those environment variables.

This is easy to see by thunking libGL and setting vblank_mode=0 for testing.

We most likely want to pass these new environment variables through setenv once config is load and only if thunks are used.
