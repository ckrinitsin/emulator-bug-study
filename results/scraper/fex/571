Execve fails due to /proc/self/exe usage
We determine if we are in "Interpreter" mode by checking application executable name to be FEXInterpreter.
Interpreter mode is necessary since we need to ignore arguments passed in since it breaks execution in a lot of cases.

`/proc/self/exe` sees through our softlink to FEXLoader which means we lose the determination that we are the interpreter.

We have two options.
- Disable all argument loading and just use FEXConfig for option setting.
- Do a hardlink install to FEXLoader
