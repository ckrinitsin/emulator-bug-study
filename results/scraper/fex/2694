Shadow of the Tomb Raider slow initialization
Running under Proton 7.0, the initial launcher that comes up is burning a bunch of CPU time in our RA for some reason.
Native Linux client doesn't have the issue but this is because the Nixxes launcher is replaced with some Feral CEF one (Which has different issues).
