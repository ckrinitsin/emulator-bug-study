"Current RootFS path set to '' " when passing RootFS manually
My command is  `Bin/FEXLoader -R ~/D*/WINE ~/D*/WINE/bin/winecfg`. However, it fails with 
```
Invalid or Unsupported elf file.
This is likely due to a misconfigured x86-64 RootFS
Current RootFS path set to ''
RootFS path doesn't exist. This is required on AArch64 hosts
```
