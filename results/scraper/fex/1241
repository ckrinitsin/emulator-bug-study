Support 64-bit ioctl emulation
Thunks will largely take care of this but for the fallback case we need to support emulation to work around struct packing quirks.
This mainly comes from 64bit values having a 4 byte alignment on x86 and x86-64 while on aarch64 they have natural alignment.
I have already encountered this issue on V3D/VC4 ioctls.
