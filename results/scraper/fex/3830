Wine issues in Fedora 40
Wine is having problems in Fedora 40. One problem is that execve is leaking the absolute path to wine inside the rootfs.
Additionally if that is fixed/hacked then wine stops finding paths in its z: symlink.

Seemingly wine changes behaviour if it is executed from its install prefix versus $ROOTFS/$prefix?
Not sure how we haven't hit this before but the behaviour is different between Fedora and Ubuntu which is kind of annoying.
Potentially a Wine 9.0 (Ubuntu) to 9.5 (Fedora) change affecting things?

Tricky stuff. Will need some extensive testing with Proton to ensure we don't regress anything since the overlayfs is kind of fragile.
