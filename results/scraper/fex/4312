FEXConfig input issues
When trying to input a string in one of the boxes, I type a letter, the textbox loses focus and there's a small "sleep", type another letter and so on. Each time I try to type something I get in the console:
```
qrc:/qt-project.org/imports/QtQuick/Controls/Fusion/SpinBox.qml:30:18: QML QQuickTextInput: Binding loop detected for property "text"
```

This is with qt6 on Ubuntu 24.10 on the Lenovo T14s
