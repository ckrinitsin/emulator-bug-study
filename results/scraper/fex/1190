Offline telemetry report
It will be beneficial to have offline telemetry for FEX for determining things that applications do.
This will be entirely offline and only stored to a file on the local machine.
Three operating modes. Only saves last run of information.

1. None - Doesn't save the data at all
2. Minimal - Only minimal information about the application (Default)
3. Verbose - Gives some extended information that otherwise wouldn't be saved

 2) Uses AVX (with 256bit register)
  - Minimal - Simple bool
  - Verbose - Which op was used and width
 3) More
