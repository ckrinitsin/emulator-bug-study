need help automating FEXRootFSFetcher
I went back and tested my [automatic build script](https://github.com/cobalt2727/L4T-Megascript/blob/master/scripts/FEX.sh) for FEX to make sure it was still working and I've hit a roadblock - there doesn't seem to be any way to automate choosing a RootFS. Is there any way to have it always pull the latest/most recommended version without any input from the user?

(it doesn't even display the options if this line is run from within the script itself.)
