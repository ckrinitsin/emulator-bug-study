Geekbench 4 Camera max-threads rare deadlock
This is rare, semi-reproducible  you need to loop with -T the same as host

```bash
count=0; while :
do
let "count+=1"; Bin/FEXLoader -T 24 -s --aotir-load -- ../../Geekbench-4.4.4-Linux/geekbench_x86_64 --section 2 --workload 213 && echo worked $count
sleep 1
done
```

When you hit a deadlock, you can gdb attach and see all threads are in a futex syscall, and they are all waiting on the same futex:

in gdb you can use `thread apply all print/x $rdi` to print out which futex each thread is on
