Built in Debugger: Rework interfaces, make sure things work
Currently the Visual Debugger is non functional, and it depends on debug interfaces that are no longer implemented and miss features like multiple thread support.

A large part of those interfaces was disabled in #1842.

We need to
#### Milestone 2210
- Define a fuller, actually implemented debug interface
- Add tests for that interface

#### Milestone 2212
- Update the visual debugger & gdb shims to use those interfaces, or make a decision to remove the visual debugger / gdb shim
- If we keep the visual debugger / gdb shims, make sure they are built and tested.

Follow up from #1842
