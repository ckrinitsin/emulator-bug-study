Enabling XCB thunks breaks steamwebhelper
Thunking for libxcb is currently not compatible with steamwebhelper. Steam will start fine, but no browser content will render. Looking at console output, steamwebhelper keeps being restarted over a SIGILL. This indicates the issue is related to function pointer thunking.

Example config:
```json
{
"ThunksDB": {
"GL": 0,
"xcb": 1,
"xcb-dri2": 1,
"xcb-dri3": 1,
"X11": 0,
"xcb-xfixes": 1,
"xcb-shm": 1,
"xcb-sync": 1,
"xcb-randr": 0,
"xcb-present": 0,
"xcb-glx": 1,
"xshmfence": 1,
"drm": 0,
"Xrender": 0,
"Xext": 0,
"Xfixes": 0,
"Vulkan": 0,
"asound": 0
}
}
```
