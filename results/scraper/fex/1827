Vulkan thunking support with DXVK
Currently enabling Vulkan thunking with DXVK in Wine currently results in crashing.
The initial issue is missing some X11 symbols in our X11 thunks, but then after that it seems like multiple conflicting issues

## Installing DXVK
* Download DXVK from their Github Actions artifacts to get a recent build
  * https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/actions/workflows/artifacts.yml?query=branch%3Amaster
  * Extract
  * `FEXBash`
  * `export WINEPREFIX=/path/to/.wine-prefix`
  * `./setup_dxvk.sh install`

## Enable Vulkan thunks
* Enable thunks in a 64-bit Windows application that is D3D9/10/11
  * I use `dxcapsviewer.exe`, so create an app profile in `~/.fex-emu/AppConfigs/dxcapsviewer.exe.json`  
  * https://github.com/microsoft/DxCapsViewer/releases/tag/feb2022
* Execute a D3D9/10/11 game with FEX+Wine
* `FEXBash "wine dxcapsviewer.exe"`
* Watch it explode

## Helpful bits
* `export WINEDEBUG=+module` can give more information about why a library fails to load.
* Execute wineserver in the background to keep it around and reduce testing startup time
  * `FEXBash "wineserver -f -p"`
