IRListView copies should support allocating from slab allocator
Currently each IRListView copy calls in to malloc to create the copy.
glibc seems to be hitting the worst case where it is  and then calling mprotect for every IR copy. This is significantly more overhead than necessary and is dirtying strace output quite heavily.

We should allow passing in a slab allocator to this instead to reduce the number of syscalls we are doing here.
Keep the malloc path in the case we want an independent copy still.
