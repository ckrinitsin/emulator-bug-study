Project power grab
Hello ya all,

![Screenshot from 2022-09-01 17-02-35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/393266/187935806-81d7b2e5-a91e-4530-a067-a4cdd4a54537.png)

I consider this to be schemed by @Sonicadvance1, as @phire has minimal commits to the project, and hasn't been active in a very long time.

To give some context, I internally raised some issues wrt to @neobrain's conduct, then the next meeting was canceled a few hours before because @Sonicadvance1  "had to travel", then my admin rights in fex-emu.org google workspace were somehow missing, and not willing to be re-instanted, and while I was blissfully working on some other things I saw this.

Even though my access to the discord server was removed, I've kept logs of my original complaint, as well as the (several pages) of discussion that followed with @phire.

@Sonicadvance1 and @neobrain didn't participate at all for days.

In order to prevent the spreading of further misinformation, and in my defence towards https://fex-emu.com/Uncomfortable-decision/ and https://twitter.com/FEX_Emu/status/1565334640423948288, I'll be redirecting fex-emu.org to a more neutral page.

I would like to state here, I was given no time to appeal the process or advance knowledge before the public posts, which is indicative of a power grab, as I didn't have any chance to review the accusations, defend myself or bring forth evidence.
 
While fex-emu was supposed to be a collective / consensus based project, at least in discussions, in practice there had been a lack of transparency in communications and a clear internal hierarchy established, with @Sonicadvance1 not sharing information with the other "maintainers". 

I'm asking of everyone involved, to take a mediation step and try to resolve this, and to discuss everything in public, so long as we are not contractually bound not to do so, as to avoid behind the scenes scheming.

I guess I'll update this ticket with further information?

Not sure if I'm still a member of the github org, but if so I'll be removing myself as I'm clearly not welcome here.


**update**
Of course i've been removed, it's a proper power grab ;)

**update 2**
