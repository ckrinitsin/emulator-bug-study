Latest Steam stable update (Jan 2025) fails to start due to CEF crash loop
Steam fails to start up since last week's update due to a crash in CEF's network service, indicated by webhelper-linux.txt:
```

This has been reproduced on 3 different devices (macbook with Linux VM, X13s, T14s). Downgrading the Steam client to the 20241204072114 update reliably resolves the problem.
