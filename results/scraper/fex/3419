Build system tries to use __attribute__((preserve_all)) on clang 16
The test program actually compiles on clang 16, because the test function takes 0 arguments and that is apparently not a problem for clang 16 - preserve_all only fails once you add an argument.

Breaks the build on arm linux, as of this writing.
