Support longjump-style faultable code segments
This will be necessary for sigill handling in the frontend decoder and /maybe/ can be used for EFAULT handling in the syscall emulation.

Basically longjump, but with signal causing the long jump. I saw some game that would have benefitted from this a while ago, but I don't remember what it was.
