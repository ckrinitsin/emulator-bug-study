no member named '__sem_otime_high' in 'semid_ds'
Looks like a glibc and kernel desync. Needs to get investigated.
```
now stuck in
../Source/Tests/LinuxSyscalls/x64/Types.h:83:11: error: no member named '__sem_otime_high' in 'semid_ds'
      buf.__sem_otime_high = sem_otime_high;
Loads of these?

apparently, x86_64 doesn't either?
yes
those ifdefs seem broken

Create an issue report about it. Will need to double check the kernel interface and see if this is a mismatch between glibc and kernel
