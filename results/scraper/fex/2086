Trying to open Intel Quartis Prime 18.1
Hello when I try to execute quartus using FEXBash I run into the following error:
`FEXBash-root@oriol-Parallels-ARM-Virtual-Machine:/home/oriol/Intel_Quartus/quartus/bin> ./quartus
quartus: error while loading shared libraries: libpng12.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
`
Thanks
