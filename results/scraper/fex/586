Add optimization pass that changes integer divide to shifts
Loads of integer divides are dividing by powers of two.

First task is to investigate how often the divisor can be const propagated.
Second task is to see what percentage of those divisors are power of twos
Third task is to convert the division from a divide to a shift. Either by using SBFE or BFE for the sign handling depending on udiv or sdiv.
