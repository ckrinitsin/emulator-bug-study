clang -mcpu/tune=native doesn't pick up Snapdragon 865 correctly
This is causing atomics to be terrible loadstore acquire/release pairs for everything outside of the JIT.
Even clang 11 is effected by this.

First step would have our cmake script check for this and explicit place cortex-a77 there.
Also -march=native isn't supported on ARM with clang, so the current cmake check does nothing. It needs -mcpu or -mtune.

Second step would be to upstream changes to clang/llvm so it is picked up correctly. This way it can be supported on at least clang 12.

Might also effect Snapdragon 850, so c630 is also slower?

Causing pain with interpreter cmpxchg fallback unit tests.
