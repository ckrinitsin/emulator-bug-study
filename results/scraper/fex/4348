Investigate what's missing with EasyAntiCheat
Not sure what's missing here, it's a known unknown. Collate a list of games that use EAC and have the Proton support enabled, then try to find a game that is relatively small for testing.

Apparently Fall Guys was only like 8GB, but it recently updated and removed support for Proton.
