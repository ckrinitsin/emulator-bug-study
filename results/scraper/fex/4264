Cached predicate register being clobbered by softfp lib call
Unfortunately, the code to cache predicate registers for SVE x87 ldst optimization and the precision tests that do a bunch of:

```
load
op
store/pop
```

were developed at a similar time and landed more of less at a similar time. We might not have SVE hw in CI and I didn't test this until now. The culprit commit is 72a40636515aaa8986f500ce7f4c5cb546d6127f . What's happening is that in this specific case we are caching p2, calling softfp fcos impl which clobbers p2 and its use in fstp causes the bug - i.e. the test to fail.
