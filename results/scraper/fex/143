OverlayFS filesystem emulation
We need better filesystem emulation for x86 specific data that will appear

- [x] `/proc/cpuinfo` - Support generating this on the fly based on emulated CPUID
- [ ] `/proc/self`  - Fairly large folder of various information
- [ ] `/sys/devices/system/cpu/online` Currently we state this as only 1 core. We should allow this to be configurable and default to host core count
- [ ] Find more that expose x86 data (libnuma has some things)
