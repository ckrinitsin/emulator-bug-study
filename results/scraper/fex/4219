Error Running Wine in Arch Linux ARM
With latest release, 2412, Arch linux ARM for the Raspberry Pi complains about not being able to find ntdll.so. It looks like it is trying to load it from /proc/../lib32. It did work in the previous release, 2410. Also, not sure if this is related, but even in the working version sound is very crackly in 32 bit applications making them pretty much unusable.
