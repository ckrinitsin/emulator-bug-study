Change the LD_LIBRARY_PATH for native libraries?
Hi there,

I've just installed FEX-emu on my Android 12 phone running Ubuntu 23.10 in a Proot environment.
In order to get proper OpenGL (using zink) and Vulkan using freedreno's turnip, I've manually compiled mesa from source and installed it in /usr/local/lib64 and /usr/local/lib.

So I've set:
```
LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/dri:/usr/local/lib/dri
VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/local/share/vulkan/icd.d/freedreno_icd.aarch64.json:/usr/local/share/vulkan/icd.d/freedreno_icd.armv7l.json
```
And I've also created a ```/etc/ld.conf.so.d/000-local.conf``` with:
```
/usr/local/lib64
/usr/local/lib
```

This works great for native things like glxinfo, vkcube and supertuxkart:
```
$ MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink glxinfo
...
OpenGL vendor string: Mesa
OpenGL renderer string: zink Vulkan 1.3(Turnip Adreno (TM) 640 (MESA_TURNIP))
OpenGL core profile version string: 4.6 (Core Profile) Mesa 24.0.0-devel (git-a921a69010)
OpenGL core profile shading language version string: 4.60
OpenGL core profile context flags: no-error
OpenGL core profile profile mask: core profile
...
$ vkcube
Selected GPU 0: Turnip Adreno (TM) 640, type: IntegratedGpu
```

However, when I run steam, it doesn't seem to load the native libGL from /usr/local/lib{,64}:
```
$ MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink FEXBash steam

Looks like steam didn't shutdown cleanly, scheduling immediate update check

Any ideas?
