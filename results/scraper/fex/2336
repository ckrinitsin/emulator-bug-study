Chromium sandbox tracking bug.
Chromium applications executed under FEX can't correctly use their sandbox in our environment currently.
Usually this can be resolved by passing the application `--no-sandbox` which will disable the sandbox.
Not all applications support this, and some will refuse to run if passed that option.

At some point FEX needs to support running the sandbox environment but this will be a tracking bug when we find applications that hit this issue.

Known applications that use chromium's sandbox
- ~~steamwebhelper~~
- Mathpix snippping tool
- Chrome/Chromium
- anki flashcards
- Some game launchers that I need to find again
