Half-Life 2: e53f3969e9cc causes hitching under certain `fps_max` conditions
**What Game**
[Half-Life 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/220)

**Describe the bug**
Half-Life 2 suffers from extreme hitching and instability - even at menus - on Apple Silicon machines. Notably, this _only_ occurs when the engine is actively limiting frames via `fps_max`. It does not occur when `fps_max 0`, nor does it occur when the achievable framerate is lower than the `fps_max` limit. Of course, this is is almost never the case on these machines ;)

This is most obvious in certain menu maps, as well as while playing. I have bisected this down to e53f3969e9cc. Reverting back to the old `pause` behaviour clears this issue.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Fire up Half-Life 2
2. Go to Episode 2
3. Observe the menu system hitching
4. Fire up an Episode 2 save game
5. Observe the game hitching to the point of unplayability

**Expected behavior**
The game should run without hitching.

**System information:**
 - OS: Gentoo Linux
 - CPU/SoC: Apple M2 Max (also repros on M2, M2 Pro, and M1 Pro)
 - Video driver version: [Mesa `asahi-20241204`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/asahi/mesa/-/tags/asahi-20241204)
 - RootFS used: @WhatAmISupposedToPutHere/fex-rootfs (Minimal Gentoo x86 with asahi mesa overlayed)
 - FEX version: Prints nothing (???), but it's upstream FEX-2410 with no patches.
 - Thunks Enabled: Yes

**Additional context**
 - Is this an x86 or x86-64 game: x86
 - Does this reproduce on AArch64 with Radeon/Intel/Nvidia: Untested
 - Is this a Vulkan game: Via Source's DXVK integration
   - If Yes, What is your Vulkan driver: Honeykrisp. Behaviour is reproducible with both the DXVK and toGL pipelines.
