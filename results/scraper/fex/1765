SMC: Compile code needs to mprotect before reading, or stale core might be run
More likely to happen in the armv8.0 runner
```
read/modify/segfault (no write made)
code cache flush
{other thread starts compiling here}
read/modify/write
{other thread finishes compiling, mprotects}
stale code gets run
```

Also, tear-tests should be run a statistically important number of times to catch these cases
