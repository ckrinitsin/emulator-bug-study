Vulkan thunking support with zink
While this isn't an ideal situation that an x86/x86-64 Zink is communicating with an AArch64 vulkan thunk, this should be a case we support.
Currently this crashes our Vulkan thunks

```
vkGetInstanceProcAddr: Couldn't find Guest symbol: 'vkGetInstanceProcAddr'
```

It searches for a bunch of vulkan symbols that don't exist so it definitely performs a bit odd compared to regular applications.
