can't dlopen: libFEXCore.so: cannot allocate memory in static TLS block
Hi,
I'd like to use libFEXCore in Hangover ( https://github.com/AndreRH/hangover/ ), but a major blocker is that I can't dlopen it.
The message "libFEXCore.so: cannot allocate memory in static TLS block" seems to indicate that the library want's to use more TLS memory than statically available, but even if I (for testing purposes) remove all thread_locals from libFEXCore, I get the same message. Any idea?

Note that using LD_PRELOAD works for a test application, but won't be viable for Hangover/Wine
