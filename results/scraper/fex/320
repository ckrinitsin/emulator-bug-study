Program specific config files
We should have the ability to check the program filename and have an overlay config file for it.
This can solve the issue when we know up front that an application is doing evil things and we can change config options to handle it.
Should be easy enough, we just need another layer that loads from `${INSTALL_PREFIX}/fex-emu/configs/<App>.json` and probably also `${HOME}/.config/fex-emu/configs/<App>.json` for user configs.
