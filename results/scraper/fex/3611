Steam streaming now crashes with an assert
This used to work but it seems something changed on Steam's side that broke this. When streaming a game from some other system to the Arm64 system then Steam will SIGABRT with the following log message.
```
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
  what():  basic_string::_S_construct null not valid
```

Interestingly this doesn't affect streaming from an arm64 device to some other device. Seems to only be a decoder issue rather than an encoder issue.

Changing decoder settings to use hardware decoding doesn't change behaviour. Needs some investigation.
