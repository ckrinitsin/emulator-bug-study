Incorrect orbital familiars movement in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth
Orbital familiars are supposed to spin in a circular motion around the main character. In FEX however they bounce around in a semi-circle, changing movement direction each time they have moved by 180Â°. This can easily be reproduced within few seconds in challenge 6 ("Solar System"), where the main character starts with a number of orbital familiars that each have this problem.

This also affects enemy groups that normally arrange in circles, such as the pink ring flies, which arrange in a semi-circle in FEX instead.
