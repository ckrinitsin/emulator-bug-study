GDBServer: info regs invalid when in syscall
Simple solution (aka workaround) is to optionally flush the context before syscalls when the the gdb server is active.

Complex solution is to generate some kind of unwinding data from our codegen which allows rebuilding of the context at any point (or any sync point such as memory reads and syscalls).

The complex solution might be useful for other things later, like providing correct contexts for segfaults
