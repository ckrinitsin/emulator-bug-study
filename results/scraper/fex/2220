Build fails - CMake Error
On Asahi Linux, I tried installing both from the AUR (fex-emu and fex-emu-git) as well as manually following the wiki directions.  In all cases, I get the following CMake error:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:298 (strong): string sub-command STRIP requires two arguments.
