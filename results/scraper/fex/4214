**What Game**
Factorio `2.0.23 (build 80769 expansion, linux64)` (Space Age mods disabled)
https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/

**Describe the bug**
Massive FPS drop when zooming out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a new singleplayer Freeplay game (I used seed 1)
2. Start the game
3. Observe that the game is running at 60 FPS
4. Zoom out
5. Observe that it drops to 15 FPS

Note that some menu animations also drop to quite low FPS, I assume it's the same issue.

**Expected behavior**
The game runs smoothly.
