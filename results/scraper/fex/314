Library for path canonicalization
With our rootfs implementation, we need to support path canonicalization with explicit support for the rootfs as the root directory.
Then on top of that a regular canonicalize that treats `/` as a rootfs as well.
This is required to support both so applications can't trick our path checking

eg: `/proc/../cpuinfo` would currently trick our emulation and get a real host `/proc/cpuinfo

eg: `/usr/../../test.txt` would escape the rootfs and load a `test.txt` in the same folder as the rootfs if one existed
