Deus Ex: Human Revolution: 2d53867668af x87 optimisations causes early CTD on Apple M2/M2 Pro/M2 Max
**What Game**
Deus Ex: Human Revolution
I am testing with the retail copy which is no longer available on Steam, but Director's cut should be the same and can be found at https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/238010/

**Describe the bug**
The game's menu system is heavy on x87. 2d53867668af introduces optimisations which cause the game to crash to desktop before the copyright information (the first frame after loading the game) is shown. This occurs both with and without reduced precision enabled.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Deus Ex: Human Revolution
2. Game loads its window/fullscreen surface then immediately crashes to desktop

**Expected behavior**
The game should not crash to desktop

**System information:**
 - OS: Gentoo Linux
 - CPU/SoC: Apple M2 Max
 - Video driver version: Asahi Mesa 20241204
 - RootFS used: Gentoo RootFS with Asahi Mesa overlayed
 - FEX version: FEX-2502
 - Thunks Enabled: No

**Additional context**
 - Is this an x86 or x86-64 game: x86
 - Does this reproduce on AArch64 with Radeon/Intel/Nvidia: Untested
 - Is this a Vulkan game: Yes via DXVK
 - If Yes, What is your Vulkan driver: Honeykrisp

Add any other context about the problem here.
I cannot reproduce this on M1 series hardware interestingly enough...
