POSIX tests compile ROOTFS env variable in to build
Instead of allowing cmake to embed the ROOTFS environment variable in to the build files, pass the env variable to the posix runner script.
This will solve the problem of running posix tests, but forgetting to set the environment variable, thus requiring a new cmake step prior to just running ctest.
You'll be able to just set the environment variable and immediately run ctest
