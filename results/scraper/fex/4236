HW Accel issue on rk3588
Hello, I've recently switched from box64 to fex since i can't get steam/games working there.
When running steam i get the following harmless errors: (Steam runs fine but software rendered)
```
MESA: error: failed to mmap the LATEST_FLUSH_ID register (err=22)
glx: failed to create dri3 screen
failed to load driver: rockchip

I've confirmed that /lib/dri/rockchip_dir.so exists in both the aarch64 root and x86_64 root
I've also checked using `glxinfo -B` and confirmed that hw accel is working
Even tried running a game, All works fine.

Any ideas?

Edit: I'm running linux 6.13.0-rc3 (Panthor GPU driver) with fex 2410-1 on armtix linux on an Orange Pi 5 Plus
