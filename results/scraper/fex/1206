Compatible with Linux4Tegra (e.g. Nintendo Switch, Nvidia Shield)?
Asking as this would effectively solve the issue of Steam Remote Play being nearly impossible to get working adequately on the Switch with rail-based joycons (since there isn't a native version of Steam Link for ARM Linux, and Android still has incredibly buggy rail joycon support that stops working half the time).
