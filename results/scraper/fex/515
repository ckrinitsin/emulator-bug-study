Allocator hooking for 32bit and 64bit
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc_hook.3.html
We need to hook these functions and replace them in the frontend so our application is handling all memory allocations ourselves.

There are 3 sub tasks here

 - [] For 64bit these effectively just pass through.
 - [] For 32bit we need to steal the upper 64bits virtual memory region so 32bit mmap and ioctl will be forced to allocate in the lower 32bit region
  - This allows us to do stronger investigations to see if we require the Linux kernel to have new syscalls
 - [] Pass allocation routines throughout our core so thunked libraries in 32bit applications hit our malloc and force allocations in to the lower 32bits

I would like the first two tasks to be completed in two weeks time, so roughly around December 3rd. Since I know RA is currently higher priority for @phire. This is one of their secondary tasks.

Something like this was also asked for Wine integration, which also wants some hooking for thread allocation which is a different task.
