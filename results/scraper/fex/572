Allow environment variable to pass in application config location
Either allow passing a folder to search for the application config in, thus allowing a single folder to service multiple config files.
And/Or allow passing an environment variable with a single config file to use regardless of app config.

eg:
`FEX_APP_CONFIG_LOCATION=$(PWD)/AppConfigs/`
`FEX_APP_CONFIG=/tmp/Config.json`
