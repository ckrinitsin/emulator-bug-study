DEBUG builds are currently broken with jemalloc overrides
When we build debug, something is trying to pull in malloc symbols that we don't have in jemalloc.

We should either figure out what symbols the debug libraries want, or disable jemalloc in debug.

Disabling jemalloc isn't ideal since then we break 32-bit application execution.
We should find what symbols we have failed to override in this case.
