Proton 6.3 hangs when run from Steam
When running Proton 6.3 built from source then games run fine.
When run inside of the pressure-vessel runtime with the official distributed version then it hangs for some reason.
Need to investigate and diagnose why this is. Otherwise we are stuck with Proton 5.13 testing.
