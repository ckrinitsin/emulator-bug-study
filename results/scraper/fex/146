Convert all string formatting to {fmt}
Rather than `printf` and `cout` everywhere, [{fmt}](https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html) is the future

It's an implementation of std::format that works in versions of c++ before c++20. By standardising on {fmt} now, we can easily switch to `std::format` later.
