Denuvo needs inline self-modifying code support
Currently it crashes because of an invalid instruction.
The instruction stream (From Hatsune Miku Project DIVA Mega Mix+) starts as follows.
```asm
1569854b0  812d000000001896â€¦  sub     dword [rel data_1569854ba], 0x1b519618  {0xa20f9090}  // Modifies the next instruction
1569854ba  a826               test    al, 0x26  // Instruction modified
1569854bc  61                 ??
```

The initial sub instruction in this block is modifying the code just after the instruction. Which turns it in to:
```asm
0x00000000   1                       90  nop
0x00000001   1                       90  nop
0x00000002   2                     0fa2  cpuid
0x00000004  10     8105f2ffffff1896511b  add dword [rip - 0xe], 0x1b519618
0x0000000e   1                       c3  ret
```

The final add there modifying the code back to what it was before.
FEX need to have a generic (and fast) solution towards detecting something like this if we want any Denuvo Anti-Tamper games to work.
