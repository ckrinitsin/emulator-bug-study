Failure to setup client after installation
**Describe the bug**
After installing Fex on my arm64 laptop (Lenovo Yoga Slim7x) running Ubuntu Concept 24.10, choosing the Ubuntu 24.04 SquashFS, using it as-is and setting it as the default, the "trying basic program run" step fails with the following error message:
