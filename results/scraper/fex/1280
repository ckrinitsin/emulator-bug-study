CI for thunks
Thunks are particularly fragile especially when we have multiple memory allocators flying around.
We need a CI that tests thunks to some extent to make sure we don't break them.

Particularly need tests that stress thunks that are allocating memory and passing it to the guest.
Hopefully something that is hitting xcb since those libraries allocate quite a bit of memory and pass it to the guest.
