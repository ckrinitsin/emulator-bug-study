Add any other context about the problem here.
This is ran on a Radxa Orion O6 using ARMtix linux & ACPI boot with mainline linux 6.15-rc1.
I'm also running this with an RX 580 since the onboard GPU does not have mesa drivers yet.
There are no errors, Game just hangs for some reason after a bit of playtime, No idea why and i've tried changing basically every setting in FEXConfig..

Last i checked this wasn't an issue on SDM845 (My OnePlus 6T)
I was able to play there for quite a while without issues.
