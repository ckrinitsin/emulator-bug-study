FEXLinuxTests: SIGFPE not raised in ./synchronous-signal-block.64
`./synchronous-signal-block.64 sfpe` and `./synchronous-signal-block.64 afpe` should print `Got 8 at address: ...` since they're triggering a SIGFPE. However, when running these tests in FEXInterpreter, that doesn't seem to be the case.

I have not ran those tests on an x86 host yet, so it's unclear if the bug is in FEX or in the test.
