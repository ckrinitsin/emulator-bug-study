Classify CoreState differently depending on if host supports AVX or not
Keep the XMM elements 256bit in size but classify them differently as a union or something.

```
union {
struct {
uint64_t XMM[16][4];
} SupportsAVX;
struct {
uint64_t XMM[16][2];
uint64_t _Pad[16][2];
} NoSupportsAVX;
};
```

This way we can still use LDP and STP still for non-SVE2 ARM.
Needs to set up the classification path to support both.
