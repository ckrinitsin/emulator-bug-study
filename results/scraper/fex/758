Make artifact file moving not fail
If a unit test pass fails early then all additional tests are skipped.
Currently all ctest result files are moved even if those tests didn't run.
These moves will fail and look like additional spurious failure
Add something like a `|| true` at the end of those moves so they don't look like additional failures.
