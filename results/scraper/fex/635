Make ASM and IR tests track compiled file dependencies correctly
Custom targets `asm_tests`, 32bit_asm_tests`, and `ir_tests` don't currently have a dependency on their respective `{asm, 32bit_asm,ir}_files` target.
This means you can accidentally run the tests without the compile being as fresh as possible.
