Thunks are broken?
I can't get thunks working on an AArch64 host.
We need a guide on how to get these to work.
Tried installing to the precompiled rootfs (Just overwrite a bunch of the libraries with the same versioned libraries?) and it just tried calling some thunked function (that didn't exist as a hash?) and explodes.
This is completely blocking for anyone wanting to toy with thunks.

See the discussion on Discord, even me throwing an hour or two of time at the problem, couldn't figure out why things weren't working.
