Some posix tests are race happy
Loads of tests do some sleeping or forking and sleeping.
Which this results is buggy racing.
We need special handling of these to stop them randomly breaking
Probably serializing the tests and maybe a small retry loop.

difftime-1-1 was one that I just saw as being a race.
Bunch of random signal tests are also race happy.
