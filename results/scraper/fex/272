Curl/OpenSSL failure
```
./Bin/ELFLoader -T 1 -U -c irint -n 500 -- `which curl` -v -H -GET https://google.com
```

This gives a fairly bad output.

This failure point is in openssl. One can build their unit tests and run the `ectest` unit test to see the failure.
Looks like it could be a failure in their BIGNUM implementation but more testing needs to be done.
