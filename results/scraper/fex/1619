Support Apple TSO mode enable bit
Once the kernel has some sort of interface for enabling this flag (prctl?, arch_prctl?) then wire this up.

This should be as simple as changing the TSO IR ops to fall to the "non-atomic" variants and adding a flag to the code cache config.
M1/M1X is already significantly faster than Snapdragon even without this hardware feature enabled. So it would just be an improvement on already fast hardware.

TODO: Is there a way to make non-coherent loadstores happen while this TSO flag is still enabled? Loading from our context, TLS, and stack accesses that we already convert to non-TSO for example.
Would need someone with hardware to test. Worst case we just eat the TSO cost always, which isn't terrible.

TODO: Hopefully the kernel interface is per thread, so our helper threads don't pay the TSO cost, since they don't need it.
