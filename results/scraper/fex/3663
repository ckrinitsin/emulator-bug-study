Look in to optimizing PCMPESTR*
A Hat In Time's Menu abuses the instruction in both the main menu and in-game. See if we can make it go faster.

Ideally the SVE `NMATCH` or `MATCH` instruction can be used to emulate the feature.
The hot loop uses both ECX result and flag result depending on where it is in the loop.

Comes from vcruntime140.dll, wcsstr. A micro bench would be quite easy to generate.
