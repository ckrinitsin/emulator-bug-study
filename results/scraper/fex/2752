java crashing on shutdown on arm64
Doesn't seem to happen on an x86 host for some reason, but on AArch64 it seems to be the case that it will close on shutdown.

Causes [Project Zomboid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid/) to fail early and seemingly a simple enough test of just running `jre64/bin/java -version` is enough to see it.
