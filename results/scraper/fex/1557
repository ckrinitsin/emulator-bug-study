Minor installation issue using installFEX.py and FEXRootFSFetcher
Hi, I'm new to use FEX and I installed it yesterday on proot Ubuntu on Termux. 

The `installFEX.py` in Ubuntu 21.10 KDE Konsole proot on Termux doesn't work as expected. `installFex.py` would skip user input of `FEXRootFSFetcher` and show `Unknown response. Assuming no` right away. 

Also, `FEXRootFSFetcher` downloading  breaks easily. If an incomplete file is present, the fetcher fail always attempting redownload. Eventually I have to go into the folder and use `wget`. But http download breaks often and I tried around 10 times before successful yesterday.
