METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE Crash with multiblock enabled and x87 reduced precision disabled.
This game is usually capable of running, but when using full precision x87 and multiblock it seems like it crashes once reaching the title screen. It gets through its intro images.

| Multiblock | Reduced Precision On |  Reduced Precision Off |
| - | - | - |
| On | ✅Works | ❌Crashes |
| Off | ✅Works | ✅Works |

Couldn't bisect it far enough back since Multiblock was fairly sketchy a few months ago.

(Looks like Mirror's Edge might have the same problem.)
