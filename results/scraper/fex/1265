Check for container-manager redirect some folders
We need to check for `/run/host/container-manager` existing and containing `pressure-vessel`
If both those are true then we need to redirect a bunch of installed folder searches from `$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to `/run/host/$CMAKE_INSTALL/PREFIX`

Easy enough, just need to hit all the locations that do a search.
