32-Bit X11 OpenGL thunking incompatibilities mega-issue
I have concerns about thunks being enabled by default (especially 32-bit), neobrain wanted receipts, so here they are.

DE used: i3wm. This is important as xwayland and other DEs will behave differently.

Goal: Find which 32-bit games break when thunks are enabled.

- Anything DXVK obviously doesn't matter since X11 Vulkan 32-bit thunking isn't a thing. But some retesting landed.
- Most games crash, some hang. Nothing really interesting from initial glance.
  - Works:
    - [Linux][GL] Grim Fandango Remastered
    - [Linux][GL] Battleblock Theater
    - [Linux][GL] Osmos
    - [Linux][GL] Hotline Miami
    - [Linux][GL] Full Throttle Remastered
    - [Linux][GL] Pajama Sam's Lost and Found
    - [Linux][GL] Cave Story+
    - [Linux][GL] Dungeons of Dredmor
    - [Proton][DXVK] Sonic Mania
    - [Proton][DXVK] Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair
    - [Proton][DXVK-Native] Left 4 Dead
    - [64-bit][Linux][DXVK-Native] Counter-strike Source
    - [64-bit][Linux][DXVK-Native] Team Fortress 2
      - One of the few Source engine games that are 64-bit.
  - Doesn't:
    - [Proton][GL] Peggle Deluxe
    - [Proton][GL] Gish
    - [Proton][GL] Crayon Physics Deluxe
    - [Proton][GL] Fieldrunners
    - [Proton][GL] Plants vs. Zombies: Game of the Year
    - [Proton][DXVK] Bejeweled 3
      - Even though this game uses DXVK, does something with GL.
    - [Proton][GL] RAGE
      - This one actually fails because thunks break Mesa's ability to find EXE names.
    - [Linux][GL] Black Mesa
    - [Linux][GL] Counter-Strike GoldSrc
    - [Linux][GL] Day of Defeat
