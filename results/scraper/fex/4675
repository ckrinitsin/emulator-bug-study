Teardown: ground tile under player gets culled from view
**What Game**
[Teardown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1167630)

**Describe the bug**
The square tile of ground the player is very close to (either standing on or the next one over), when viewed from some angles, does not render. Instead, the map below is visible (see videos), probably because of a math error that makes the tile count as very far away instead of very close by(?)

This happens with **both** OpenGL and VKD3D, **and** it feels like a very coarse massive-tile kind of culling that I would expect to happen on the CPU, so I think it's more likely to be an issue with FEX than with Mesa, but I could be wrong. If anyone could test on non-Qualcomm GPUs, that would quickly prove or disprove my hypothesis :)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Start playing, it's immediately obvious

**Expected behavior**
The ground being solid :)
