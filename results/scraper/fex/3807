Portal 2 currently crashes under FEX
Seems to crash with a nullptr deference in their vscript.so library. Not sure what it is doing. Once at the title screen just click "Continue game" and seemingly once it gets done loading it'll crash before it goes in-game.

Trying to bisect this on the FEX side had me going back to FEX-2301 and still getting the crash. So this seems to have been a change on the Portal 2 side causing issues.

Doesn't seem to be running out of memory either, so it's a peculiar one. Might need to actually fix the gdbserver to debug this one.

Didn't try running it under Proton, which might be a viable workaround.

Dave the Diver and Peggle Deluxe breaking are likely related in some form.
