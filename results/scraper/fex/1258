Gamepad input is inconsistent?
Noticed this while running Scourgebringer (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1037020/ScourgeBringer/)
This is a native Linux 64-bit application.
Noticed while running on an AArch64 host. Haven't tested on an x86-64 host.
Could be ioctl related?

Had a basic Xbox One controller connected over USB and the game didn't see its inputs at all.
