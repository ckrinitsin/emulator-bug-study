How to use FEX in non-privileged container?
I’m using a containerized cloud server, but I don’t have full Linux privileges. This means I’m unable to use binfmt_misc or install new file systems like SquashFS. I want to run x86_64 software (specifically, StarCraft II via https://github.com/google-deepmind/pysc2) on an arm64-based system. Is there any possible workaround or solution?
