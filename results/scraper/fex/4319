Reciprocal estimate not accurate enough
Currently on systems with rpres extension we generate `frecpe` for a `pfrcp`. The AMD manual mentions:

> The maximum error is less than or equal to 1.5 * 2^â€“12 times the true reciprocal. 

Unfortunately for, for example 1.0, the result of `frecpe` is 0.998047. The result should be within `(1.00037 | 0.999634)` to be within the required accuracy.

Should check other functions as well.
