AOTIR: Deleting the RAData inappropriately
https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/blob/42a632093545d0bf74bb1d87e285e58fa18d0aef/External/FEXCore/Source/Interface/IR/AOTIR.cpp#L353

This is allocated using using FEXCore::Allocator::malloc, then it tries to get freed with C++ delete.

This is why when allocating it we have it in a unique_ptr with a custom deleter, but the code is just wrong here. 
`std::unique_ptr<IR::RegisterAllocationData, IR::RegisterAllocationDataDeleter> AllocData;`

This causes LLVM asan to just immediately barf.
