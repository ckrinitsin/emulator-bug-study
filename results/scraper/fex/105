Have IR pull relevant bits of data from a textual representation
We can do things like `<GPRPair> = CASP <GPRPair>, <GPRPair>, <GPR>` directly in IR definition file rather than having that information encoded with a bunch of arguments.
Would take a decent amount of work to ensure it is correct so this is a longer term goal
