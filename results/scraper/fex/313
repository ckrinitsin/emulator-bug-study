Unhandled fault backpatching to sigtrap instruction
On unhandled fault we should be able to backpatch the instruction and rerun it as one that generates sigtrap so we can still backtrace the host in GDB.
Still needs some thinking about, and it would be nice to also do the guest side so we can backtrace in gdbstub.
