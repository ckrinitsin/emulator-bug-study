Question about FEXRootFSFetcher
hello,

I have installed FEX in a docker image but I need to run FEXRootFSFetcher ( when building the image) , then It should type "yes" and then "1" and then "2" but is there any way I can do this because there is no input when building a docker file?

I can not do this after the image is build as the data need to be percistant.
