Support AVX list
Find a list of games that use AVX unconditionally to gauge priority for implementing.
We need both good enough performance and a list of games that use AVX before thinking about implementing.
It'll have a minor perf hit to implement since all of our context switching ends up being twice the size.

Games that use AVX unconditionally (at time of writing or that we've discovered):
- Cyberpunk 2077 (Unconditional usage removed in 1.05)
- Metro Exodus (And enhanced edition)
- Sonic Frontiers
- Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection
- Returnal
- Death Stranding
- Forspoken
- Star citizen
- Sea of Stars
- Starfield
