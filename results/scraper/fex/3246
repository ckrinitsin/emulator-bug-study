wine: segmentation fault
when i run wine with fex like
```
DISPLAY=:1 FEXInterpreter /usr/local/bin/wine64 wineboot
```
i'm getting segmentation fault, if i try to run it just like `FEXInterpreter wine64` it prints the help message, but if i specify just ANY argument for it (except --help and --version) it segfaults, even if there's no such file/program (like `FEXInterpreter wine64 abcd`) also that problem is same for both wine and wine64

P.S. i have fex from ppa, FEXLoader --version says `FEX-Emu (FEX-2309.1)`
