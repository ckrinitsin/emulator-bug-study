I've found [this article](https://bytecellar.com/2022/11/16/a-secret-apple-silicon-extension-to-accommodate-an-intel-8080-artifact/), about some undocumented extension in apple silicon cpus, designed to eliminate the need for parity and adjust flag calculations in software, and this project seems to be the only time and place in the universe where this might be useful.
