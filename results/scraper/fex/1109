Need help compiling for Manjaro ARM
I'm new to the whole chroot idea. I see that we have to mount a `rootfs` for x86_64. I have installed qemu and even debootstrap for installing the chroot. My issue is what comes after that. I don't know how to set up the chroot to be piped through FEX. Can someone push me in the right direction?

Edit: I also got as far as to try to actually chroot into the rootfs. But I should have known that wasn't going to work. Incompatible binary types.

This is also really vague. I don't understand the exact requirements for this to run on an Arch based system. Seems simple enough for debian though.

I am also getting similar issues to the ones in #997
