Wine on proot (Termux): err:winediag:nodrv_CreateWindow
Thanks a lot for making this exciting x86 emulation project!!

I tried to `wine winecfg` in FEXBash (wine-5.0 comes with RootFS Ubuntu 21.10), it does place files in ~/.wine but it doesn't show any GUI window, neither `wine64` 

Besides, Wine-7.0 from playonlinux works well with box86 on proot Termux, [LF2](https://lf2.net/) 1.9c playable smoothly. I would like to try wine-7.0 but I don't know how to manage RootFS with host FS in proot (Termux), as mentioned in another Github issue. 

More details for my setup:
> OS: proot Ubuntu 21.10, on Termux
> Display: software Mesa, KDE, Xvnc/TigerVNC, Android Desktop Mode

Error log is below. Can't provide a full log due to #1559 (too many unrelated warnings printed). 
I have GTK3 (i386 & amd64) and GTK2 (i386 & amd64) installed but CreateWindow. So what library do I miss or what else do I need? Thanks a lot!!
