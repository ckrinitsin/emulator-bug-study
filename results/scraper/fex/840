Wrap /proc/version to not leak host kernel information
This leaks kernel information. Which is why some applications are using too new of syscalls.
On my current x86 host this file contains 
```Linux version 5.10.0-14-generic (buildd@lcy01-amd64-009) (gcc (Ubuntu 10.2.1-6ubuntu2) 10.2.1 20210121, GNU ld (GNU Binutils for Ubuntu) 2.36) #15-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 29 15:10:03 UTC 2021```
