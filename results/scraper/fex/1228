Guest signal handling should be setup to use rt_sigreturn
Currently we setup using a unique instruction for returning from a guest signal handler.
We should instead use the "correct" setup of using the handler restorer.
This will grant us support for guest applications using the restorer and we can drop usage of a custom instruction here.

With the movement of the guest signal frame moving from FEXCore to FEXLoader, this will become easier to support.
Since the signal frame setup needs to be understood on both sides.
