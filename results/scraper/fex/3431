GDB stub non-functional due to regression
Merging #3321 regressed the GDB stub functionality: FEXLoader will now crash once gdb connects to it (or gdb itself hangs due to protocol errors).

To reproduce, run `FEXLoader -G <any x86_64 executable>` and then run the gdb command printed in the console (e.g. `gdb-multiarch -ex "target extended-remote /run/user/1000/FEX_gdbserver/650259-gdb"`).
