FEXCore: steam hangs at startup with one thread at 100%  
Howdy!

I am running Steam with FEX-2412 on muvm ~0.1.4~ 0.1.3-r1 on M1 Max.

Steam keeps hanging at startup with one thread running constantly at 100%. I was bisecting the release till merge commit 41c8731443a08141e09ce9941921ca792bdf0bb4 (https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/pull/4188). 9febddefa3b8f8334e3f8d8b9f7cb979358b48c8 works well. 

```bash
/usr/bin/muvm -- FEXInterpreter /home/n3ph/.local/share/fex-steam/steam-launcher/bin_steam.sh -cef-force-occlusion -cef-force-opaque-backgrounds

The XKEYBOARD keymap compiler (xkbcomp) reports:
