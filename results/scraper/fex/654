Steam slow to initialize due to interpreter
During steam initialization it spends about 70% of CPU time in the interpreter. This will be because of x87 fallback.
We need to isolate the hot blocks and force implement the ops necessary to get these running in the JITs.

After initialization it looks to be sitting at anywhere from 5-15% interpreter time which is still a significant chunk of time.
