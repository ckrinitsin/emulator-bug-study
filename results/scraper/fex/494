Buildbot LoadCI integration
LoadCI integration is a time consuming process. List of steps we need to support.


**Step 1**
- [ ] Switch CI system over to buildbot
  - [ ] Show buildbot steps in in Github view
  - [ ] Block merge when buildbot not ran (When not authenticated)
  - [ ] Allow Admin CI running via comment
  - [ ] Show results of LoadCI in comment
    - [ ] Block merging when performance has degraded
    - [ ] Allow manual override (Only authenticated users)
- [ ] Github event notification
  - [ ] Authentication check with buildbot group
  - [ ] LoadCI message stating changed performance on 
  - [ ] Only merge LoadCI results to Postgres on main master merge

**Step 2**
- [ ] Discord integration
  - [ ] Show failures against main branch in bots channel
  - [ ] Kick off PR build directly from bots channel (Only authenticated users)

**Step 3**
- [ ] Load balancing / Job splitting
  - [ ] Every builder must build its own instance of FEX
  - [ ] Create runner families that should closely match performance to one another
  - [ ] Split LoadCI jobs to runner families
