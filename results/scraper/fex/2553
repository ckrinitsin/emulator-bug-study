To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Usage examples:
# steam is a bash script. Wrap with FEXBash
        FEXBash steam
# Full path execution execution will wrap the application if it exists in the rootfs
        FEXInterpreter /usr/bin/uname
# Freestanding x86/x86-64 programs can be executed directly. binfmt_misc will redirect to FEX
        $HOME/PetalCrashOnline.AppImage
# If you need a terminal that emulates everything.
# Run FEXBash without arguments. Double check uname to see if running under FEX
