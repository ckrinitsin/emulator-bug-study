early virtio console output is lost

This is broken in git and reportedly in 2.5 through 2.7.

Running a Linux kernel which includes a testsuite in initrd sometimes produces no output.

Reportedly the console is sometimes not open when the early userspace tries to log output resulting in either the testsuite terminating early or not writing the output.

Workaround patch is here:

reportedly you would get -EBADF there when no output is generated.

Also this reportedly happens with virtio console only, not virtio serial port.

It seems that the author of said testsuite did not report the problem so I write it down so it does not get lost.

test (in bash):

n=0 ; while [ $n -lt 100 ] && grep -m 1 -F "WireGuard Test Suite on Linux 4.8.6" <( /opt/qemu/bin/qemu-system-x86_64         -nodefaults         -nographic         -machine q35,accel=kvm         -cpu host         -smp 2         -m 64M         -object rng-random,id=rng0,filename=/dev/urandom         -device virtio-rng-pci,rng=rng0         -device virtio-serial,max_ports=2         -chardev stdio,id=stdio         -device virtconsole,chardev=stdio         -chardev file,id=status,path=result.txt         -device virtserialport,chardev=status         -monitor none         -kernel wireguard-testing-harness-bzImage-e87cb2a7-145c-4985-907f-17e81fae329b         -append "console=hvc0 initcall_debug=1 loglevel=7" ) ; do echo $n ; n=$(expr $n + 1) ; pkill -f wireguard ; done

This typically does 10-20 iterations but sometimes tens of iterations run without issue.
