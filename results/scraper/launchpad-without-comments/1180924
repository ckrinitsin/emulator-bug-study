fails to handle a usb serial port with a specific vendorid

If I run qemu-system-i386 with arguments
-usb -usbdevice serial:vendorid=1221:pty
(this is what the documentation says about how I shoud add a usb device which has a serial port interface and which has a specific vendor id, I used the documentation located here:
http://qemu.weilnetz.de/qemu-doc.html
), it says 
char device redirected to /dev/pts/<something> (label usbserial0)
qemu-system-i386: -usbdevice serial:vendorid=1221:pty: Property '.vendorid' not found
Aborted
and exits. Moreover, if I try to add such a device to a running machine by typing usb_add serial:vendorid=1221:pty in the machine's control terminal (to reach it, I press ctrl-alt-2), qemu also writes 
char device redirected to /dev/pts/<something> (label usbserial0)
Aborted
to the terminal where I run it from and exits. To the quest OS this looks like a power failure which causes all the programs inside the virtual machine to lose their unsaved data.
I have tested this with qemu-1.5.0-rc2, actually, the issue occured in a similar way since 1.0.1, but did not occur in 0.11.1.
The issue is reproducible always, even if I don't specify any hard disk in the command line, i. e.
$ qemu-system-i386 -usb -usbdevice serial:vendorid=1221:pty
, so I believe it is guest OS -independent.
