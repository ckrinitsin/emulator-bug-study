copy-paste between client and host

Hi,

I propose that copy/paste between VMs be implemented somehow directly in QEMU.
This has been discussed repeatedly elsewhere; various solutions are proposed.  See below.

As it is, each user has to do their own research and testing if they are to find a solution.   This makes the product frustratingly unattractive for many.

Most solutions involve either running vnc and using a vnc client that supports copy/paste (this can be tricky to find itself), or running some other tcp-based copy-paste application. 

For many users, the networking in a client VM is unimportant--they just want to run some application there, and setting up netoworking in a VM itself can be an issue.  Most of these solutions rely on un-maintained software, and some require that other software be installed to make them work (Basic interpreter, Java, etc).  Any of these solutions take some work to set up.

I can tell you, the absence of a copy/paste mechanism makes the project an immediate no-go for many users.  I work with a guy who spent a lot of time trying, gave up, and switched to VirtualBox for this exact reason.

It would be much better if copy/paste worked out of the box.  Ideally, it should work independently of networking.

Cheers!
