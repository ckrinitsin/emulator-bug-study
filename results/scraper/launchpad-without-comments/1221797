virt-install gets stuck during downloading install.img

I have tried to install CentOS 6.4 using the latest version of all kvm related tools. My problem is that I get stuck at arround 20% during the download of the file install.img. Everything before that works just fine.

I am using the following commands to install to server:
virt-install \
	-n test \
	-r 1024 \
	--disk path=/var/kvm/images/test.img,size=25 \
	--vcpus=1 \
	--os-type linux \
	--os-variant=rhel6 \
	--network bridge=br2 \
	--nographics \
	--location='http://mirror.netcologne.de/centos/6.4/os/x86_64' \
	--extra-args='console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 serial' \

I have checked that my server is ready for virtualization.

If you need any further information I am happy to provide them
