cmos RTC alarms no longer wake system from suspend

Running QEMU emulator version 2.0.0 (Debian 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.1), booting Linux kernels with qemu-system-x86_64 and qemu-system-i386, I no longer see the system resume from suspend when an RTC alarm is set.

My simple test application can be found here:

Previously this worked w/ QEMU 1.5  (bascially up until I upgraded from Ubuntu 13.10 to Ubuntu 14.04, which came with 2.0).
