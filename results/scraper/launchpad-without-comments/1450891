VM will not resume on GlusterFS

oVirt uses libvirt to run QEMU.
Images are passed to QEMU as files, not file descriptors.
When running images from a GlusterFS, the file descriptors may get invalidated because of network problems or the glusterfs process being restarted.
In this case, the VM goes into paused state.
When trying to resume the VM ('cont' command), QEMU uses the same invalidated file descriptors throwing a:
"block I/O error in device 'drive-virtio-disk0': Transport endpoint is not connected (107)".

Please check file-descriptors and reopen image file on 'cont' event in QEMU.
Thanks.
