Possible regression in QEMU 5.0.0 after CVE-2020-10702 (segmentation fault)

I've come across a very specific situation, but I'm sure it could be replicated in other cases.

In QEMU 5.0.0 when I use user emulation with a cURL binary for aarch64 and connect to a server using TLS 1.2 and ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 cypher a segmentation fault occurs.

I attach a Dockerfile that reproduces this crash and the strace output with and without the de0b1bae6461f67243282555475f88b2384a1eb9 commit reverted.
