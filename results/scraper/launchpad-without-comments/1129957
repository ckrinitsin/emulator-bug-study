Performance issue running quest image on qemu compiled for Win32 platform

I'm seeing performance issues when booting a guest image on qemu 1.4.0 compiled for the Win32 platform.
The same image boots a lot faster on the same computer running qemu/linux on Fedora via VmWare, and even running the Win32 exectuable via Wine performs better than running qemu natively on Win32.

Although I'm not the author of the image, it is located here:

All testing has been done on QEMU 1.4.0.

I'm also attaching a couple of gprof logs. For these I have disabled ssp in qemu by removing "-fstack-protector-all" and "-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2" from the qemu configure script.
