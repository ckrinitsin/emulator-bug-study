CentOS guest crashing due to assertion failure in qemu-char.c

Here is the log in /var/log/libvirt/qemu/centos_heavy.log

qemu-kvm: /builddir/build/BUILD/qemu-kvm-0.12.1.2/qemu-char.c:630: io_watch_poll_finalize: Assertion `iwp->src == ((void *)0)' failed.
2014-01-13 16:50:31.576+0000: shutting down

The code it's failing the assertion on has an interesting comment:

    static void io_watch_poll_finalize(GSource *source)
    {
    /* Due to a glib bug, removing the last reference to a source
    * inside a finalize callback causes recursive locking (and a
    * deadlock). This is not a problem inside other callbacks,
    * including dispatch callbacks, so we call io_remove_watch_poll
    * to remove this source. A t this point, iwp->src must
    * be NULL, or we would leak it.
    *
    * This would be solved much more elegantly by child sources,
    * but we support older glib versions that do not have them.
    */
    IOWatchPoll *iwp = io_watch_poll_from_source(source);
    assert(iwp->src == NULL);
    }
