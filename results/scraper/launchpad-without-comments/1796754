ioctl SIOCGIFCONF causes qemu-aarch64-static to crash with "received signal outside vCPU context"

To reproduce it, compile the attached crash.c under aarch64 to a.out and execute on x86_64
qemu-aarch64-static ./a.out

It will print the following and crash:

socket=3
qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0x60038cd6
qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=0x6000157a

The version of qemu-aarch64-static is

qemu-aarch64 version 3.0.0 (qemu-3.0.0-1.fc29)

But it did also happen in previous versions so it is not a regression but a bug existed ever since.
