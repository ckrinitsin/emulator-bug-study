qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom -nographic gives no output

Running 'sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048M -cpu host -cdrom github/xvisor-bootable.iso -boot d -enable-kvm' will create a qemu window, boot to a grub prompt and then boot the xvisor binary correctly.

Once I append -nographic to the command - after the user has selected the grub boot binary, there is no further output.

I've tried various permutations with qemu options, but to no avail. It would be great to have this working as it will permit scrolling back up into the command history for reference and large data output.

QEMU emulator version 5.2.50 (v5.2.0-925-g7b09f12773)
