PCI broken in qemu ppc e500 in v2.12.0 and other versions

The same qemu -M mpc... command that works on qemu-system-ppc version 2.8.0 freezes guest on bootup and shows error for qemu-system-ppc version 4.2.0release and 4.19dirtygit:

qemu-system-ppc: virtio-blk failed to set guest notifier (-24), ensure -accel kvm is set.
qemu-system-ppc: virtio_bus_start_ioeventfd: failed. Fallback to userspace (slower).

ends/freezes at:

I'm using -drive file=/home/me/rawimage.dd,if=virtio and works fine in version 2.8.0 installed with apt-get install (Ubuntu 17.04) and also with 2.8.0 official release from git/github that I compiled/built myself. But both of the newer releases fail on the same exact machine same config.

I also noticed that qemu-2.8.0 was fine with mtd but the newer ones I tried weren't, ie gave
qemu-system-ppc: -drive if=mtd: machine type does not support if=mtd,bus=0,unit=0
(but I removed -drive if=mtd since wasn't using it anyway)

I also tried on windows but I think virtio doesn't work on windows hosts at all? On windows host it fails the same way, even version 2.12 as well as 4.1.10...

used:
./configure --prefix=/opt/... --enable-fdt --enable-kvm --enable-debug

(basically all steps the same on same exact system same config, yet 2.8.0 works fine whether apt-get installed or built from source while the others I built, 4.19/4.2.0 or 2.12/4.1.10(win) don't.)

In case newer qemu versions act weird on various kernels, I did try with both vmlinuz-4.10.0-19-generic and vmlinuz-4.13.12-041312-generic (I didn't compile them but I can provide config-..files)
