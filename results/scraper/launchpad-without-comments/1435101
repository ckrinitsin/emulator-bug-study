Windows, QEMU 2.2.50 fails to boot XP CD

Running XP Pro SP3 host 32bit.  When I launch qemu booting from CD, it fails to complete load, getting stuck at "Setup is starting Windows". It does not proceed past. I tried to disable floppy but still no go. Download older version 1.5.1-win32, 0.9.1, same problem. 
qemu-system-i386w.exe -cdrom "d:\XP.ISO" -hda d:\xp.img -boot d 
with -global isa-fdc.driveA=c or -no-fd-bootchk switches but no go. I see others have run into this problem as well but no real solutions. Some folks says turning off floppy works and I tried.
