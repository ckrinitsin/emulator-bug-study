Please provide an option to print the default hardware configuration as command-line options, to make -nodefaults easier to use

For full customization of the default set of hardware qemu supports, a user can pass -nodefaults and then manually specify each device they want.  Many specific options document what they translate to in terms of the full configuration model; however, the defaults for any given platform don't.

I'd love to have documentation of the default hardware configuration, in terms of qemu command-line options, to make it easy to run qemu -nodefaults, paste in the default command-line, and edit it.

As this varies by emulated machine, perhaps qemu could have a command-line option to print a specific machine (e.g. pc-i440fx-2.5) in the form of qemu command-line options?
