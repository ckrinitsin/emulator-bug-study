websockets: Improve error messages 

Since 2.9 / 07e95cd529af345fdeea230913f68eff5b925bb6 , whenever the VNC websocket server finds an error with the incoming connection request, it just closes the socket with no further information.

This makes figuring out what's wrong with the request nearly impossible.

I would be nice if:

* HTTP 400 were returned to the client, with an appropriate error message
* Maybe something written to the log as well?

Currently, I'm resorting to looking at my request and the websocket source and hoping I can figure out what's wrong.
