qemu-system-sparc MUTEX_HELD assert and libC lock errors

Here I am cross-posting a comment I made on Artyom's blog.  Atar responded that he "fixed these issues for some customers".  I hoped that opening a bug to the opensource project might help develop the solution for the public domain.

I now have a mostly-working Solaris 6 emulation, with great thanks to the valuable information in Artyom's blog, brezular.com, and the QEMU/Solaris 4.14 wikibook.

setup detail;
QEMU (present git snapshot, reports --version 2.2.92)
-M SS-20, openboot/proprietary prom

# uname -a
SunOS emu0 5.6 Generic_105181-33 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20

I continue to have a problem, which I have found others posted in blog comments, but have not seen a resolution yet.

# /etc/init.d/init.dmi start
Run-time error, libC:
Trying to release a lock that was not acquired in this thread
(repeat above 1x)
Abort - core dumped

as well as:
Assertion failed: MUTEX_HELD(&svc_mutex), file rpc/svc_run.c, line 766

which prints to the console periodically when "dmispd" is running.
