powernv machine complains of missing skiboot files

Hi, I want to use the powernv machine from the qemu-system-ppcle application. However, when I specify this machine, qemu complains that it can't find the skiboot files.

I noticed that skiboot is available for Ubuntu, but only for the PPC[64] hosts. Well, I just need skiboot files for qemu on amd64 hosts.

Hmm, looks like Debian has a package for these missing qemu files:

https://packages.debian.org/sid/qemu-skiboot

Could we promote these to Ubuntu repositories, and fix the qemu packages so that they automatically depend on the necessary BIOS packages? For example, openbios-ppc should also be installed when qemu-system-ppc[64[le]] are installed.
