qemu-kvm-0.14.0 + kernel 2.6.35 : win2008r2 virtio nic hanging

Hi,

I'm a proxmox distrib user,

I have network error with virtio nic cards in win2008r2sp1 server, only with qemu 0.14 and 2.6.35 kernel combination.

after some network transferts (can be 2mb or 500mb), nic doesn't respond anymore. only way is to reboot.

e1000 driver working fine.

revert back to qemu 0.13+ 2.6.35 kernel works fine  or qemu 0.14 + 2.6.32 kernel is working fine too.

i'm using virtio nic drivers 1.1.16 from http://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/virtio-win/latest/images/bin/

i had also tried the virtio-win-prewhql-0.1-7-nic.tar.gz from https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=630830#c26

i'm not the only proxmox user ,more users reports here :

i've also see that a slackware user with winxp guest has the same problem

I can help to debug if it's possible to have logs somewhere .....
