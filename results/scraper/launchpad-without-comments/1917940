-bios edk2-$arch-code doesn't work for x86

Whilst creating a flash device is recommended, -bios <file> is extremely useful in many cases as it automatically searches $PREFIX/share/qemu rather than requiring the caller (be it a human or a script) to work out where that directory is for the QEMU being called and prepend it to the file name.

Currently, all the x86 EDK2 FD code files are 3653632 bytes in size, or 0x37c000 bytes. However, for some reason I cannot find the answer to (I traced the code back to 7587cf44019d593bb12703e7046bd7738996c55c), x86's -bios only allows files that are multiples of 64K in size (x86_bios_rom_init), which would require the EDK2 ROMs to be rounded up to 0x380000 bytes. If I delete the check, QEMU is able to load the only-16K-multiple-sized EDK2 and boot an OS just fine. If I pad EDK2 with 16K of zeroes at the *start* (since the ROM gets mapped counting backwards), it also works just fine (but padding at the *end* doesn't). Please therefore either relax the check in x86_bios_rom_init or ensure the EDK2 binary is suitably padded.
