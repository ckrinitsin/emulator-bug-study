Virtual Disk with over 16TB 

Hi,

is there a option to create a disk for a vm with a size over 16TB. 

the problem that after the diskfile reach 16TB, the disk get a state of read-only at this limit.
I know, that 16TB file size is max, is there a option to create the disk in mutliple files?
we want to use 22 TB. in the VM 

To attach a partition directly to the vm, is not what we want to do.

best regards

Chris
