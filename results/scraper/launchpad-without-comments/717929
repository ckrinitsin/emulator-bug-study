Serial communication between VMs problematic

Hello,

I want to setup serial communication between VM hosts but I have found it quite difficult...:

...because when trying unix sockets:

- host A has serial device as unix socket (bind)
- host B has serial device as client of unix socket
- host A is down thus not unix socket does exist
- host B can't be started because cannot read the socket:

error: Failed to start domain opd1s02
error: internal error Process exited while reading console log output: char device redirected to /dev/pts/0
connect(unix:/tmp/test.sock): Connection refused
chardev: opening backend "socket" failed

Can that work like the cable is not plugged in? So host B can start and when the socket would exist it would connect to it?

...and when using pty and host device combination one cannot predict pty device under /dev/pts, it would be nice if would be possible to define exact device name.

Tested on Fedora 14.
