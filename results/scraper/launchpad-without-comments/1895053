Cannot nspawn raspbian 10 [FAILED] Failed to start Journal Service.

Hi, I'm using nspawn and asked the question @systemd-devel. They redirected me to you, guessing that nspawn calls a syscall or ioctl qemu isnt aware of and can't implement properly?
They were like: "Sorry, that's not my department." ^^

Maybe you can reproduce the issue or help me investigating whats wrong or put the ball right back into their court? :D
