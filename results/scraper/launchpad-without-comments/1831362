European keyboard PC-105 deadkey

With a freshly compiled version of qemu 4.0.50 on Windows 10 (host)

I am using 3 different Belgian keyboards and I have the same behaviour
- 2 USB keyboards (Logitech and HP) and
- the keyboard of my laptop (HP)

3 characters on the same key cannot be used (the key seams to be dead):
< (less than),
> (greater than) used with the combination of LShift or RShift
\ (backslash) used with the combination of AltGr

Using grub command mode from an archlinux installation (5.1.4)
The keyboard seams to be a mix of azerty and qwerty keyboard
all letters are correctly mapped but all numbers and special
characters are not

Using sendkey in monitor
"sendkey <" results in : \
"sendkey shift-<" results in : |
"sendkey ctrl-alt-<" results in : nothing

REM: VirtualBox can handle this key and with the showkey command
     from the archlinux kbd package, it shows :
     keycode 86 press
     keycode 86 release
