RISC-V incorrect exception generated

When using 'ecall' from supervisor mode, user exception is raised instead of supervisor exception. The problem is located under 'target/riscv/insn_trans/trans_priviledged.inc.c' in function 'static bool trans_ecall(DisasContext *ctx, arg_ecall *a)'. Best regards, Serge Teodori
