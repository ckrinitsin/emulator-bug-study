qemu doesn't stop execution upon hitting a breakpoint

Using Qemu 0.12.3 and gdb 7.1 on Ubuntu Lucid.

I'm trying to debug some bootloader code. Using qemu -s -S to run the bootloader and gdb to connect to qemu, I set the breakpoint at 0x7c00. Then I type continue in gdb. The breakpoint is hit and gdb shows debug information. However qemu apparently continues to execute the code of the bootloader as the text is printed on the screen etc.
