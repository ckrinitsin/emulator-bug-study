qemu 1.4.2: usb keyboard not fully working

When using the usb keyboard, I can't type the | character. I'm using german keyboard layout (de) on the host and inside the guest. As a guest OS, I use Linux (e.g. a recent KNOPPIX cd). To obtain the | character on a german keyboard, I need to press AltGr + the < or > key, i.e. the key right to the left shift.

The qemu command line is something like this:
./qemu-system-i386 -device pci-ohci -device usb-kbd
I also tried
./qemu-system-i386 -usb -usbdevice keyboard
with the same effect.
