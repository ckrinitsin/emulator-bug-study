ARM: tag bits cleared in FAR_EL1

The ARM Architecture Reference Manual provides the following for FAR_EL1:

"For a Data Abort or Watchpoint exception, if address tagging is enabled for the address accessed by the data access that caused the exception, then this field includes the tag."

However, I have found that the tag bits in FAR_EL1 are always clear, even if the tag bits were set in the original access.

I can reproduce the problem on both 4.1.1 and master (6e8a73e911f066527e775e04b98f31ebd19db600).
