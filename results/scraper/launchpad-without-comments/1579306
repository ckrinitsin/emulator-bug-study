usb-uas does not work in Windows (10) guest

When I attach a "-device usb-uas" to a VM with Windows 10 10586, the device fail to start with the following error in the guest:

"The device cannot start. (Code 10)

{Operation Failed}
The requested operation was unsuccessful"

If the host controller is nec-usb-xhci, there will be two of the following error on the terminal of the host as well:

"qemu-system-x86_64: usb_uas_handle_control: unhandled control request"

If it's usb-ehci, ich9-usb-ehci1 or ich9-usb-echi2, this will not show up on the host side, but the device stil fails with the same error on the guest side.
