qemu-system-sparc stucked while booting using ss20_v2.25_rom 

I cannot boot up OBP using the current (5.1) version of qemu with ss20_v2.25_rom. It just stuck at "Power-ON reset" and hanged.  However using the previous version from 2015 I can successfully both up the OBP. 

qemu-system-sparc -M SS-20 -m 256 -bios ss20_v2.25.rom -nographic

Power-ON Reset

(*hang)
