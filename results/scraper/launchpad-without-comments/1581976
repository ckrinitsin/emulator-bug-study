man qemu contains a bug in description of "-virtfs" command line argument

The description of command line argument looks like this:

 -virtfs
       fsdriver[,path=path],mount_tag=mount_tag[,security_model=security_model][,writeout=writeout][,readonly][,socket=socket|sock_fd=sock_fd]


note, that there is no "id" attribute in the list of parameters.

later on the man there the "id" attribute is documented, as it were present:

           id=id
               Specifies identifier for this device

i think that it was copied from above section (about "-fsdev") without reviewing.
