RFE: Allow specifying usb-host device by serial number

Currently you can pass through a host USB device to the guest like

  -device usb-host,vendorid=0x1234,productid=0x5678

Which is all well and good, but has problems if you are trying to assign to identical USB devices to the same guest.

It would be useful if there was an additional option that allow matching against the device's serial number, which should allow differentiating between two devices with the same product+vendor.
