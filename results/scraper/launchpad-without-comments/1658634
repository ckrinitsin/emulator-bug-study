Can't get correct display with latest QEMU and OVMF BIOS

I tried to install a Ubuntu 16.04.1 Desktop 64bits with latest QEMU and OVMF UEFI BIOS, however I can't get correct display output with default vga configuration (-vga std). However, qemu works with a couple of different configurations:
1. "-vga cirrus" + "-bios OVMF.fd": works
2. "-vga std" + non-UEFI bios: works

The same error with QEMU 2.8.0 release. Everything works well on 2.7.0/1.
