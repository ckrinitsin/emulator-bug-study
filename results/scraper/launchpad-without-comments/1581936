Frozen Windows 7 VMs with VGA CVE-2016-3712 fix (2.6.0 and 2.5.1.1)

Hi,

As already posted on the QEMU devel list [1] I stumbled upon a problem with QEMU in version 2.5.1.1 and 2.6.0.

the VM shows Windows loading
files for the installation, then the "Starting Windows" screen appears
here it hangs and never continues.

Changing the "-vga" option to cirrus solves this, the installation can
proceed and finish. When changing back to std (or also qxl, vmware) the
installed VM also hangs on the "Starting Windows" screen while qemu
showing a little but no excessive load.

This phenomena appears also with QEMU 2.6.0 but not with 2.6.0-rc4, a
git bisect shows fd3c136b3e1482cd0ec7285d6bc2a3e6a62c38d7 (vga: make
sure vga register setup for vbe stays intact (CVE-2016-3712)) as the
culprit for this regression, as its a fix for a DoS its not an option to
just revert it, I guess.

The bisect log is:

I could reproduce that with QEMU 2.5.1 and QEMU 2.6 on a Debian derivate
(Promox VE) with 4.4 Kernel and also with QEMU 2.6 on an Arch Linux
System with a 4.5 Kernel, so it should not be host distro depended. Both
machines have Intel x86_64 processors.
The problem should be reproducible with said Versions or a build from
git including the above mentioned commit (fd3c136) by starting a VM with
an Windows 7 ISO, e.g.:

Freezing installation (as vga defaults to std I marked it as optional):
./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -boot d -cdrom win7.iso -m 1024 [-vga (std|qxl|vmware)]

Working installation:
./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -boot d -cdrom win7.iso -m 1024 -vga cirrus

If someone has already an installed Windows 7 VM this behaviour should be
also observable when trying to start it with the new versions of QEMU.

Noteworthy may be that Windows 10 is working, I do not had time to get
other Windows versions and test them, I'll do that as soon as possible.
Various Linux system also seems do work fine, at least I did not ran
into an issue there yet.

I also tried testing with SeaBIOS and OVMF as firmware, as initially I
had no idea what broke, both lead to the same result - without the 
CVE-2016-3712 fix they both work, with not.
Further, KVM enabled and disabled does not make any difference.
