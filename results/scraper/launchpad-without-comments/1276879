lots of dma command 10, 14 not supported

Trying to install NeXTSTEP 3.3 onto a 2GB file with QEMU 1.7.0.
In the terminal that started QEMU, there are a lot of
    dma: command 10 not supported
and 
    dma: command 14 not supported
messages.  When the installation of NeXTSTEP gets to
'preparing disk for nextstep installation', there are a lot
of messages that ATA command c5 failed and other info.
The result is a failed installation.

Is this a bug in QEMU?  Is there a workaround, e.g. by
disabling DMA altogether?

thank you
