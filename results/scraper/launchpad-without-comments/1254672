ps segfaults with qemu-{arm,armel,mips,powerpc}-static

Host: Ubuntu Precise AMD64
Guest: Debian Testing armhf

After running a debootstrap for Debian testing/armhf and entering the chroot, simply running "ps" causes a segmentation fault.

$ sudo qemu-debootstrap --arch=armhf testing armhf http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/
[...]
$ sudo chroot armhf
# ps
Signal 11 (SEGV) caught by ps (procps-ng version 3.3.4).
/bin/ps:display.c:59: please report this bug

I couldn't find a bug report for procps, which would be unusual if such a bug existed, so I'm assuming the bug is in qemu.

Unfortunately trying to run debootstrap for an Ubuntu variant fails to find the release file.

ps is used a lot, as you can imagine, but specifically it fails when trying to install some packages via "apt-get install" and no attempt is made to recover.
