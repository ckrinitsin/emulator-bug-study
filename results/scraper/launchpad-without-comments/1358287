-readconfig file doesn't interpret memory size correctly

I'm running Qemu 2.1 and have issues with the config file format.

Specifically Qemu wrote the following snippet with '-writeconfig':

[memory]
  size = "1024"

However, upon starting a VM with this setting it only receives 128MiB (the default size).

I'm reverting back to using the command line option now - that works.
