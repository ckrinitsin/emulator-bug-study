qemu-i386 under aarch64: Segfaulting on Steamcmd

I am trying to set up a Valheim server on my Raspberry Pi. I have installed the aarch64 image of Arm Arch Linux.

I installed qemu-user-static from the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qemu-user-static/
I have correctly set up binfmt support: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/binfmt-qemu-static-all-arch/

This allows me to successfully run i386 and amd64 docker images:

[alarm@server ~]$ sudo docker run --rm i386/debian uname -a
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/386) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested
Linux 9fd8d345b0aa 5.11.1-1-ARCH #1 SMP Tue Feb 23 20:00:47 MST 2021 i686 GNU/Linux

and

[alarm@server ~]$ sudo docker run --rm amd64/debian uname -a
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested
Linux 4f50fd228ab6 5.11.1-1-ARCH #1 SMP Tue Feb 23 20:00:47 MST 2021 x86_64 GNU/Linux

However, when I try to run the docker image that is going to host the server, the download of Valheim never succeeds because the used steamcmd application segfaults:

The following command successfully runs the server: sudo docker run -d --name valheim-server -p 2456-2458:2456-2458/udp -e SERVER_NAME="My Server" -e WORLD_NAME="Neotopia" -e SERVER_PASS="secret" lloesche/valheim-server

However, when we look into the container's logs via this command: sudo docker logs valheim-server

We see the following entry in the log file: ./steamcmd.sh: line 38:    86 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) $DEBUGGER "$STEAMEXE" "$@"

This means that the download never completes, and therefor the Valheim server is never actually started. Any help would be much appreciated. If there is anything unclear or if you need more details, please let me know!
