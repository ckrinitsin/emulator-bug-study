mouse offset or invisible wall 2.11.0-3 

(There was another post, I'm not sure if it is related though. Also not sure if it's Arch related, I wouldn't be surprised as I normally use Gentoo and have less problems with Gentoo.)

When I grab the mouse in/out of the VM I tend to get an "invisible wall" half of the time.
I can push past if I fling the mouse through it but not if I slowly keep moving down.

The direction always seems to be down when I hit a wall (so a Y offset? maybe?)
This has been happening since at least version 2.10.

Not sure if "-alt-grab" has anything to do with it, that'd be my first guess.
