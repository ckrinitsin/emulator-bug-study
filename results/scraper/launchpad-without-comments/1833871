qemu-img convert file.vmdk: Invalid footer

Steps to reproduce
- Open ESXi 6.5 Web UI
- Export OVF
- qemu-img convert disk.vmdk disk.qcow2

Error:

    qemu-img: Could not open './disk-1.vmdk': Invalid footer

I found another person having this problem here:
https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/error-converting-vmdk-file-to-qcow2-file.38264/
As I guess from the answer, the guy went over to manually copy the flat file from the datastore instead of using the ovf-exported file.

Nevertheless, I think this bug should be investigated further and closed. Probably it is just some metadata issue and should not be too hard to fix once the root of the problem is found.
