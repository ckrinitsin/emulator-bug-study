qemu-img check failing on remote image in Eoan

The "qemu-img check" function is failing on remote (HTTP-hosted) images, beginning with Ubuntu 19.10 (qemu-utils version 1:4.0+dfsg-0ubuntu9). With previous versions, through Ubuntu 19.04/qemu-utils version 1:3.1+dfsg-2ubuntu3.5, the following worked:

$ /usr/bin/qemu-img check  http://10.193.37.117/cloud/eoan-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
No errors were found on the image.
19778/36032 = 54.89% allocated, 90.34% fragmented, 89.90% compressed clusters
Image end offset: 514064384

The 10.193.37.117 server holds an Apache server that hosts the cloud images on a LAN. Beginning with Ubuntu 19.10/qemu-utils 1:4.0+dfsg-0ubuntu9, the same command never returns. (I've left it for up to an hour with no change.) I'm able to wget the image from the same server and installation on which qemu-img check fails. I've tried several .img files on the server, ranging from Bionic to Eoan, with the same results with all of them.
