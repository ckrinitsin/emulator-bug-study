Feature Request:  Please add TCG OPAL 2 emulation support to the virtio disk emulation

In order to allow windows guests (and soon, linux guests) which are TCG OPAL 2 aware to perform disk encryption in a native fashion with hardware acceleration, please add TCG OPAL 2 emulation to the VIRTIO driver.  

Encryption should occur at the host level using any cryptographic facilities available to the host, for example AES-NI, Cryptography Hardware, underlying block device cryptography support where available or any other cryptography facility that may be developed and implemented in the future.
