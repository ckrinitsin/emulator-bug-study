qemu-kvm 2.7 does not boot kvm VMs with virtio on top of VMware ESX

After todays Proxmox update all my Linux VMs stopped booting.

# How to reproduce
- Have KVM on top of VMware ESX (I use VMware ESX 6)
- Boot Linux VM with virtio Disk drive.


# Result
virtio based VMs do not boot anymore:

root@demotuxdc:/etc/pve/nodes/demotuxdc/qemu-server# grep virtio0 100.conf 
bootdisk: virtio0
virtio0: pvestorage:100/vm-100-disk-1.raw,discard=on,size=20G

(initially with cache=writethrough, but that doesnÂ´t matter)

What happens instead is:

- BIOS displays "Booting from harddisk..."
- kvm process of VM loops at about 140% of Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6260U CPU @ 1.80GHz Skylake dual core CPU

Disk of course has valid bootsector:

root@demotuxdc:/srv/pvestorage/images/100# file -sk vm-100-disk-1.raw 
vm-100-disk-1.raw: DOS/MBR boot sector DOS/MBR boot sector DOS executable (COM), boot code
root@demotuxdc:/srv/pvestorage/images/100# head -c 2048 vm-100-disk-1.raw | hd | grep GRUB
00000170  be 94 7d e8 2e 00 cd 18  eb fe 47 52 55 42 20 00  |..}.......GRUB .|


# Workaround 1
- Change disk from virtio0 to scsi0
- Debian boots out of the box after this change
- SLES 12 needs a rebuilt initrd
- CentOS 7 too, but it seems that is not even enough and it still fails (even in hostonly="no" mode for dracut)


# Workaround 2
Downgrade pve-qemu-kvm 2.7.0-3 to 2.6.2-2.


# Expected results
Disk boots just fine via virtio like it did before.


# Downstream bug report
Downstream suggests an issue with upstream qemu-kvm:
