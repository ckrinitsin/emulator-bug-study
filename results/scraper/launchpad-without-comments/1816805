Cannot create cdrom device with open tray and cache option

When trying to create cdrom device with open tray and either of "cache" or "discard" options specified, I get the following error:

qemu-system-x86_64: -drive if=none,id=drive-ide0-0-0,readonly=on,cache=writeback,discard=unmap,throttling.iops-total=900: Must specify either driver or file

This bug essentially forbids live migration of VMs with open cdrom trays.

I was able to find the same bug at RedHat:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1338638

The bug was encountered in versions 2.5 and 2.11.
