[ARMv5] Integrator/CP regression when reading FPSID register

There seems to be a regression in QEMU 2.1.0 which demonstrates itself
when running the attached HelenOS Integrator/CP (i.e. ARMv5) image. The
offending instruction seems to be:

  vmrs r0, fpsid

Upon its execution, HelenOS kernel receives an Undefined instruction
exception (which it does not anticipate at that point) and crashes.

QEMU 2.0.0 was not affected by this issue.

Command line to reproduce with QEMU 2.1.0:

$ qemu-system-arm -M integratorcp -kernel image.boot -s -S &
$ /usr/local/cross/arm32/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-gdb 
...

End of assembler dump.


The Undefined instruction exception is not expected at this point when executing the VMRS r0,fpsid instruction.
