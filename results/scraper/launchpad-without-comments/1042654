Floppy disks and network not working on NT 3.1 on Qemu 1.2 rc1

When I try to put Floppy IMG/IMA/VFD images on NT 3.1 when it is running on Qemu 1.2 rc, they are not recognized and the network is not working even though I set it correctly (especially the AMD PCnet adapter)
Here's some screenshot of the floppy error:
