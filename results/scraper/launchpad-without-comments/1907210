QEMU gdbstub command "?" issue

I am using some third party GDB client, and I have noticed that every time "?" command is send from the client, QEMU gdbstub removes all break points. This behaviour is not expected since "?" command should only return stop reason.
Here is documentation from official gdb:
‘?’ Indicate the reason the target halted. The reply is the same as for step and
continue. This packet has a special interpretation when the target is in non-stop
mode; see Section E.10 [Remote Non-Stop], page 733.
Reply: See Section E.3 [Stop Reply Packets], page 693, for the reply specifications.

With some help on the irc, we have been able to pin point the failure point(in attachement file gdbstub.c).
Function that handles "?" command has this comment in it:
    /*
     * Remove all the breakpoints when this query is issued,
     * because gdb is doing an initial connect and the state
     * should be cleaned up.
     */
From which it is clear that developer that wrote that code assumed, that because most popular gdb client only uses "?" command at initial connect, it is safe to also remove all BPs. 
In my opinion initial connect should be detected in some other way, and not with "?" command.
