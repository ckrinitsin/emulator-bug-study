lack of keycode 89 for br-abnt2 keyboards

qemu-kvm-1.1.1
host system: slackware64-13.37
Bug detailed description:
Independent of Guest OS nothing happens when keycode 89 is pressed. 
If you select option "-k pt-br" at qemu commandline you get keycode 89 but there is no more keycode 26 (dead_acute dead_grave) and keycode 51 fails on "less" sign.
If you have a numeric keyboard you can use its "slash" key but there is no means to use the question mark, causing discomfort when you are scripting or programming.
