mips linux-user builds occasionly crash randomly only to be fixed by a full clean re-build

From time to time I find check-tcg crashes with a one of the MIPS binaries. The last time it crashed was running the test:

  ./mips64el-linux-user/qemu-mips64el ./tests/tcg/mips64el-linux-user/threadcount

Inevitably after some time noodling around wondering what could be causing this weird behaviour I wonder if it is a build issue. I wipe all the mips* build directories, re-run configure and re-build and voila problem goes away.

It seems there must be some sort of build artefact which isn't being properly re-generated on a build update which causes weird problems. Additional data point if I:

  rm -rf mips64el-linux-user
  ../../configure
  make

then I see failures in mip32 builds - eg:

    GEN     mipsn32el-linux-user/config-target.h
  In file included from /home/alex/lsrc/qemu.git/linux-user/syscall_defs.h:10,
                   from /home/alex/lsrc/qemu.git/linux-user/qemu.h:16,
                   from /home/alex/lsrc/qemu.git/linux-user/linuxload.c:5:
  /home/alex/lsrc/qemu.git/linux-user/mips64/syscall_nr.h:1: error: unterminated #ifndef
   #ifndef LINUX_USER_MIPS64_SYSCALL_NR_H

  make[1]: *** [/home/alex/lsrc/qemu.git/rules.mak:69: linux-user/linuxload.o] Error 1
  make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

which implies there is a cross dependency between different targets somewhere. If I executed:

  rm -rf mips*

before re-configuring and re-building then everything works again.
