since ubuntu 18 bionic release and latest, the ubuntu18 cloud image is unable to boot up on openstack instance 

Openstack Queens release which is running on ubuntu 18 LTS Controller and Compute.
Tried to boot up the instance via horizon dashboard without success.
Nova flow works perfect.
When access to console I discovered that the boot process stuck in the middle.
[[0;1;31m TIME [0m] Timed out waiting for device dev-vdb.device.
[[0;1;33mDEPEND[0m] Dependency failed for /mnt.
[[0;1;33mDEPEND[0m] Dependency failed for File System Check on /dev/vdb.
It receives IP but looks like not get configured at time.
since ubuntu 18 there is netplan feature managing the network interfaces
please advise.
