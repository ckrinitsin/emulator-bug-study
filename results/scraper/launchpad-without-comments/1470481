qemu-img converts large vhd files into only approx. 127GB raw file causing the VM to crash

I have a VHD file for Windows 2014 server OS. I use the following command to convert VHD file (20GB) to a RAW file for KVM.

qemu-img convert -f vpc -O raw WIN-SNRGCQV6O3O.VHD disk.img

The output file is about 127GB. When install the VM and boot it up, the OS crashes with STOP error after the intial screen. I found on the internet that the file limit of 127GB is an existing bug. Kindly fix the problem. The workaround to use a Hyper-V to convert to fixed disk is not a feasible solution.
