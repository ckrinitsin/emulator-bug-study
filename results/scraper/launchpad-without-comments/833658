Qemu ppc does not boot Debian 3.1r8

I tried booting the official image debian-31r8-powerpc-binary-1.iso with the following commandline:
qemu-system-ppc -boot d -cdrom ../debian-31r8-powerpc-binary-1.iso -hda hd.img. The booting process stops with CPU at 100%. I can choose to boot "install-2.4" or "install" which both hangs with the last output being "Loading ramdisk". I have also tried using the git-tree which crashes qemu with the message "qemu/memory.c:1183: memory_region_add_subregion_common: Assertion `!subregion->parent' failed." before even showing anything.

Additionally, qemu 0.14.1 shows the same behaviour but qemu 0.13 and 0.12.5 can boot beyond the "Loading ramdisk" message but stops immediatly afterwards with a messed up console window (letters are pushed into another, which makes them barely readable) when using "install". Also "install-2.4" boots with 0.13 and 0.12.5 beyond the "Loading ramdisk" message but stops with the last message being now "returning 0x01400000 from prom_init".
