Guest undefined when destroyed on host after migration 

After a live migration, guest VMs are being undefined from the host they were migrated to after shutdown. I have experienced this at two (2) separate locations on more than one hardware configuration.  This happens when utilizing virt-manager to view current allocations on hosts, and virsh on the CLI to migrate guests.  When the guest is migrated from one host to another, no errors are thrown, and only lose 1 packet from infinite ping. Shutting guest down *from* the guest OS results in the Guest VM being undefined on the residing host, and XML config lost.  If needed, I can provide a recorded session of this happening.

Thanks,
