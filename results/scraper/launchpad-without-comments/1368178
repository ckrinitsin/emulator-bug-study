Windows ME falsely detects qemu's videocards as Number Nine Imagine 128

A fresh installation of  Windows Millennium Edition (Windows ME, WinME) as guest OS on qemu interprets qemu's videocards as Number Nine Imagine  128 with the consequence, that 

1. It is impossible to change color depth.
2. WinME uses the i128.drv Driver that is shipped with WinMe.
3. Forcing WinME to use other drivers has no effect.


It also doesn't matter what option for -vga was given to QEMU at command line.
cirrus, std,   vmware,  qxl etc. all have no effect, the videocard detected by Windows Me stays at Number Nine Imagine 128.

Even selecting another driver in WinME and forcing WinME to use drivers such as the Cirrus Logic 5446 PCI driver has no effect.

I also want to mention, that the BIOS isn't detected by WinME properly.
The device manager of WinME shows errors with the Plug & Play BIOS driver BIOS.vxd.


That is the QEMU Version:

# qemu-system-i386 --version

And this was the complete command line, that was given: 
# sudo /usr/bin/qemu-system-i386 -hda WinME_QEMU.img -cdrom drivers.iso -boot c -no-acpi -no-hpet -soundhw sb16 -net nic -cpu pentium3 -m 256 -vga cirrus
