[Feature request] ia64-softmmu wanted

Qemu is missing support for full system emulation of the Itanium architecture, which is one of the main non-x86 server architectures today (despite the alleged decline in popularity). It would be really nice if someone had interest in adding full ia64 support to Qemu. Many OS projects could then use Qemu as the universal machine emulator for development and testing.

Note that there is an open source Ski simulator which can emulate an ia64 CPU, memory and a couple of Ski-specific devices, but the project seems inactive and the simulated machine is too simplified (no real devices, no real firmware). Moreover, it'd be better to have one tool such as Qemu for all architectures of interest rather than one per each architecture.
