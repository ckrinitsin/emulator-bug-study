qemu 1.3.0: usb devices shouldn't have same vendor/product ID and same serial

Boot Windows XP with
./qemu-system-i386 -device pci-ohci -device usb-tablet
and then with
./qemu-system-i386 -device pci-ohci -device usb-kbd

and you will notice, that the usb keyboard is not detected. In fact, Windows XP detects the usb tablet and loads the driver for the tablet instead of the driver for the keyboard.

The problem seems to be, that vendor and product ID and even the seriel of both the usb tablet and the usb keyboard are the same as an lsusb reveiles. Hence, Windows XP doesn't detect when you replace the tablet by a keyboard and vice versa. I didn't check other USB devices, but it seems a bad idea to me to have devices with the same vendor/product Id. I'm not aware, whether it is sufficient to change the seriel numbers of the devices.
