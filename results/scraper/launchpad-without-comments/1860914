QEMU prepends pathnames to command lines of Multiboot kernels and modules, contrary to the specification

When QEMU is launched with the -kernel option to boot a Multiboot image, the command line passed in the -append option is additionally prefixed the pathname of the kernel image and a space. Likewise, module command lines passed in the -initrd option are passed with the module pathname and a space prepended. At the very least the former is contary to what is prescribed in the Multiboot specification, version 0.6.96[0], which says in ยง3.3:

> General-purpose boot loaders should allow user a complete control on command line independently of other factors like image name.

With respect to module command lines, the spec is less clear, but GNU GRUB2 (the de facto reference implementation) does not prepend pathnames to command lines of either. I haven't tested GRUB legacy, but I assume it exhibits the same behaviour. It would be strange if passing pathnames was in fact intended; bootloader pathnames are useless to the loaded kernel, which may potentially have a completely different view of the file system from the bootloader.

Also, given that a kernel pathname may contain spaces, skipping it in the command line cannot be done reliably, while loading a Multiboot module from a pathname that contains spaces is outright impossible.

Found in 4.2.0, but latest git master apparently behaves the same.
