vnc server closed socket after arrow "down" keyevent

This is a rewrite for https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1670377

QEMU 2.6 or later
tigervncviwer 1.6  

Once get into grub boot interface(choose boot os, or recovery mode), keep pressing arrow down button for couple times, qemu will close the connection, vnc used zrle mode.

Interesting place:
1. when stopped at grub interface, only arrow up and down key could trigger it, 
2.  only in zrle or tight mode, could work well in raw mode
2. it only triggered by remote connection, not happen if local vncviewer and vnc server


A trace is attached.

Thanks
