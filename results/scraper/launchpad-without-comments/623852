PPC emulation loops on booting a FreeBSD kernel

Has anyone tried booting FreeBSD8.1-ppc under QEMU (Linux x86_64 host; PPC guest)?  I can get Linux/PPC to run fine, and FreeBSD8.1-i386 as well; but there seems to be a problem with whatever the FreeBSD8.1 kernel does, that QEMU's PPC emulation can't handle.

I am using the latest version of QEMU from GIT as of 25/8/10.  I don't know how to get a "git commit hash", so I can't quote it.

The kernel starts OK then loops after "Kernel entry at 0x100100 ...".

The command I am running is

qemu-system-ppc -cdrom FreeBSD-8.1-RELEASE-powerpc-disc1.iso -hda freebsd8.1-ppc -m 94 -boot d"

I obtained the kernel from ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/powerpc/ISO-IMAGES/8.1/FreeBSD-8.1-RELEASE-powerpc-disc1.iso.
