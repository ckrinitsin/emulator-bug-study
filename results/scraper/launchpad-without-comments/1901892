qemu-img create corrupts the qcow2 if the file already exists

When creating a disk using qemu-img create command, if the destination path of the qcow2 file already exists, it will show the error saying that it cannot get a lock so it exits with exit status 1 but it will corrupt the qcow2 file anyway.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Have a guest running with a root (vda) and a second device (vdc).
In my case is a clean Ubuntu 16.04 image with kernel 4.4.0-190-generic x86_64
vdc disk is called testadddisk-3.qcow2
2. vdc is an xfs over lvm.
pvcreacte /dev/vdc
vgcreate myVg /dev/vdc
lvcreate -l+100%FREE -n myLv myVg
mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/myVg-myLv
mount /dev/mapper/myVg-myLv /mnt
3. Create disk IO on that device in the guest.
while true ; do dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/testfile bs=1024 count=1000 ; sleep 1; done
4. Execute the command to create a new device but use the same name of the device attached:
sudo qemu-img create -f qcow2 testadddisk-3.qcow2 20G
The output of the command is this:
Formatting 'testadddisk-3.qcow2', fmt=qcow2 size=21474836480 cluster_size=65536 lazy_refcounts=off refcount_bits=16
qemu-img: testadddisk-3.qcow2: Failed to get "write" lock
Is another process using the image?

The write continues in the guest but when it is shutdown, when it is powered on again you get this:
error: Failed to start domain testadddisk
error: internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: 2020-10-27T22:00:51.628374Z qemu-system-x86_64: -drive file=/var/lib/vmImages/testadddisk-3.qcow2,format=qcow2,if=none,id=drive-virtio-disk2: Image is not in qcow2 format

I run the qemu-img create command with an strace and I believe that first it tries to open the file in write mode, then does a truncate on it and after that says it cannot get a lock. The output is in the file attached. As well as the guest xml just in case.
