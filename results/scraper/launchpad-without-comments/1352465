Can't install virtio block drivers during Windows setup

Hi!
Apparently there's no way to install the virtio block drivers during Windows setup, as they're simply not recognized by the installer when it looks for them on the CD drive.
The only way to setup virtio block drivers is to first install Windows on a IDE drive, then add a dummy virtio disk, then load the drivers and swap the two disks.
I'm using virtio-win-0.1-81.iso. I can confirm the issue with Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 7 Professional, 64 bit.
Thanks!
