empty qcow2

I plugged multiple qcow2 to a Windows guest. On the Windows disk manager all disks are listed perfectly, with their data, their real space, I even can explore all files on the Explorer, all cool

On third party disk manager (all of them), I only have the C:\ HDD who act normally, all the other plugged qcow2 are seen as fully unallocated, so I can't manipulate them

I want to move some partitions, create others, but on Windows disk manager I can't extend or create partition and on third party I didn't see the partitions at all

Even guestfs doesn't recognize any partition table `libguestfs: error: inspect_os: /dev/sda: not a partitioned device`
