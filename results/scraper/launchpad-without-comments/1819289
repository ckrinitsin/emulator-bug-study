Windows 95 and Windows 98 will not install or run

The last version of QEMU I have been able to run Windows 95 or Windows 98 on was 2.7 or 2.8. Recent versions since then even up to 3.1 will either not install or will not run 95 or 98 at all. I have tried every combination of options like isapc or no isapc, cpu pentium  or cpu as 486. Tried different memory configurations, but they just don't work anymore.
