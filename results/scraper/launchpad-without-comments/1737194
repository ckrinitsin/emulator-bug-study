Windows NT 4.0 fails to boot from qcow2 installation

Windows NT 4.0 will not boot from an installation more than once if installed in a qcow2 image file. A quick fix to this problem is to use the qcow format instead.

Steps to reproduce this issue:

Create the image file:
qemu-img create -f qcow2 winnt4.qcow2 1G

Boot from a Windows NT 4.0 Workstation CD:
qemu-system-i386 -hda winnt4.qcow2 -cdrom /dev/cdrom -boot d -m 128 -cpu pentium -vga cirrus

During the installation process you have the choise between FAT and NTFS. You can pick anyone.

After finishing the installation the guest will reboot to install additional items. Once this is done the guest will be bootable. Eject any CD media from QEMU and reboot. You will then see Windows NT 4.0 booting up to the desktop. Go to "Start->Shut down" to shut down. Then when Windows is ready quit QEMU. 

Now try to boot using this command:
qemu-system-i386 -hda winnt4.qcow2 -boot c -m 128 -cpu pentium -vga cirrus 
 
The BIOS screen will display an error message:

For NTFS: 
Booting from Hard Disk...
A disk read error occurred.
Insert a system diskette and restart
the system.

For FAT:
No bootable device.

Additional information:
qemu-system-i386 version: 2.10.1
qemu-img version: 2.10.92 (v2.11.0-rc4-dirty)
