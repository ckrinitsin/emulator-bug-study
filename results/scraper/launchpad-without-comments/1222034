QEMU + SPICE + AUDIO = FAILURE

Hello it's my first time doing this, since the major round of timer/block changes in August I have not been able to have audio working in any guest with the spice protocol.

64 bit linux , AMD SVM, IOMMUv1  M5A99X EVO R2.0


Example command line:

qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 -cdrom /common/stor8/torrents/Sabayon_Linux_DAILY_x86_Xfce.iso -soundhw hda -vga qxl -spice port=5999,addr=0.0.0.0,disable-ticketing  -enable-kvm



Any time the guest tries to access the emulated hardware it will hang for a very long period of time and play no audio through spice. 

This issue does not happen with the 1.6.0 release.


If you are unable to replicate this I will go to the trouble of getting the race message that happens in the guest but I am assuming at this point that my configuration is not exotic and it should be very easy to see the issue.
