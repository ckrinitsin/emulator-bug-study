illegal instructions for AArch64 ARMv8

The test case is in the attachment. To reproduce as following (I tried both GCC and Clang):
$aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc qemu.c -o test
$./test
qemu: uncaught target signal 4 (Illegal instruction) - core dumped
Illegal instruction (core dumped)

There are 3 intrinsics are tested in the test case: vqmovunh_s16,  vqmovuns_s32, vqmovund_s64. They will be compiled into instructions:
SQXTUN Bd, Hn
SQXTUN Hd, Sn
SQXTUN Sd, Dn.

It seems that these instructions are not supported in QEMU. Is this a bug?
