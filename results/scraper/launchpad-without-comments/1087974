[regression] vnc tight png produces garbled output

VNC Tight PNG compression did work fine two or three month ago but don't anymore. Now when Tight PNG is used parts of the desktop are shown but they are scrambled together.
I have always tested this feature against QEMU git with noVNC by only allowing Tight PNG compression.
