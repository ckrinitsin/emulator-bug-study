SD Card not working in Ubuntu 18.10 (CMD 2,3 timeout).  The device worked fine in Ubuntu 18.04 and earlier versions but not in Ubuntu 18.10

ARM PL181 MMC card no longer working in qemu-system-arm in Ubuntu 18.10
The MMC driver code worked fine in Ubuntu 15.10 to 18.04.
The command to run qemu-system-arm is

    qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 256M -sd sdimage -kernel t.bin -serial mon:stdio

During SDC initialization, SDC commands 2, 3, 9, 13, 7, 16 all timeout, 
which cause subsequent read/write commands 17/24 to fail also.

Tried both ARM versatilepb and realview-pb-a8, realview-pbx-a9 boards: all the same.
