bios_linker_loader_add_checksum: Assertion `start_offset < file->blob->len' failed

Trying boot/start a Windows 10 VM.  Worked until recently when this error started showing up.

I have the following installed on Fedora 33:
qemu-kvm-5.1.0-9.fc33.x86_64

This is the error:

Error starting domain: internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: qemu-system-x86_64: /builddir/build/BUILD/qemu-5.1.0/hw/acpi/bios-linker-loader.c:239: bios_linker_loader_add_checksum: Assertion `start_offset < file->blob->len' failed.

I see this were referenced in a patch from some time ago and supposedly fixed.  Here is the patch info I was able to find:
