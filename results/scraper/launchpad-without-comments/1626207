-device usb-host failing with usbip_vudc-vhdi_hcd gadget

I must admit that I do not know if this is a Qemu or a Kernel issue, but I try reporting here:

When I try to forward a copy of my USB mouse that I made with the new virtual USB device controller in kernel 4.7 I get the following in my log:
[  +0.703256] usb 1-4: reset full-speed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd
[  +1.020776] usb usb7-port3: Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?

[  +0.855005] usb usb7-port3: Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?
[  +0.000009] usb usb7-port3: unable to enumerate USB device

the commands I use for makeing the virtual device are(after making a copy of the report description of my real mouse in /root/usb/kingston_report_desc):
        mkdir /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/winmouse
        cd /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/winmouse
        echo "0x047d" > idVendor
        echo "0x1020" > idProduct
        mkdir strings/0x409
        echo 2016 > strings/0x409/serialnumber
        echo Kensington > strings/0x409/manufacturer
        echo "Kensington Expert Mouse" > strings/0x409/product
        mkdir configs/c.1
        mkdir configs/c.1/strings/0x409
        mkdir functions/hid.usb2
        echo 2 > functions/hid.usb2/protocol
        echo 1 > functions/hid.usb2/subclass
        echo 4 > functions/hid.usb2/report_length
        cat /root/usb/kingston_report_desc > functions/hid.usb2/report_desc
        echo 0xa0 > configs/c.1/bmAttributes
        echo 100 > configs/c.1/MaxPower

        ln -s functions/hid.usb2 configs/c.1
        echo usbip-vudc.2 > UDC

        usbip attach -r localhost -d usbip-vudc.2

The virtual mouse then shows up as Bus7,Dev10 and I use the option -device usb-host,hostbus=7,hostaddr=10,id=hostdev6,bus=usb.0,port=2 in Qemu to attach it.

This is Qemu 2.7.0 on kernel 4.7.4
