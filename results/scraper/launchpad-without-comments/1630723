UART writes to netduino2/stm32f205-soc disappear

Writes to UART 2 and 3 disappear. As a sanity check I put printf statements in the function stm32f2xx_usart_write in qemu/hw/char/stm32f2xx_usart.c and recompiled qemu. The result confirmed text sent to UART1 and UART4 are sent to that function while text sent to UART 2 and 3 are not. I assume writes to all 4 need to make it to that function for emulations to operate correctly.

Example code that writes to all 4 UARTs/USARTs (does not contain the printf statements mention above):
