usb-host: ATI Technologies, Inc. TV Wonder acts as a different device if used

Title says it all. If you try to use the "ATI Technologies, Inc. TV Wonder" USB 1.1 TV Tuner for passthrough under any OS that has drivers for the device, the usb-host driver will confuse itself and give the device a new PID number for Linux.

Tested on ReactOS and Windows XP with stable QEMU package from pacman on Arch Linux.

Commands used: sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -hda ~/QEMU/hd/winxp.img -usb -device usb-host,hostbus=2,hostaddr=3 -vga vmware

Before starting qemu-kvm, lsusb reports:
[
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 0528:7561 ATI Technologies, Inc. TV Wonder
]

After starting qemu-kvm, usb-host and lsusb report:
[
libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] File doesn't exist, wait 10 ms and try again
libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] libusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/003: No such file or directory

The device in Bus 2, Device 3 is gone and it appears as this instead:
Bus 002 Device 005: ID 0573:0400 Zoran Co. Personal Media Division (Nogatech) D-Link V100
]

This weird effect only lasts until you unplug the TV Wonder.
