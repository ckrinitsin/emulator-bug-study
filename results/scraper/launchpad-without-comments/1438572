kvm does not support KVM_CAP_USER_MEMORY Please upgrade to at least kernel 2.6.29 or recent kvm-kmod (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/kvm)

We have a machine which is having QEMU+KVM on below configuration of linux
uname -a
Linux cairotrior 2.6.18-308.13.1.el5 #1 SMP Thu Jul 26 05:45:09 EDT 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
cat /etc/issue
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.8 (Tikanga)
Kernel \r on an \m


But in another setup, we are trying on a different machine having RHEL 5.9 having higher kernel version but it still gives below error
kvm does not support KVM_CAP_USER_MEMORY Please upgrade to at least kernel 2.6.29 or recent kvm-kmod (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/kvm).
failed to initialize KVM: Invalid argument No accelerator found!


I don’t know if the qemu version have compatibility issues with redhat 5.9 version –  need someone to check if the qemu can run on redhat 5.9 64 bit or not ?
