savevm with hax saves wrong register state

I use qemu-i386 with IntelHaxm on Windows 10 x64 host with Windows 7 x86 guest. I run the guest till OS loads and create a snapshot with savevm, then close qemu, run it again and try to load the snapshot with loadvm. The guest crashes or freezes. I dumped registers on snapshot creation and loading (in Haxm) and found that they are different.
When returning from Haxm in hax_vcpu_hax_exec, there is no regular register read. I found hax_arch_get_registers function which reads registers from Haxm and is called from a synchronization procedure. I placed a breakpoint on it, ran qemu and found that it is hit one time during guest OS boot. Exactly these registers where saved in the snapshot.
