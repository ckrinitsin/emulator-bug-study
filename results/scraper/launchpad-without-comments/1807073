qemu-guest-agent stop work when fsfreeze

Create a live snapshot, we should first to fsfreeze the file system. We do have only one disk mounted to /:
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev             48G     0   48G   0% /dev
tmpfs           9.5G  8.7M  9.5G   1% /run
/dev/vda1       485G  1.5G  484G   1% /
tmpfs            48G     0   48G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs            48G     0   48G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs           9.5G     0  9.5G   0% /run/user/0

snapshot action is OK, when we restore the snapshot, the file system became read-only, and syslog seems stop writing until we fsck /dev/vda1 and mount -o rw,remount /:
Dec  5 00:39:16 systemd[1]: Started Session 180 of user root.
Dec  5 00:45:05 qemu-ga: info: guest-fsfreeze called
Dec  5 07:00:45 kernel: [  114.623823] EXT4-fs (vda1): re-mounted. Opts: (null)

So after snapshoting, wo do fsthaw the file system,  maybe the qga dose not respond or stop work, this action dose not execute successfully and there is no log to show the status of qemu-guest-agent.
