[feature request] HP300 m68k system?

QEMU seems to support nothing (specific) that 4.4BSD was targeted to...would be useful to have a complete emulator for a full HP300 to run the binary dist from McKusick's CD set.

Devices that'd be needed: 
* 68020, 68030, or 68040 (How much of these are already present? Not sure if there was a non-standard MMU/FPU...but there was definitely a slightly-uncommon bus used for some peripherals)
* Networking was lance I am pretty sure...at least the onboard one.
* SCSI (Probably a standard chip as used EVERYWHERE ELSE..not sure off hand)
* Framebuffers optional, serial is sufficient for basic booting of 4.4.

Tape/disk can also be done via HP-IB...but SCSI would probably be easier unless extra peripherals were required (some serial stuff.)
