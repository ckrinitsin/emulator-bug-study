qemu cannot load multiple initramfs archives

According to Documentation/early-userspace/buffer-format.txt, an initramfs can be populated from multiple cpio archives, which seems like it could be a really useful feature when using QEMU to boot Linux kernels directly, without installing them on the disk image.

Unfortunately, QEMU does not support actually loading multiple files into the initrd space (which is also where initramfs archives go). It would be really nice if it did.
