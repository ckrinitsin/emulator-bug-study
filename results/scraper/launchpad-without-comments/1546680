Incorrect display colors when running big endian guest on POWER8 little endian host

When running a big endian CentOS guest on a little endian host system the display shows severe color issues, probably due to endianness not being properly detected / switched in the emulated display hardware.  Little endian guests show no display issues on the same host hardware and software.

See attachment for an example of the problem.
