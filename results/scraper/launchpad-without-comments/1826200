RFE: populate "OEM Strings" (type 11) SMBIOS table strings from regular files

The feature added in

  https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=2d6dcbf93fb01b4a7f45a93d276d4d74b16392dd

and exposed by libvirt as

  https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsSysinfo

allows the user to specify up to 255 strings in the unofmatted area of the Type 11 SMBIOS table, where each string may be of arbitrary length. This feature is useful for exposing arbitrary text to arbitrary guest components (in particular when strings are prefixed with "application identifiers").

Right now, strings can only be specified on the QEMU command line, which limits the amount of data that can be passed. Please enable users to pass data from regular files too.

For example:

  $QEMU -smbios type=11,value=Hello,txtfile=file1.txt,txtfile=file2.txt

where "file1.txt" and "file2.txt" could be text files containing ASCII application prefixes, followed by base64-encoded binary data.
