Bitmap Extra data is not supported

i am using dirty bitmaps and drive-backup. It works as aspected.

Lately, i encounter a disastrous error. There is not any information about that situation. I cannot reach/open/attach/info or anything with a qcow2 file.

virsh version
Compiled against library: libvirt 4.10.0
Using library: libvirt 4.10.0
Using API: QEMU 4.10.0
Running hypervisor: QEMU 2.12.0

"qemu-img: Could not open '/var/lib/libvirt/images/test.qcow2': Bitmap extra data is not supported"

what is that mean? what should i do?
i cannot remove bitmap. i cannot open image or query.
