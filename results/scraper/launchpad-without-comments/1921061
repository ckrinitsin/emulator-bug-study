Corsair iCUE Install Fails, qemu VM Reboots

Hi,

I had this working before, but in the latest version of QEMU (built from master), when I try to install Corsair iCUE, and it gets to the driver install point => my Windows 10 VM just reboots! I would be happy to capture logs, but ... what logs exist for an uncontrolled reboot? Thinking they are lost in the reboot :-(.

Thanks!
