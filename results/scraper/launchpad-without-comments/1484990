fsfreeze-hook script should also ignored dpkg generated files

Hello,

In the fsfreeze-hook script, the following code check if some of the files should be ignored:


# Check whether file $1 is a backup or rpm-generated file and should be ignored
is_ignored_file() {
    case "$1" in
        *~ | *.bak | *.orig | *.rpmnew | *.rpmorig | *.rpmsave | *.sample)
            return 0 ;;
    esac
    return 1
}

The functions should probably also skip dpkg generated files.

I've found a list of the different extensions in the systemd source tree: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/src/basic/util.c#L1871
