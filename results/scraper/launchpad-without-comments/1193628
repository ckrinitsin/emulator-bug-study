Undefined References

I've been able to make qemu on ubuntu 13.04 for all last releases: 1.4.0 -> 1.5.0

Unfortunately, when I launch one of them with a Cisco ASA, it crashes inside GNS3 (latest release) for Ubuntu.
The top GNS3 developer told me they experienced similar results and advised me to use qemu 1.1.0.

The problem is that I cannot link that version. I always have these errors:
 
"LINK  qemu-ga
qemu-timer.o: In function `dynticks_rearm_timer':
/home/actionmystique/Downloads/qemu-1.1.0/qemu-timer.c:538: undefined reference to `timer_gettime'

collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [qemu-ga] Error 1"

The man pages say we need to link with '-lrt' option, but I could not find it in the Makefile.
I do not know how to correct this issue.
