UI request: add a function key toolbar (f1-f12)

I run old DOS programs under FreeDOS using QEMU.

It's common when running/testing DOS applications to use the function keys. Some of these (such as F10) are intercepted by the window system. For example, some DOS program installers use F10 to install the software, but F10 is intecepted by the window system.

The standard solution is to jump to the QEMU console and use sendkey to send a specific function key to the QEMU guest (often needed for 'sendkey f10'). But this does not seem to be very user friendly for new users. Nor is it very fast if you need to this often.

I propose QEMU add a toolbar with the function keys.

I've attached a mockup of one possible design, with a simple toolbar for F1-F12. A possible modification would be to add "modifier" buttons for Ctrl and Shift and Alt to make it easier for users to enter combinations like Ctrl-F12 or Alt-F10 or Shift-F1.
