qemu-img: crash on check of an image with large value in the 'size' header field 

The qemu-img crashes on the next command:

qemu-img check test_image

'test_image' can be found in the attachment. It's a fuzzed test image with the qcow2 image header only. Suppositional cause of the failure is the value of 'size' header field set to maximum uint_64 value.
