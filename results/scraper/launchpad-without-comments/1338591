Cursor jumps on shape change with vmware vga

I launch QEMU with the following command line:

qemu-system-i386 /home/ruslan/iso/Windoze/qemuxp.img -m 512 -display sdl -vga vmware -enable-kvm

The guest OS is Windows XP. To reproduce the problem, do this:

0. Make sure guest is WinXP (don't know if it's really necessary), use vmware VGA
1. Set mouse cursor theme to default black&white theme, i.e. that without any translucency etc.
2. Open a text editor, e.g. built-in notepad
3. Move the cursor inside text entry widget
4. See the cursor jumping away. You basically can't enter the cursor there.

This also reproduces with MS Word 2003 even with oxy-white cursor theme (i.e. that with translucency) â€” seems Word uses its plain black&transparent cursor for I-beam cursor.

This doesn't happen with other VGAs, i.e. cirrus and std.

I used qemu git master to test this. qemu-system-i386 --version reports version 2.0.90, git describe says v2.1.0-rc0-1-g9d9de25. This also happened in earlier QEMU versions, like 1.5.x and older.
