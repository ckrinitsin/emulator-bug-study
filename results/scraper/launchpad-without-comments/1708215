Windows 10 clipboard bug

Hello,

I am using qemu on arch:
    pacman -Q libvirt qemu linux virt-manager
libvirt 3.5.0-1
qemu 2.9.0-2
linux 4.12.3-1
virt-manager 1.4.1-2

I have a windows 10 Guest, with all updates and the following packages installed in the guest:
- QEMU guest agent 7.3.2
- SPICE Guest Tools 0.132

When I start the VM, I can copy/paste from the host to the guest. However, after I use COPY inside the VM, copy/paste is not working any more from host to guest. However, I can still copy/paste from guest to host.

To summarize:
- copy/paste from guest to host works always
- copy/paste from host to guest works only if copy was not previously used in guest.

If this bug needs to be reported using another portal or if I can provide any further information, please contact me.

Best Regards,
gxgung
