VFIO device gets DMA failures when virtio-balloon leak from highmem to lowmem

Is there any known conflict between VFIO passthrough device and virtio-balloon?

The VM has:
1. 4GB system memory
2. one VFIO passthrough device which supports high address memory DMA and uses GFP_HIGHUSER pages.
3. Memory balloon device with 4GB target.

When setting the memory balloon target to 1GB and 4GB in loop during runtime (I used the command "virsh qemu-monitor-command debian --hmp --cmd balloon 1024"), the VFIO device DMA randomly gets failure.

More clues:
1. configure 2GB system memory (no highmem) VM, no issue with similar operations
2. setting the memory balloon to higher like 8GB, no issue with similar operations

I'm also trying to narrow down this issue. It's appreciated for that you guys may share some thoughts.
