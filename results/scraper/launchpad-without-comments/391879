migrate exec ignores exit status

Binary package hint: kvm

Using

  migrate "exec:cat > foo; false"

in the monitor results in the state of the VM being written to foo, as expected, and the VM then being stopped. This is surprising, as I think it stands to reason that in case of a failed migrate-exec process, which is what a non-zero exit status implies to me, the VM should continue.
