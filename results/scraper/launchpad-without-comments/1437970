qemu-system-x86_64 - two mouse pointers & fast scrolling problem

Hello,

System Specs

Host:
--------
Slackware 14.1 x86_64
Openbox 3.5.2
tint2 panel (svn version)
Nvidia GTX660M
nvidia-driver-346.35
Screen: 17" @1920x1080@60Hz

Slackware 14.1 x86_64
XFce 4.10
Screen 17" @1920x1080
xf86-video-vmware 13.0.1

QEMU 2.2.1

I start Slackware in QEMU using 'Zoom To Fit' when it first boots up and I log into X, at this point I notice the mouse shows with 2 pointers and when I move the mouse around, shows as trails, but it's actually a second pointer that appears under the first.

If I use 'Ctrl Alt F' and go into full screen mode the mouse gets corrected and only appears as one pointer and no pointer under the second one when moving around. So this mouse problem only appears the first time I log into X with 'Zoom To Fit'. 

Also if log in instead as 'Full Screen' I do not see the issue, as well as if I log in 'Full Screen' and change back to 'Zoom To Fit' it does not happen.

I also noticed that if I scroll with the mouse wheel very fast while, as an example, in any application and wanting to move quickly around, the mouse ends up moving me instead to another virtual desktop, XFce by default uses 4. If I just scroll slowly nothing happens, it's only when moving the mouse wheel quickly that the focus gets taken off the application for some reason and put on the desktop and moves you.

Command line options:
--------------------------------
qemu-system-x86_64 -rtc base=localtime Slackware\ 14.1\ x64.img -m 4096 --enable-kvm -smp 2 -vga vmware -usbdevice tablet

I wanted to use -usbdevice tablet to have seamless mouse movement back and forth from Host to Guest without having to Grab...

If I remove '-usbdevice tablet' and log into X the frst time as 'Zoom To Fit' I see two mouse pointers, but as soon as I click the desktop and the mouse is grabbed the second one goes away and when I move the mouse there is only one pointer.

Also without the optiion '-usbdevice tablet' and I move the scroll wheel quickly the mouse stays focused on the application and it doesn't move the desktop.

Please see the attached screen shots, qemu_1.jpg shows 2 mouse pointers when I first log into X and qemu_2.jpg shows when I'm staying in 'Zoom To Fit' mode and moving the mouse around, with a pointer under the pointer.
