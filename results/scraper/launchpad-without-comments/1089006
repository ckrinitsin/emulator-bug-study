Qemu scrambles order of eth devices in vm

HV = 12.04 LTS plus libvirt 1.0x
VM = 12.04 LTS

On the HV there are 12 eth interfaces which we make available to the VM. We have 4 10G virtual function interfaces, and 8 1G conventionally bridged interfaces. No matter what order we present the interfaces in the xml file, they come up in eth0-eth11 order on the VM as follows:   ( the interfcaes do work, once you figure out which is which)

eth0-eth7 not in order as compoared to the bridges on the HV (interfaces file) or compared to the xml file for the VM, or compared to the bus numbers. MAC addresses are random.
eth8-eth11 show up in the VM  in order of PCU bus numbers just as you'd expect, always after the bridged interfaces.

Consulting the libvirt mailing list, the developer says they present the list in bus order to qemu, but qemu scrambles that order. That appears to me too, to be the case.
