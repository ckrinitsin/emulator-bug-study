qemu --static user build fails with fedora rawhide glibc-2.30.9000

Building qemu latest git 654efcb511d on fedora rawhide fails with this configure line:

./configure \
	--static \
	--disable-system \
	--enable-linux-user \
	--disable-werror \
	--disable-tools \
	--disable-capstone

make fails with:

/usr/bin/ld: linux-user/syscall.o: in function `do_syscall1':
/root/qemu.git/linux-user/syscall.c:7769: undefined reference to `stime'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Seems related to this glibc change: https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=12cbde1dae6fa4a9a792b64564c7e0debf7544cc

...

+* The obsolete function stime is no longer available to newly linked
+  binaries and it has been removed from <time.h> header.  This function
+  has been deprecated in favor of clock_settime.

FWIW there's some other messages but I don't think they are fatal:

/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/9/../../../../lib64/libglib-2.0.a(gutils.c.o): in function `g_get_user_database_entry':

Also, --disable-capstone is required to avoid this error, but it is pre-existing, not sure if it's a bug, if so I can file a separate one:

  LINK    aarch64-linux-user/qemu-aarch64
