Swapping caps lock and control causes qemu confusion

Running Fedora14 [host], I have caps-lock and control swapped over in my keyboard preferences.

Qemu doesn't cope very well with this; running an OS inside Qemu (again fedora, suspect that it doesn't matter):

The physical caps-lock key [which the host uses as control] toggles caps-lock on both press and release.

The physical control key [which the host uses as caps-lock], acts as both a caps-lock and control key.

Qemu should either respect my keyboard layout or else ignore it completely.
