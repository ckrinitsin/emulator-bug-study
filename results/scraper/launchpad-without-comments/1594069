SIMD instructions translated to scalar host instructions

SIMD instructions inside the guest (NEON, MMX, SSE, SSE2, AVX) are translated to scalar instructions on the host instead of SIMD instructions.  It appears that there have been a few efforts to rectify this [1], and even a submitted patch series, but all discussion has effectively died out [2].

I would like to see better SIMD performance on qemu, especially as non-x86 architectures are becoming widely used (e.g. ARM).
