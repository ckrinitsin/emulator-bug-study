RDP traffic freeze on quiet network

Hi,

I recently started using KVM over VirtualBox for my Office needs. I setup a Windows 7 VM on KVM and started using it through remote desktop. 

What happens is that, after some hours of usage, the remote desktop connection freezes. I thought it was a remmina bug, as the it was enough to kill and restart it to successfully connect again to the VM.

However, today I've switched to a different RDP client (2X Client chromium app) and the freeze just happened again!

Some information:
- the host and the VM are completely idle when the freeze occurs
- I've tried sniffing the network packets toward the RDP port during the freeze and found that the client is sending packets but no packet is sent back


Could this be a KVM issue? How can I further debug this one (I expect the freeze to happen again...)?
