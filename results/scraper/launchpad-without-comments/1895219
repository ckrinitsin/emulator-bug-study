qemu git -vnc fails due to missing en-us keymap

If trying to run qemu with -vnc :0, it will fail with:
./qemu-system-x86_64 -vnc :2
qemu-system-x86_64: -vnc :2: could not read keymap file: 'en-us'

share/keymaps is missing en-us keymap and only has sl and sv, confirmed previous stable versions had en-us. 

Tried with multiple targets, on arm64 and amd64
