Storage | Two decimal digits precision

Tested on: Fedora 34; Component: qemu-img-5.2.0-5.fc34.1.x86_64

Hello. A two decimal digits precision is most appropriated on systems whose storage capacities have to be saved. That is one of the reason why such precision is supported in the context of creation of virtual machines in several Unix/Linux virtualization platforms; virt-manager is one of them. That last exhibits virtual disks size values with such precision – 128.00 GiB – nevertheless it lacks yet a mention illustrating physical disks size values. 

Storage values exhibited in qemu-img and virt-manager are already according to a clear format; thus, values are not attached to their measure units (#value# #units#).

$ qemu-img info ~/.local/share/libvirt/images/fedora_default.img | sed -n '2,4p'
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 128 GiB (137438953472 bytes)
disk size: 147 MiB
