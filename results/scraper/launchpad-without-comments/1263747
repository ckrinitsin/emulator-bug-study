Arm64 fails to run a binary which runs OK on real hardware

This binary:

http://oirase.annexia.org/tmp/test.gz

runs OK on real aarch64 hardware.  It is a statically linked Linux binary which (if successful) will print "hello, world" and exit cleanly.

On qemu-arm64 userspace emulator it doesn't print anything and loops forever using 100% CPU.

----
The following section is only if you wish to compile this binary from source, otherwise you can ignore it.

First compile OCaml from:

https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml

(note you have to compile it on aarch64 or in qemu, it's not possible to cross-compile).  You will have to apply the one-line patch from:

https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-12/msg00179.html

    ./configure
    make -j1 world.opt

Then do:

    echo 'print_endline "hello, world"' > test.ml
    ./boot/ocamlrun ./ocamlopt -I stdlib stdlib.cmxa test.ml -o test
    ./test
