qemu-system-alpha console unresponsive

I have created a virtual machine using the QEMU Alpha emulator (very basic, 1 scsi disc, 1 scsi CDROM, 1gb memory). The machine starts, but entering any system commands at the prompt just echs back the command typed. For example 

>>> show device
got: show device
>>> 

Obviously booting any OS from this is not possible.
