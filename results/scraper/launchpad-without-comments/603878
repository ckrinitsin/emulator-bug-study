[Feature request] qemu-img option about recompressing

Suppose I have a fresh compressed qcow2 image. After some time the data were recorded without compression. I decide to make "QEMU-IMG convert" for that image to reduce its size.

I want a new option, which selects between the two algorithms overdriven images:
1. extract all / compress again when converting images (in the current implementation)
2. compress only uncompressed blocks and just copy the compressed blocks without re-compression.

This option is only needed when converting compressed image to compressed and the compression algorithm is the same.
