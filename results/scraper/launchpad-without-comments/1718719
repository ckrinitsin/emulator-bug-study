qemu can't capture keys properly under wayland

This appears to be different than the previous similar bugs; patches do look to be applied to use libinput in the wayland case. Still:

unknown keycodes `(unnamed)', please report to <email address hidden>

I am using qemu-system-x86                       1:2.10+dfsg-0ubuntu1

Many key inputs work correctly, but at boot the system will not properly catch the arrow keys, the above error shows up immediately after hitting Esc (for instance) to get to the boot menu. Booting from CD onto a daily Ubuntu desktop image, I can't navigate the splash menu.

The same works correctly through virt-manager (which uses spice AFAICT, but wayland tends to crash when running virt-manager), and things work if I switch my session to Xorg rather than wayland.
