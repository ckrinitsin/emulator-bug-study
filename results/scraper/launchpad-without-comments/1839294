Latest Installer (qemu-w64-setup-20190807.exe) for windows immediately deletes installed files at the very end of the installation

This happens on Windows 10 with the latest installer for 64 bit Windows: qemu-w64-setup-20190807.exe

On install it will create the files and go through all the typical functions of installing the software, at the very end step it will then delete all files the installer created.

I looked for logs to see when was going on so I ran the installation in Sandboxie and was able to retain all the installed files but I couldn't find a log for the installer.

Here is a screenshot of it deleting all the files at the end of the process.

If goes too fast for me to see what is written in the text console otherwise I would post more information but this is all I have. It does not give any error or any other information at completion.

This error does not occur in the earlier release: qemu-w64-setup-20190731.exe
