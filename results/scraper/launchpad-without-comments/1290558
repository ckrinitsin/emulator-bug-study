color issue (ppc as guest)

Hi, 

on my qemu 1.6.1 -- installed via fink on host Mac OS X 10.8 -- guest PowerPc with Mac OS X 10.4 from original install disk, boots fine but I observe a color issue exactly as described here:

Has the problem been reported and/or fixed already? Is any workaround known or has one been suggested? 
I apologize for a "fuzzy" problem description, but I am not an expert user. You may get in touch with me directly at <email address hidden>

Thanks,
Joe.
