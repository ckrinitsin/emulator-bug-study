qemu: uncaught target signal 5 (Trace/breakpoint trap)

I'm getting core dumped when running the attached a.out_err binary in qemu, but when using Gdb to remote-debug the program, it exited normally. will appreciate if you can help look into this qemu issue.

And I found that QEMU's 32-bit arm linux-user mode doesn't correctly turn guest BKPT insns into SIGTRAP signal.
