bundle QEMU installer with HAXM accelerator for Windows

As you probably know HAXM is an accelerator for Windows.

Currently it is required to first install QEMU and then install HAXM.

For a better out of the box user experience on the Windows platform it would be nice if QEMU and HAXM would be installed by the same installer.
