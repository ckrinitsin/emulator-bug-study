nl-be keymap is wrong

As mentioned on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kvm/+bug/429965 as well as the kvm mailinglist (http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/14413), the nl-be keymap does not work. The number keys above the regular keys (non-numeric keypad numbers) as well as vital keys such as slash, backslash, dash, ... are not working.

The nl-be keymap that is presented in the above URLs (and also attached to this bug) does work properly.

Would it be possible to include this keymap rather than the current one?
