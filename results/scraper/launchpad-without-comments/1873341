Qemu Win98 VM with KVM videocard passthrough DOS mode video is not working for most of games..

Hello,
im using Win98 machine with KVM videocards passthrough which is working fine, but when i try Windows 98 - Dosbox mode, there is something work with all videocards which i tried PCI-E/PCI - Nvidia, 3Dfx, Matrox.

 Often is framerate is very slow, as slideshow:
Doom 2, Blood, even for Fdisk start - i can see how its slowly rendering individual lines, or its not working at all - freeze / black screen only - Warcraft 2 demo (vesa 640x480). 

 There is something wrong with it.

 Qemu 2.11 + 4.2, Linux Mint 19.3. Gigabyte Z170 MB.
