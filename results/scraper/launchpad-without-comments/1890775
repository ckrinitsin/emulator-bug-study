Aten USB to Serial bridge does not work with qemu under Windows 10

I would like to use MSDOS 6.22 with qemu (unfortunatelly lot of our test programs has been written in dos).
I tried to connect two laptop by RS232 port, one of the machine have a built-in serial port and run with native MSDOS 6.22 with 4.0 norton commander. Another machine have only USB ports and i try to use a new Aten USB to Serial device. Ok. Has been started qemu with -serial and -chardev parameters, at startup appear a window with serial port setting such as baud rate, start bit, etc...

Quemu has been satrted succeeded but serial port cannot be used becouse was nothing activited on usb serial adapter :(

I tried same configuration with VirtualBox and everything was worked fine (serial connection was estabiled and copied several files from one machine into another machine), seems to be the emulated serial port has been worked fine.

I would like to use qemu, i just thougt qemu is better, simple and faster...

Exists solution or is this a qemu bug?

Thank you!
