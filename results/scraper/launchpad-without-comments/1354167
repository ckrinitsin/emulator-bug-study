On VM restart: Could not open 'poppy.qcow2': Could not read snapshots: File too large

I'm unable to restart a VM.   virt-manager is giving me:

Error starting domain: internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: qemu-system-x86_64: -drive file=/var/lib/libvirt/images/poppy.qcow2,if=none,id=drive-virtio-disk0,format=qcow2: could not open disk image /var/lib/libvirt/images/poppy.qcow2: Could not read snapshots: File too large


From the command line trying to check the image also gives me:
qemu-img check poppy.qcow2
qemu-img: Could not open 'poppy.qcow2': Could not read snapshots: File too large


This bug appears with both the default install of qemu for ubuntu 14.04:
qemu-img version 2.0.0, Copyright (c) 2004-2008 Fabrice Bellard

And the latest version.
qemu-img version 2.1.50, Copyright (c) 2004-2008 Fabrice Bellard
