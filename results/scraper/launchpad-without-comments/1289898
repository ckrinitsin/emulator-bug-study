qemu-system-ppc64 easily cause file corruption

the qemu-system-ppc64 is used to run Fedora-19 on RHEL 5.3.
Previously I was using QEMU 1.5.x for several months with no problem. But after the RHEL 5.3 host damaged, and rebuilt, now I tried both QEMU 1.6.2 and QEMU 1.7.0, found both can easily cause file corruptions. Symptoms:

* using scp to transfer a tar.bz file from the RHEL 5.3 host to the Fedora-19 PPC VM, found the size is correct, but the content is corrupted from the middle of the 80+ MB file.  re-transfer again, got a correct file. But after untar, found some extracted files corrupted.
The extracted file corruption happened several times, and also the filesystem in the VM had corrupted several times, had to restore the boot image to recover.
