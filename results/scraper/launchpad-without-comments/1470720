high IRQ-TLB generates network interruptions

 we are having a problem in our hosts, all the vm running on them suddenly, and for some seconds, lost network connectivity.

the root cause appears to be the increase of irb-tlb from low values (less than 20) to more than >100k, that spike only last for some seconds then everything goes back to normal

i've upload an screenshot of collectd for one hypervisor here

we have hosts running precise (qemu 1.5, ovs 2.0.2, libvirt 1.2.2 and kernel 3.13) where the issue is frequent. also we have an small % of our fleet running trusty (qemu 2.0.0 ovs 2.0.2 libvirt 1.2.2 and kernel 3.16) where the problem seemed to be nonexistent until today

issue seems to be isolated to < 10% of our hypervisors, some hypervisors had this problem every few days, others only once or twice. our vm are a black box to us we don't know what users run on them, but mostly cpu and network bound workload.
most of our guests run centos 6.5 (kernel 2.6.32)

vm are bridged to a linuxbridge then veth wired to an ovs switch (neutron openvswitch agent setup)
