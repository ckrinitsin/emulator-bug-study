Provide target specific qemu man pages

Right now, all qemu target binaries (qemu-system-...) share the same man page.

The current man page is primarily focused on x86, and therefore the information given is entirely wrong for e.g. arm, powerpc or s390x.

NAME
       qemu-doc - QEMU Emulator User Documentation

SYNOPSIS
       qemu-system-i386 [options] [disk_image]

DESCRIPTION
       The QEMU PC System emulator simulates the following peripherals:

       -   i440FX host PCI bridge and PIIX3 PCI to ISA bridge

       -   Cirrus CLGD 5446 PCI VGA card or dummy VGA card with Bochs VESA extensions (hardware level, including all non
           standard modes).

       -   PS/2 mouse and keyboard

       -   2 PCI IDE interfaces with hard disk and CD-ROM support

       -   Floppy disk

...

We should have target specific man pages, with the common options/settings factored out, so they are included in all target specific man pages.

"man qemu-system-s390x" should give s390x specific (+common) information and "man qemu-system-x86_64" should contain x86 specific (+common) information.
