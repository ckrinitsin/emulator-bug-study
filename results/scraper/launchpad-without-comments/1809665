Xbox One controller USB passthrough disconnections and stops

I can't properly passthrough my Xbox One controller to a virtual machine; it causes USB disconnections on the host, ultimately preventing it to work (at all) on the guest

I've seen a few other cases reported in other websites, which show the same symptoms:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/97dhbw/qemu_w10_xbox_one_controller
- https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/452751/how-can-i-pass-through-an-xbox-one-controller-to-a-windows-vm-on-ubuntu

This is sample:

    libusb: error [udev_hotplug_event] ignoring udev action bind
    qemu-system-x86_64: libusb_release_interface: -4 [NO_DEVICE]
    qemu-system-x86_64: libusb_release_interface: -4 [NO_DEVICE]
    qemu-system-x86_64: libusb_release_interface: -4 [NO_DEVICE]
    libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] File doesn't exist, wait 10 ms and try again
    libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] libusb couldn't open USB device
        /dev/bus/usb/003/016: No such file or directory

I think this is a quite long-standing issue, as I've been experiencing through several versions, including the current one (3.1).

I can reproduce this 100% of the times, on multiple host O/S distributions (the current one being based on Ubuntu 18.04 x86-64).

I compile QEMU directly from source, and execute it via commandline; the command is very long, however, the relevant part is standard (I think):

    -usb \
    -device usb-tablet \
    -device usb-host,vendorid=0x$VGAPT_XBOX_PAD_VEND_ID,productid=0x$VGAPT_XBOX_PAD_PROD_ID \

The guest is Windows 10 64bit.
