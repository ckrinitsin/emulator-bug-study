xv6 Bootloop

Qemu Version: 4.2.0

Launch command: 
qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -drive file=fs.img,index=1,media=disk,format=raw -drive file=xv6.img,index=0,media=disk,format=raw -smp 2 -m 512

How to reproduce? 
1.)  Use/install latest release of qemu (4.2.0 at time of writing)

2.)  Download, build, and run xv6 (a simple os designed for learning operating systems fundamentals)

cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git
cd xv6-public
make qemu-nox

3.)  Qemu should now bootloop (seem to try to boot but then just repeat). This is what it looks like below before it repeats:

SeaBIOS (version ?-20191223_100556-anatol)

iPXE (http://ipxe.org) 00:03.0 CA00 PCI2.10 PnP PMM+1FF92A50+1FEF2A50 CA00
                                                                               
Booting from Hard Disk..



Host: Arch Linux - Kernel version: 5.4.13
Guest: xv6 (https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public)

Suspicion:

When I was using qemu 2.11.1 inside docker, the xv6 os booted with no problem. I am thinking that something changed between Qemu 2.11.1 and Qemu 4.2.0 which is now causing boot problems.
