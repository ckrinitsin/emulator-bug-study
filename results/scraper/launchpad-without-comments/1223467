Unable to use USB as hda in Windows

I built qemu 1.6.0 from source in MinGW (and all dependents not available with mingw-get) 
The command line:
qemu-system-i386.exe -m 1024 -hda \\.\PhysicalDrive1 -L pc-bios
or
qemu-system-x86_64.exe -m 1024 -hda \\.\PhysicalDrive1 -L pc-bios
(or the *w.exe equivalents)
reports in stderr.txt:
qemu-system-i386.exe: -hda \\.\PhysicalDrive1: Block protocol 'host_device' doesn't support the option 'filename'
qemu-system-i386.exe: -hda \\.\PhysicalDrive1: could not open disk image \\.\PhysicalDrive1: Invalid argument

I have also found this bug in 1.5 but not in 1.4

Some Help:
The code in Qemu is a bit beyond me at 1am, but I was able to determine the root cause seems to be that block.c is becoming confused about referring to a file but not having a file name. I have been able to work around this by changing line 860 of block.c from:  "if (qdict_size(options) != 0) {" to "if (qdict_size(options) != 0 && !is_windows_drive(filename)) {"

But I don't think this is a good solution (it is assuming that nothing else could be wrong), and I can't be sure that I'm not masking some real issue.

FWIW; Build is on XP, but execution is on Win7.

Thanks.
