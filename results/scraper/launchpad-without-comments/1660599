v2.8.0 won't compile if g++ compiler doesn't understand "-fstack-protector-strong"

For example, Ubuntu Trusty (LTS 14.04) uses g++ v4.8.5.
Compilation fails with a syntax error saying that the ""-fstack-protector-strong" option in g++ is unrecognized.
Instead, under Ubuntu Xenial (LTS 16.04), the g++ compiler is v5.4.0 and the compilation goes on smoothly.
