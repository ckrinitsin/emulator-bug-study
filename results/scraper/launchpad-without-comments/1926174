Laggy and/or displaced mouse input on CloudReady (Chrome OS) VM

This weekend I tried to get a CloudReady (Chrome OS) VM running on qemu 5.2. This seems to wok quite well, performance seems to be great in fact. Only problem is mouse input.

Using SDL display, there is no visible mouse unless I set "show-cursor=on". After that the mouse pointer flickers a bit and most of the time is displaced so I need to press below a button in order to hit it. After switching to fullscreen and back using ctrl-alt-f this effect seems to be fixed for a while but the mouse pointer does not reach all parts of the emulated screen anymore.

Using SPICE instead the mouse pointer is drawn, but it is *very* laggy. In fact it is only drawn every few seconds so it is unusable but placement seems to be correct. Text input is instant, so general emulation speed is not an issue here.

To reproduce, download the free image from https://www.neverware.com/freedownload#home-edition-install

Then run one of the following commands:

qemu-system-x86_64 -drive driver=raw,file=cloudready-free-89.3.3-64bit.bin -machine pc,accel=kvm -m 2048 -device virtio-vga,virgl=on -display sdl,gl=on,show-cursor=on -usb -device usb-mouse -device intel-hda -device hda-duplex

qemu-system-x86_64 -drive driver=raw,file=cloudready-free-89.3.3-64bit.bin -machine pc,accel=kvm -m 2048 -device virtio-vga,virgl=on -display spice-app,gl=on -usb -device usb-mouse -device intel-hda -device hda-duplex
