mips_cpu_handle_mmu_fault renders all accessed pages executable

On MIPS, data accesses to pages mapped in the TLB result in mips_cpu_handle_mmu_fault() marking the page unconditionally executable, even if the TLB entry has the XI bit set. Later on, when there is an attempt to execute this page, no exception is generated, even though TLBXI is expected.
