cpu-exec.c:648: cpu_loop_exec_tb: Assertion `use_icount' failed.

OpenJDK no longer works on qemu-sh4, it previously did after #1735384 was fixed.

Crash indicates an assertion failure:

(sid-sh4-sbuild)root@nofan:/# java --version
qemu-sh4-static: /root/qemu/accel/tcg/cpu-exec.c:648: cpu_loop_exec_tb: Assertion `use_icount' failed.
qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped
Aborted

Haven't bi-sected the issue yet, but will do so later.
