RFE: Support spice via unix domain socket

According to the man page, spice can be only used via TCP/IP in opposite to VNC, which can also be configured to listen on a unix domain socket. To make it easy to use spice without exposing the interface, please support unix domain sockets as well. I can try  to provide a patch, if you can point me to the source code where TCP/IP socket is opened.
