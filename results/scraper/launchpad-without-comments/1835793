Running an edk2 based bios

This is not necessarily a bug, however I wasn't sure were to get help.

I am currently working on using QEMU  to run a BIOS my company has developed. In order to see if the software was working correctly, I was able to successfully run the edk2 bios using the following command:

qemu-system-x86_64.exe -bios "C:\Users\matthew.intriago\Desktop\ovmf.fd" -net none

However, when running the same command using  our personalized bios, QEMU launches stating that “guest has not initialized display”. Theoretically, QEMU should be able to run the bios since it is edk2 based, the only difference between the two is that our bios has more features. 

If anyone has any insight on what the issue might be I would greatly appreciate any help.
