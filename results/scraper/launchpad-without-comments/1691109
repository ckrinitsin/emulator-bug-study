qemu-kvm not working as nested inside ESX 6.0

ESX 6.0 (virt bits exposed) - Ubuntu 16.04 + qemu-kvm 1:2.8+dfsg-3ubuntu2~cloud0 - CirrOS launched by OpenStack (devstack master)


VM will start with -machine = 'pc-i440fx-zesty' and will stuck in "booting from hard disk"

to fix it you can manually change -machine to 'pc-i440fx-2.3'

also, ISOs boots well, so I think it`s something about block devices configuration introduced in new machine type.

p.s.
also confirmed with RHEL instead of Ubuntu as KVM host - new machine type don`t work
