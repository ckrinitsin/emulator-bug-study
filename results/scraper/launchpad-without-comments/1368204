WinME isn't able to detect QEMU's cdrom drive and other hard drives automatically

On a fresh installation of Windows Millennium (WinME) in qemu, Windows Me isn't able to find the CD-ROM drive or additional hard drives other than -hda at first place.

Only if i add manually an IDE controller driver in Windows ME's device manager, the CD-ROM inserted in QEMU is found.
Thus an IDE controller isn't found automatically either.

This shouldn't be the case. On normal real hardware, Windows ME would find at least one IDE or SCSI controller.

The command line that was used is the following:
sudo /usr/bin/qemu-system-i386 -hda WinME_QEMU.img -cdrom drivers.iso -boot c -no-acpi -no-hpet -soundhw sb16 -net nic -cpu pentium3 -m 256 -vga cirrus   

qemu's version is:
qemu-system-i386 --version
