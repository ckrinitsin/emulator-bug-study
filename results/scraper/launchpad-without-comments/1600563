min_io_size is currently limited to size uint16_t

I am using LVM VGs on MD-raid1 for hosting my KVM volumes. On the host, a VG looks like this:

Disk /dev/vm/vol202a: 60 GiB, 64424509440 bytes, 125829120 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 131072 bytes / 131072 bytes

In order to replicate the block device characteristics in the guest, I am using the following extra parameters:

-set device.scsi0-0-0-0.logical_block_size=512
-set device.scsi0-0-0-0.physical_block_size=4096
-set device.scsi0-0-0-0.min_io_size=131072

This doesn't work as qemu complains that min_io_size needs to be of type uint16_t.
