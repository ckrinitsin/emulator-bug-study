USB Passthrough Fails on Start, Needs domain Reset

Hi,

I am seeing (consistently = always), USB Passthrough for my Logitech Keyboard and Mouse ... they don't work / no response on domain (VM) startup. After a reset of the VM they then work - but why are they "dead" on initial startup of the VM? Is this a known issue?

Running,
QEMU emulator version 5.0.0 (Debian 1:5.0-5ubuntu9.1)

And if it makes a difference, this is a macOS guest (on a Linux host).

Thanks!
