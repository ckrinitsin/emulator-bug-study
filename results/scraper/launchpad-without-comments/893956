qemu-img bug with dynamic vhd

Hye, i found a problem with qemu-img when trying to get info of a dynamic vhd. I made imgae of my 60GB computer hard drive with disk2vhd. The dynamic vhd is 21gb size.

With 1.0-rc3 version :
running command: qemu-img info 60_GB.VHD
qemu-img:  Could not open '60_GB.VHD' : File too large

0.14.1 version give me wrong information :
image: 60_GB.VHD
file format: vpc
virtual size: 127G (136899993600 bytes)
disk size: 21G

Thanks for reply.
