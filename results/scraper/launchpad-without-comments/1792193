AMD Athlon(tm) X2 Dual-Core QL-64 bug

I upgrade my qemu 2.12.0-2 => 3.0.0-1. After that I can't load virtual machine with "-cpu host" option. Full command line is
qemu-system-x86_64 \
	-monitor stdio \
	-enable-kvm \
	-cpu host \
	-smp cpus=2 \
	-m 1G \
	-vga virtio \
	-display gtk,gl=on \
	-soundhw ac97 \
	-drive file=/ehdd/qemu/arch_hw_12_08_2018/arch_shrinked.raw,format=raw,if=virtio
I have Arch Linux on virtual machine. When I start QEMU, GRUB tries to load initial ramdisk and stops. System doesn't load. If I try to start virtual machine with "-cpu athlon" option then get the same bug.
I downgrade back to qemu 2.12.0-2 and virtual machine works fine, system loads.
My processor is AMD Athlon(tm) X2 Dual-Core QL-64.
