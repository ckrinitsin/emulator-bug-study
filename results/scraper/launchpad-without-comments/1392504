libvirt not relabeling devices on USB Passthrough

After upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 to Ubuntu 14.10 USB passthrough in QEMU (version is now 2.1.0 - Debian2.1+dfsg-4ubuntu6.1) is not working any more. Already tried to remove and attach the USB devices. I use 1 USB2 HDD  +  1 USB3 HDD to a virtual linux machine; 1 USB2 HDD to a virual FNAS machine and a USB 2camera to virtual Win7 machine. All these devices are not working any more.
