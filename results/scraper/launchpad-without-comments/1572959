bcm2835_property: inconsistent values when both setting and querying the framebuffer 

As the framebuffer settings are copied into the result message before it is reconfigured, inconsistent behavior can happen when, for instance, you set with a single message the width, height, and depth, and ask at the same time to allocate the buffer and get the pitch and the size.

In this case, the reported pitch and size would be incorrect as they were computed with the initial values of width, height and depth, not the ones the client requested.

Attached is a patch also sent to the qemu-devel mailing list.
