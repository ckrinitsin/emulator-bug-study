suspend/resume is not supported for vm with tpm device

I have used libvirt with qemu to create a vm with tpm device, when I suspend the vm and resume it, libvirt will
raise error:
libvirtError: internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: Enter char_pty_open
I find some materials:
https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/TPM
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2015-05/msg05355.html
They present qemu haven't supported tpm suspend/resume, Does someone have any advice on how to resolve the problem?

qemu version: 2.10.2
vm image version: centos 7.2

Thanks
