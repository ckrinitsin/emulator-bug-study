Solaris host: no network connection, mouse pointer mismatch

This is probably a bit far afield but on a Solaris 10 SPARC host (Sun M3000) running a Windows XP guest like this:

./qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 -boot d  -smp 3 -net nic -net user -hda  /bkpool/qemuimages/XP.img -cdrom /bkpool/qemuimages/xp.iso &

the vnc server starts up and Windows boots normally.  However, there is no network connectivity.  There are no network devices visible in XP's Networking tab of Control Panel and a ping of the local router reports "unreachable".

Also, the keyboard works fine but the guest mouse pointer is offset from the host mouse position by an amount that varies by screen position.  This makes it impossible to point to locations near the edge of the qemu window.  This seems to be a previously reported problem, but the suggested fix, " -device usb-tablet", prevents qemu from even starting:

qemu-system-x86_64: -device usb-tablet: No 'usb-bus' bus found for device 'usb-tablet'

The physical mouse is connected to the USB port of a Sun Ray 2fs controlling the M3000 via Sun Ray server.  I apologize if this is a configuration issue and not a bug but I don't know where else to report it and have been unable to find a solution in the documentation.
