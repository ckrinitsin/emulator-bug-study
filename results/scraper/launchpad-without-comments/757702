ARM: singlestepping insn which UNDEFs should stop at UNDEF vector insn, not after it

ARMv7a has lot of undefined instruction from its instruction opcode space. This undefined instructions are very useful for replacing sensitive non-priviledged instructions of guest operating systems (virtualization). The undefined instruction exception executes at <exception_base> + 0x4, where <exception_base> can be 0x0 or 0xfff00000. Currently, in qemu 0.14.0 undefined instruction fault at 0x8 offset instead of 0x4. This was not a problem with qemu 0.13.0, seems like this is a new bug. As as example, if we try to execute value "0xec019800" in qemu 0.14.0 then it should cause undefined exception at <exception_base>+0x4 since "0xec019800" is an undefined instruction.
