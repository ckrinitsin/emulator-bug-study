keyboard errors in DOS, found links to similar errors for reference

OS: slackware 14.2, updated. qemu version: 4.1.0 (from slackbuild script)

command line: qemu-system-i386 -hda msdos.vhd

Description of problem: MSDOS 6.22 disk image running gwbasic 3.23. Cursor keys and sometimes letter keys are repeated. Cursor keys seemingly always, letter keys seem to happen when typing too fast.  Numpad arrows are not affected.  Also insert key doesnt seem to work at all.

Have found one similar current bug, Bug #1574246 Drunken keyboard in go32v2 programs https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1574246?comments=all and a much older vbox bug report that seems very similar, https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/58 , and for some reason mentions a qemu patch.
