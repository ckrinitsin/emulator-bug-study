CTRL+ALT is ignored on gtk window (configured with gtk and sdl)

I am building and using qemu on Windows 10 via git.
Building for targeting windows, on debian.

Since meson is introduced, my executable, qemu-system-x86_64.exe, tends to ignore hotkeys
(like CTRL+ATL+G, CTRL+ALT+2)

As far as I have been investigating the issue, I am suspicious that gtk and sdl might be incompatible.
With configure --disable-sdl, my executable works fine.
My application doesn't require sdl.

Possibly due to link order, especially SDLmain, I guess.

I suggest;
- Clarify that gtk and sdl are incompatible.
- Tweak built script or startup not to prevent gtk and sdl each other.

Excuse me, the issue has not been reproduced at home yet. I met it at work.
(My manager said it's fine to report issues by me at home)
I will construct reproducible environment at home, if my further investigation would be required.

Thanks.
