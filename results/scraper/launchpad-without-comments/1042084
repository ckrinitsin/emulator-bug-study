Windows 7 guest cannot boot after seabios updated

Hi,

I can no longer boot my Windows 7 guest after this commit (update seabios to latest master)

http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=01afdadc92e71e29700e64f3a5f42c1c543e3cf9

When I tried to boot Windows, it BSOD and said "The BIOS in this system is not fully ACPI compliant. Please contact your system vendor for an updated  BIOS". Reverting this commit will fix the issue.
