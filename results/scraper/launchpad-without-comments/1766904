Creating high hdd load (with constant fsyncs) on a SATA disk leads to freezes and errors in guest dmesg

After upgrading from qemu 2.10.0+dfsg-2 to 2.12~rc3+dfsg-2 (on debian sid host), centos 7 guest started to show freezes and ata errors in dmesg during hdd workloads with writing many small files and repeated fsyncs.

Host kernel 4.15.0-3-amd64.
Guest kernel 3.10.0-693.21.1.el7.x86_64 (slightly older guest kernel was tested too with same result).

Script that reproduces the bug (first run usualy goes smooth, second and later runs result in dmesg errors and freezes):

Sample of error messages in guest dmesg:

A workaround that I am using right now: I have detached this SATA storage and reattached the same .qcow2 file as SCSI - this has fixed the issue for me.
