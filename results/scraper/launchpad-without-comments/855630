Cant Run Wine (posix not nptl) past 0.14.1

when trying to build qemu I can build with ./configure --static --enable-sdl --target-list=i386-linux-user just fine with 0.12.5

But when I try to go on 0.13.0 or higher (tested on 0.15.0) it will say it cant find libSDL.

Tried with arm and x86 versions of Ubuntu 9.10 and 11.04. Same on all 4 tests.

I found I could run posix wine on 12.5 but I cant go higher for posix wine because of that libSDL.
