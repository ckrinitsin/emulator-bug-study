colo: pvm flush failed after svm killed

Hi,
   Primary vm flush failed after killing svm, which leads primary vm guest filesystem unavailable.

qemu versoin: 5.2.0
host/guest os: CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)

Reproduce steps:
1. create colo vm following https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/docs/COLO-FT.txt
2. kill secondary vm (don't remove nbd child from quorum on primary vm)and wait for a minute. the interval depends on guest os.
result: primary vm file system shutdown because of flush cache error.

After serveral tests, I found that qemu-5.0.0 worked well, and it's the commit https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=883833e29cb800b4d92b5d4736252f4004885191(block: Flush all children in generic code) leads this change, and both virtio-blk and ide turned out to be bad.

I think it's nbd(replication) flush failed leads bdrv_co_flush(quorum_bs) failed, here is the call stack.
#0  bdrv_co_flush (bs=0x56242b3cc0b0=nbd_bs) at ../block/io.c:2856

While i am not sure whether i use colo inproperly? Can we assume that nbd child of quorum immediately removed right after svm crashed? Or it's really a bug? Does the following patch fix? Help is needed! Thanks a lotÔºÅ
