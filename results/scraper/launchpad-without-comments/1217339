SIGQUIT to send ACPI-shutdown to Guest

When qemu receives SIGQUIT, it should first try to run system_powerdown (giving the guest an ACPI signal to begin the shutdown process), before ending the whole qemu process.

At this point there is no way to do a graceful shutdown if you do not have access to the monitor and you do not use any wrapper like libvirt.

If, for some reason SIGQUIT would not be accepted as the signal, take any free to use signal, like SIGUSR1. There should be a way to get ACPI shutdown sent to the guest.
