Qemu ARMv7 TCG MultiThreading for i386 guest doesn't work

Using any Linux image (in this case Alpine Linux iso) and want to use all cores of my Raspberry with --accel,thread=multi. I know there is a probably still problem with memory ordering of the host but I have also seen some very old commits which could potentially help with it.

But anyway, with version qemu-i386 version 3.1.0 (Debian 1:3.1+dfsg-7)
I can see OpenRC starting up services and then the kernel crash.

With version QEMU emulator version 3.1.93 (v4.0.0-rc3-dirty)
The whole machine crash with this error: 
Illegal instruction


Using command:
./qemu-system-i386 -cdrom alpine.iso --accel tcg,thread=multi

Full Console Output:
qemu-system-i386: warning: Guest expects a stronger memory ordering than the host provides
This may cause strange/hard to debug errors
Illegal instruction
