Cannot boot FreeBSD on versatilepb machine

I know some years ago it was possible to boot FreeBSD in QEMU versatilepb machine
https://kernelnomicon.org/?p=229 (you can download image and kernel using web.archive.org)
Now when I try to do that I get only black screen with no output even in QEMU console.
I also added -global versatile_pci.broken-irq-mapping=1, but this seem to have no effect.
