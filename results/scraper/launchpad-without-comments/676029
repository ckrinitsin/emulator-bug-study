Silently fail with wrong vde socket dir

Hi,

Using qemu 0.12.5, kvm silently fail with exit code 1 when using -net vde and a wrong path for sock. Actually, the sock option is mean to be the socket dir of the vde_switch, not the socket itself.

With -net vde,sock=/var/run/vde/vde0/ctl , strace ends with the following messages :

connect(7, {sa_family=AF_FILE, path="/var/run/vde/vde0/ctl/ctl"}, 110) = -1 ENOTDIR (Not a directory)
close(7)                                = 0
close(8)                                = 0
exit_group(1)                           = ?
root ~# 

Please add a meaningful message.

Regards,
Étienne
