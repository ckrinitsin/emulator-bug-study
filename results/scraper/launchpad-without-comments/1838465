qemu-system-x86_64 kernel panic 30% of the time starting up VM

I have created a Fedora Core 5 x86_64 VM image. When I run the image using QEMU on Windows the VM hangs while loading the kernel about 30% of the time. I am trying to use this VM with a CI software, looking at the history the build failed 27 out of 79 attempts. QEMU 3.0.0 is installed on the CI machine. I have tried using the exact same image using QEMU on Linux (Ubuntu) and found the image boot successful every time (40+ attempts). The VM image is fairly old it was created using QEMU 0.11.1.

I have tried multiple versions on QEMU on windows; 0.11.1, 2.12.1, and 3.0.0 all of them fail randomly. I can reproduce the issue on several different Windows 10 computers.

The command I am using to start the VM is “qemu-system-x86_64.exe -cpu qemu64 -smp cores=2 -device e1000,netdev=net0 -boot menu=off -m 1G -drive `"file=C:\qimages\Fedora-Core-5-x64.qcow2,index=0,media=disk`" -snapshot -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22”

I can provide the qcow image but it is somewhat large coming it at 4.15GB so I’m not sure what would be the best way to transfer it.
