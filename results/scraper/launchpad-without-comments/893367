HPET supports only one IRQ

The emulated HPET only supports triggering IRQ 2. Since MSIs are by default disabled, this severely limits the usefulness of the HPET as only one timer block can effectively be used (otherwise they would share IRQ 2). Ideally, the HPET should support as much timer blocks as CPUs and each timer block can be driven by a different IRQ.
