memory leak with config file

I have a Windows 7 SP1 Professional 64-bit installation on a QCOW2 image with compat=1.1, which I launch via

qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=windows_base_HDD.img,index=0,media=disk -enable-kvm -m 512M -vga std -net nic,vlan=0 -net user,vlan=0

As soon as I start using the network in any application — for example, visiting www.google.com in Internet Explorer — QEMU starts gobbling memory until the (host) kernel kills it because of an OOM condition.  If I run the QEMU with the same options, but with model=e1000 option set for the NIC (i.e. -net -nic,vlan=0,model=e1000), I can use the network from the guest OS without any noticeable effect on QEMU's memory consumption.

I do not have this problem when running QEMU with the exact same options (as above, without model=e1000) but with a Debian wheezy installation (on a QCOW image of the same format).  My host system in Ubuntu 13.10 x86_64, kernel image 3.11.0-17-generic, but with the QEMU packages from trusty (the codename for the next release):
Output of `dpkg -l \*qemu\* | grep '^ii'`:

(If necessary, I can try to reproduce this with QEMU built from the upstream source or the latest source from version control.)
