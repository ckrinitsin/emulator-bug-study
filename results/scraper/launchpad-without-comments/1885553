make-check test failed with "Segmentation fault"

While running the make-check testing on arm architecture the test failed with error:
"kill_qemu() detected QEMU death from signal 11 (Segmentation fault) (core dumped)". Apart from that make-install test always passes.
The problem doesn't reproduce in 100%
qemu - from the master branch
RHEL-8 kernel 4.18.0-221.el8.aarch64
Logfile with an error you can to find in attachment

Thanks
