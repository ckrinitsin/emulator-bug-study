keyboard input while mouse moving triggers mouse failure

When QEMU is getting a ton of mouse input events if keys are pressed on the keyboard the scan code will be corrupted causing erroneous behavior. I have confirmed this problem in the latest version in git (530049bc1dcc24c1178a29d99ca08b6dd08413e0).

After the erroneous behavior the operating system issues a keyboard reset which prevents the mouse from functioning until the operating system is restarted.

This seems to only occur if the PS2 mouse is being used as the input, the tablet input device doesn't exhibit this behavior.

The same problem was reported here also: https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-562
