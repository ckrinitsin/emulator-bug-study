local/9pfs: Too many levels of symbolic links

Version: 2.9.1

The primary symptom is resolving symlink fails w/ error "too many levels of symbolic links".

My analysis showed that local_readlink() uses local_open_nofollow() to open the file and then tries to read it. local_open_nofollow() then tries to open the file w/ O_NOFOLLOW, which obviously fails if the requested file is a symlink.
