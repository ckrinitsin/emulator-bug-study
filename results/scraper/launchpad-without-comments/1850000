4.1.0 bogus QCOW2 corruption reported after compress

Creating a compressed image then running `qemu-img check <..>.qcow2' on said image seems to report bogus corruption in some (but not all) cases:

Step 1.

# qemu-img info win7-base.qcow2
image: win7-base.qcow2
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 20 GiB (21474836480 bytes)
disk size: 12.2 GiB
cluster_size: 65536
Format specific information:
    compat: 1.1
    lazy refcounts: true
    refcount bits: 16
    corrupt: false

# qemu-img check win7-base.qcow2
No errors were found on the image.
327680/327680 = 100.00% allocated, 0.00% fragmented, 0.00% compressed clusters
Image end offset: 21478375424

Step 2.

# qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 -c win7-base.qcow2 test1-z.qcow2

Step 3.

# qemu-img info test1-z.qcow2
image: test1-z.qcow2
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 20 GiB (21474836480 bytes)
disk size: 5.78 GiB
cluster_size: 65536
Format specific information:
    compat: 1.1
    lazy refcounts: false
    refcount bits: 16
    corrupt: false

# qemu-img check test1-z.qcow2

20503 errors were found on the image.
Data may be corrupted, or further writes to the image may corrupt it.

20503 leaked clusters were found on the image.
This means waste of disk space, but no harm to data.
197000/327680 = 60.12% allocated, 89.32% fragmented, 88.50% compressed clusters

The resultant image seems to work fine in a VM when used as a backing file.

Interestingly, if I substitute a qemu-img binary from qemu-4.0 then no errors are reported.

# /tmp/qemu-img check test1-z.qcow2
No errors were found on the image.
197000/327680 = 60.12% allocated, 89.32% fragmented, 88.50% compressed clusters
Image end offset: 6216220672

Is the image corrupted or not? I'm guessing not.

Just in case it matters, this is ext4 fs on rotational disk. Latest Arch Linux but self compiled 4.1.0 with recent QCOW2 corruption fixes added.

I haven't tried latest trunk but might do so if time permits.
