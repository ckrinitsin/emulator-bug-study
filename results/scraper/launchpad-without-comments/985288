scsi disk emulation doesn't enforce FUA (Force Unit Access) in write-back mode

Microsoft NTFS utilizes the FUA bit in SCSI WRITE CDBs to insure integrity when a device advertises that it has write caching enabled.  The FUA bit is meant to ensure a write is written to non-volatile storage before returning.  This seems to not be enforced by QEMU's SCSI emulation code.
