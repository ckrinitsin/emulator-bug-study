qemu-system-aarch64 can't run Windows 10 for ARM version 2004

Problem: qemu-system-aarch64 can't run Windows 10 for ARM version 2004 (20H2) or newer

Host OS: Windows 10 x64 version 20H2
CPU    : Intel Pentium Dual-core T4300 (no vt-x)
QEMU   : QEMU version 5.1.0 from qemu.org

cmdline: qemu-system-aarch64.exe -M virt -cpu cortex-a72 -smp 3 --accel tcg,thread=multi -m 2048 -pflash QEMU_EFI.img -pflash QEMU_VARS.img -device VGA -device nec-usb-xhci -device usb-kbd -device usb-mouse -device usb-storage,drive=cdrom -drive file="isofile.iso",media=cdrom,if=none,id=cdrom

Note: QEMU_VARS and QEMU_EFI are taken from edk2, which can be seen in the attachment below.

Details: From this post (https://kitsunemimi.pw/notes/posts/running-windows-10-for-arm64-in-a-qemu-virtual-machine.html) and from what I have tried, QEMU can't run Windows ARM newer or equal to the 2004 version. When we boot a 2004 iso (made from uupdump.ml), it stuck as the boot screen with the Windows ARM logo and nothing else. When I check the machine state and registers through the QEMU monitor, it shows that the VM is still running, but the registers are completely frozen! But if I try the older version, like 19H2, it works! Please help!
