Compilation fails with "ld: Error: unable to disambiguate: -no-pie (did you mean --no-pie ?)"

It compiles until the end and then just:
[6102/6103] Linking target qemu-system-alpha
[6103/6103] Linking target qemu-system-aarch64
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/t/.cache/kiss/proc/32129/build/qemu/build'
make: *** [GNUmakefile:11: all] Error 2

Attached is the complete log including configure. I can't find why this is happening maybe I have a wrong version of a required library?

Any ideas?
