dtc crash; pnv_dt_serial cannot find lpc's phandle

pnv_dt_serial has a line which is supposed to set the interrupt-parent of the "isa-serial@i3f8" node to the phandle of "lpc@0". 

To that end, it calls fdt_get_phandle as shown below:
_FDT((fdt_setprop_cell(fdt, node, "interrupt-parent", fdt_get_phandle(fdt, lpc_off))));

The function fdt_get_phandle fails to find the property "phandle" (or "linux,phandle") for the lpc node. Consequently, pnv_dt_serial sets the interrupt-parent to 0.





Now boot the qemu-system-ppc64 powernv machine, and extract the fdt by using the qemu monitor's pmemsave command, taking help of the OPAL firmware's messages to locate the fdt in the physical ram.

qemu-system-ppc64 -m 1g -machine powernv,num-chips=1 \  
-cpu power9 -smp 2,cores=2,threads=1 -accel tcg,thread=multi \                  
-kernel ./vmlinux \                                                             
-append 'disable_radix' \                                                       
-serial mon:stdio -nographic -nodefaults 

The kernel vmlinux contains nothing but a single instruction which loops infintely, so that we can gather OPAL's messages, especially the one below:

[    0.168845963,5] INIT: Starting kernel at 0x20000000, fdt at 0x304b0b70 14404 bytes





Once the fdt is dumped to a file, run the following:

'dtc -O dtb -I dts -o out.dts dtb'


After a few warnings, the dtc application crashes because an assertion was fired.

1.dts: Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): /lpcm-opb@6030000000000/lpc@0: node has a unit name, but no reg property
1.dts: Warning (simple_bus_reg): /lpcm-opb@6030000000000/lpc@0: missing or empty reg/ranges property
1.dts: Warning (avoid_unnecessary_addr_size): /ibm,opal: unnecessary #address-cells/#size-cells without "ranges" or child "reg" property
1.dts: Warning (unique_unit_address): /interrupt-controller@0: duplicate unit-address (also used in node /memory@0)
1.dts: Warning (chosen_node_stdout_path): /chosen:linux,stdout-path: Use 'stdout-path' instead
dtc: livetree.c:575: get_node_by_phandle: Assertion `generate_fixups' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)



The assertion is fired because get_node_by_phandle receives a phandle value of 0, which is unexpected, unless fixups are needed (They are not, when running the dtc command).




Back inside pnv_dt_serial, if the line that sets "interrupt-parent" for the serial device node is commented out, the dtc crash is prevented. Looking at hw/ppc/e500.c, it takes care of allocating necessary phandle values in the nodes, so a similar method can be adopted for powernv.


The dtb is attached.
