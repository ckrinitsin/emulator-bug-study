Cannot build QEMU on RHEL6 because of MAP_HUGETLB

Hello,
I've just downloaded qemu-2.11.0 sources and I wanted to build QEMU on RHEL6 x86_64, for various targets, amonst which arm-linux-user.

The build fails because /usr/include/bits/mman.h does not define MAP_HUGETLB.

I think it is needed since commit 541e16904.

I'm not sure if RHEL6 is still supported by QEMU? If so, can you fix this problem?

Thanks
