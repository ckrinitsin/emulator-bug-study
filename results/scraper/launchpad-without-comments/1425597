moving window + changing screen resolution = bug

Steps to reproduce:
1. Run qemu (sdl)
2. Start moving the window
3. At that moment the virtualized OS should change its screen resolution (for example, when switching from initial qemu screen to grub)

What I see:
Window size doesn't change, but internal screen resolution changes, so, image scale stops to be 1:1, now I see virtualized OS in wrong scale.

What I expected to see:
Window size changes so, that it keeps synchronized with internal resolution (as usual)

This bug preserves at lastest git version at the moment, i. e. 3d30395f7fb3315e4ecf0de4e48790e1326bbd47
