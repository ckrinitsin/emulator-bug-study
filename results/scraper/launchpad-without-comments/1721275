Support more ARM CPUs

Hi,

This is an enhancement request, rather than a bug report.

After some discussions/presentations during the last Linaro Connect (SFO17), I understand that it may be easy to add support for more ARM CPUs in QEMU. I am interested in user-mode, if that matters.

I'm primarily using QEMU for GCC validations, and I'd like to make sure that GCC doesn't generate instructions not supported by the CPU it's supposed to generate code for.

I'd like to have:
cortex-m0
cortex-m4
cortex-m7
cortex-m23
cortex-m33

cortex-a35
cortex-a53
cortex-a57

Is it possible?
Is it the right place to ask?
Should I file separate requests for each?

Thanks
