qemu-system-x86_64.exe -m 512 -net nic -net tap,ifname=tap01 -hda "c:\\data\\images\\test.img"

where the image contains a slackware 14.0 64bit install.
The tap is bridged with the real network adapter and the bridge is given an ip of 10.1.1.41 (which works as the ip for the windows host). The tap adapter (in network connections) shows connected when the qemu vm is running. inside the vm, the network is given an ip of 10.1.1.143 (the netmask and default gateway are the same for the virtual and real pc).
fault.
The vm cannot see the rest of the local network or visa-versa. This used to work in early (0.9 32bit) versions of qemu.
