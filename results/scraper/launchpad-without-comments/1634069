Exclude keys from grab

Feature request: pressing every time a shortcut to release grab for switching windows/desktops is pretty annoying, especially for users of tiling WMs.

QEMU have to have a way to specify keys or shortcuts (possibly something like "everything with the specified modifier key"), which would not be intercepted.
