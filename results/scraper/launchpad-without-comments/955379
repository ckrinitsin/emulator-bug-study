cmake hangs with qemu-arm-static

I'm using git commit 3e7ecd976b06f... configured with --target-list=arm-linux-user --static in a chroot environment to compile some things. I ran into this problem with both pcl and opencv-2.3.1. cmake consistently freezes at some point during its execution, though in a different spot each time, usually during a step when it's searching for some libraries. For instance, pcl most commonly stops after:

[snip]
-- Boost version: 1.46.1
-- Found the following Boost libraries:
--   system
--   filesystem
--   thread
--   date_time
-- checking for module 'eigen3'
--   found eigen3, version 3.0.1

which is perplexing because it freezes after finding what it wants, not during the search. When it does get past that point, it does so almost immediately but freezes somewhere else. 

I'm using 64-bit Ubuntu 11.10 with kernel release 3.0.0-16-generic with an Intel i5.
