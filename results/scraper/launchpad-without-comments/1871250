Failed to create HAX VM

Hi,

I'm running the latest (master) of QEMU, though the version doesn't seem to matter - I also checked back to v4.2.0, exactly the same issue. And this isn't about the VM (guest), if I even just try to run,

> "c:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe" -accel hax

Basically, just get a window to open, with acceleration enabled ... I get,
Open the vm device error:/dev/hax_vm/vm00, ec:3
Failed to open vm 0
Failed to create HAX VM
No accelerator found.

But I checked - I have installed Intel HAXM, and verified it's running,
> sc query intelhaxm
SERVICE_NAME: intelhaxm
        TYPE               : 1  KERNEL_DRIVER
        STATE              : 4  RUNNING
                                (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0

Just remove the accelerator (-accel hax), and I get a window - so this is related to QEMU being able to contact / use the accelerator.

Help!?!?

Thanks!
