Intel GVT-g works in X11, segfaults in wayland

Hello,

I am using an uptodate Arch Linux 64bit with qemu version 4.2.0, but the problem was also present in older versions. The problem occurs with Linux 5.4 and 4.19.
The problem also occurs with Debian as guest. I am running sway.
If I provide -vga std, then qemu works fine until I use the qemu window to switch to the vfio-pci device. There are no problems under X11/xwayland at all.


Commandline:
qemu-system-x86_64
    -enable-kvm
    -cpu host
    -smp 2
    -m 8192
    -display gtk,gl=on
    -device vfio-pci,sysfsdev=/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/[ID]/,x-igd-opregion=on,display=on
    -cdrom archlinux-2019.11.01-x86_64.iso
    -vga none
