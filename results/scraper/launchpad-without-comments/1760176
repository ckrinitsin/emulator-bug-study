optical drive doesn't open in Lubuntu 18.04 on '12 MacPro

Running an install to HD of Lubuntu 18.04 and after running update/upgrade this morning now the optical drive door doesn't respond to keyboard "eject" key on a Mac keyboard for '12 MacPro . . . .  I tried to use "xfburn" to get the door to open, nothing seems to get it to work that I know of.  Yesterday there was no issue . . . .  Tried to run "apt -f install" and it showed some old kernels to "autoremove" . . . which I did; didn't try to reboot into old kernel to test, perhaps now old kernel is gone?
