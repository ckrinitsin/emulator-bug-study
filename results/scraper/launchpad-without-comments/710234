Qemu segfaults at start regardles if i suply an image or not

I have tried both with latest development (git clone git://git.qemu.org/qemu.git ran around 12:00 2011-01-30) and with  qemu-0.13.0. Since i have not written c-code in the last years, and never really ran a debugger under Linux this will bug report will be a bit sketchy.

When starting qemu, either just qemu or with an image it segfaults. The Qemu window flashes by and then i get the segfault message (qemu -nographic still segfaults so i guess it is not really graphics related).   When starting qemu with a garbled command line it returns an error and exits normally how ever.

uname -a
Linux LIX 2.6.33.4-smp #2 SMP Wed May 12 22:47:36 CDT 2010 i686 AMD Phenom(tm) II X4 810 Processor AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux

I have tried recompiling with --disable-kvm since i run a 32 bit OS on a 64 bit CPU, but to no avail.
