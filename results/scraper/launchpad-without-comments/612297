qemu-kvm fails to detect mouse while Windows 95 setup

CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 945
KVM-Version: qemu-kvm-0.12.4+dfsg (Debian package)
Kernel: linux-2.6.26.8-rt16
arch: x86_64
Guest: Windows 95 B

I'm trying to install Windows 95 B on qemu-kvm with this options:

kvm /var/mmn/vm/Win95/Win95.img -name "Windows 95" -M pc-0.12 -m 512M -rtc base=localtime -k de -soundhw sb16 -vga cirrus -net user,hostname=w95vm -net nic,model=ne2k_pci -boot a -fda /var/mmn/vm/floppy/win95B_Drive-D-boot.img -cdrom /var/mmn/vm/CD/win95-setup.iso -no-acpi -no-kvm -usb

I've also tried some other option, but always the same: no ps/2 mouse detection. And usb mouse is not supported by Windows 95 B while setup process. This is only possible later by installing the extension usbsupp.exe after the system setup.
