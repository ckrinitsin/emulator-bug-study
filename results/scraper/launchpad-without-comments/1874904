qemu windows with gtk and french keypad not working as expected

When I use qemu on Windows 10 with a French AZERTY keypad with the correct options the emulated system keypad still QWERTY. If we use sdl it works fine the emulated keypad is AZERTY.

Example of command with ubuntu live cd:
-> qemu-system-x86_64.exe  -m 4G ubuntu-18.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso -display gtk -k fr

NOTES:
 - Using the same command on Linux works fine. The emulated keypad is AZERTY.

Qemu version : 4.2.0 on Windows 10
