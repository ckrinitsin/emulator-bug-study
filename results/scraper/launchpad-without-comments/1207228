Qemu (trunk code) crashes when using --soundhw all option in ioport.c

After not building qemu (git version) for about 3 weeks, I've done it again this morning.

With up-to-date trunk code, I got this error on start, when using --soundhw all option

$ qemu-system-i386 -soundhw all
qemu-system-i386: /home/fred/Téléchargements/logs/qemu-git/src/qemu/ioport.c:240: portio_list_add: Assertion `pio->offset >= off_last' failed.
Abandon (core dumped)

And if I use only soundhw with one or more options, it doesn't crash.

Tell me what you'll need to fix this bug.
