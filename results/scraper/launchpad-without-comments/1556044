Redox GUI hangs with 100% CPU on ARM

Booting into Redox OS cli on ARM with qemu-system-i386 works fine. However, starting the Redox GUI (orbital) brings up the graphical interface and then starts using 100% CPU. I'd guess it's related to mouse detection and handling.

The OS image is fully usable on x86.
