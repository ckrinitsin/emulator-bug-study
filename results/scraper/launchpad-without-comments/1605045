input-linux enter key stuck and/or broken

Using new input-linux evdev passthrough feature of qemu (qemu 2.6.0) causes enter key to be stuck down after executing a shell script to launch qemu guest, resulting in repeated new lines in terminal. After a certain point of guest boot, the enter key is no longer pressed. However, at least under Gnome on Wayland, when pressing both left+right Ctrl keys to return keyboard back to the host, the enter key no longer functions. The enter key continues to function when control is under the guest, but never returns to functionality in the host until a reboot is performed.
