FDC reset should reset the MSR

I believe that the MSR resgister should also be reset to zero on a software reset.  All of the FDC hardware I have does this.
The current code leaves the MSR as 0x80, which means that the controller is ready for a write.  The controller should not
be ready for a write while in reset.

fdc.c Line 899
    /* Reset */
    if (!(value & FD_DOR_nRESET)) {
 +      fdctrl->msr = 0x00;
        if (fdctrl->dor & FD_DOR_nRESET) {
            FLOPPY_DPRINTF("controller enter RESET state\n");
        }
    } else {
