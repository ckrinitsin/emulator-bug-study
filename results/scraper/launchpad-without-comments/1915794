could not load PC BIOS 'bios-256k.bin' on latest Windows exe (*-20210203.exe)

I'm using https://scoop.sh/ to install QEMU on a Windows CI job, which is run daily. Since today, the job is failing with an `could not load PC BIOS 'bios-256k.bin'` error thrown by QEMU.

The version that causes this error is: https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/2021/qemu-w64-setup-20210203.exe#/dl.7z
The previous version, which worked fine, was: https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/2020/qemu-w64-setup-20201124.exe#/dl.7z

Both CI runs build the exact same code. You can find the full logs at https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/runs/1908137213?check_suite_focus=true (failing) and https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/runs/1900698412?check_suite_focus=true (previous).

(I hope this is the right place to report this issue.)
