Networking in qemu 2.0.0 and beyond is not compatible with Open Solaris (Illumos) 5.11

The networking code in qemu in versions 2.0.0 and beyond is non-functional with Solaris/Illumos 5.11 images. 

Building 1.7.1, 2.0.0, 2.0.2, 2.1.2,and 2.2.0rc1with the following standard Slackware config:

# From Slackware build tree . . . 
./configure \
  --prefix=/usr \
  --libdir=/usr/lib64 \
  --sysconfdir=/etc \
  --localstatedir=/var \
  --enable-gtk \
  --enable-system \
  --enable-kvm \
  --disable-debug-info \
  --enable-virtfs \
  --enable-sdl \
  --audio-drv-list=alsa,oss,sdl,esd \
  --enable-libusb \
  --disable-vnc \
  --target-list=x86_64-linux-user,i386-linux-user,x86_64-softmmu,i386-softmmu \
  --enable-spice \
  --enable-usb-redir 


And attempting to run the same VM image with the following command (or via virt-manager):

macaddress="DE:AD:BE:EF:3F:A4"

qemu-system-x86_64 nex4x -cdrom /dev/cdrom -name "Nex41" -cpu Westmere
-machine accel=kvm -smp 2 -m 4000 -net nic,macaddr=$macaddress  -net bridge,br=b
r0 -net dump,file=/usr1/tmp/<FILENAME> -drive file=nex4x_d1 -drive file=nex4x_d2
 -enable-kvm

Gives success on 1.7.1, and a deaf VM on all subsequent versions. 

Notable in validating my config, is that a Windows 7 image runs cleanly with networking on *all* builds, so my configuration appears to be good - qemu just hates Solaris at this point.

Watching with wireshark (as well as pulling network traces from qemu as noted above) it appears that the notable difference in the two configs is that for some reason, Solaris gets stuck arping for it's own interface on startup, and never really comes on line on the network.  If other hosts attempt to ping the Solaris instance, they can successfully arp the bad VM, but not the other way around.
