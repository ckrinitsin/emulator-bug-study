something wrong in function type_initialize() in object.c in the source code of qemu-1.1.0

In the function type_initialize() in file object.c, about line 237, the sentence : 
    memset((void *)ti->class + class_size, 0, ti->class_size - class_size);
after the 
   if (type_has_parent(ti)){}
will clean the information copied from the parent in the if block.
I'm wondering whether this will lead to a bug. Thanks.
