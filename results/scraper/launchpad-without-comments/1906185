Guest display resolution cannot be changed when using certain graphics/interface combinations

Guest display resolution cannot be changed with certain virtual graphics card (-vga) and interface (-display) combinations.

For example, resolution changing doesn't work with the following QEMU start commands, it resets to the default resolution immediately:

QXL with SDL interface:
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 6G -cpu host -smp 3 -cdrom ./linux/kubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso -boot d -vga qxl -soundhw hda -display sdl

QXL with GTK interface:
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 6G -cpu host -smp 3 -cdrom ./linux/kubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso -boot d -vga qxl -soundhw hda -display gtk

QXL with "remote" SPICE interface via unix socket:
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 6G -cpu host -smp 3 -cdrom ./linux/kubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso -boot d -soundhw hda -vga qxl -device virtio-serial-pci -device virtserialport,chardev=spicechannel0,name=com.redhat.spice.0 -chardev spicevmc,id=spicechannel0,name=vdagent -spice unix,addr=/tmp/vm_spice.socket,disable-ticketing

for "remote" access:
remote-viewer spice+unix:///tmp/vm_spice.socket



Other tested combinations:
-- virtio + SDL (GL on): works!
-- virtio + GTK (GL on): does not work properly. The resolution is changed but window size is not so the guest screen will look like garbage.
-- vmware: The initial Kubuntu setup screen is visible but booting does not progress to the desktop
-- std + GTK: works!
-- std + SDL: works!
