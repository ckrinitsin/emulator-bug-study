qemu-arm-static crashes "segmentation fault" when running "git clone -s"

I want to use qemu-arm-static to cross-compile software. The compiler itself is a native cross-compiler connected via "distcc".

The problem is that a script tries to do some stuff with "git" and with a "git clone -s" command the whole story reproducibly stops with a "segmentation fault".

I don't know how to properly debug the issue but it happens 100% of the time that I get the "crash" or git just hangs forever with 100% CPU usage.
