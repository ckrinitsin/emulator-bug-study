QEMU video freezes with "Guest disabled display" (virtio driver)

I am using Arch Linux as my Guest and Host OS, after starting qemu with the following command:

  $ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -hda arch-zoom.qcow2 -m 4G -vga virtio

and waiting for a screen blank, I get this message:

  Guest disabled display

And nothing happens after that, I can move the mouse or hit any key, and the message is still there.

I can still reboot the VM but that's not optimal.

I can reproduce this with the latest QEMU release (5.0.0) or git master, 
I also tried this with older releases (4.0.0, 3.0.0) and the issue is still there.

I can't reproduce this with other video drivers (std, qxl).

With std/qxl the screen will blank a bit and then continue as normal.
