[ppc64le] qemu behavior differs from ppc64le hardware

I have some code which passes my test suite on PPC64LE hardware when compiled with GCC 10, but the saem binary fails with both qemu-ppc64le 4.2 (on Fedora 32) and qemu-ppc64le-static 5.0.0 (Debian testing).

I'm not getting any errors about illegal instructions or anything, like that; the results are just silently different on qemu.

I've generated a reduced test case, which is attached along with the binaries (both are the same code, one is just statically linked).  They should execute successufully on PPC64LE hardware, but on qemu they hit a __builtin_abort (because the computed value doesn't match the expected value).

Without being familiar with PPC assembly I'm not sure what else I can do, but if there is anything please let me know.
