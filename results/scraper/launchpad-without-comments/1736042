qemu-system-x86_64 does not boot image reliably

Booting image as root user with following command works randomly.

./qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -curses -smp cpus=4 -m 8192 /root/ructfe2917_g.qcow2

Most of the time it ends up on "800x600 Graphic mode"(been stuck there even for 4 hours before killed), but 1 out of ~20 it boots image correctly(and instantly).

This is visible in v2.5.0 build from sources, v2.5.0 from Ubuntu Xenial and v2.1.2 from Debian Jessie.

The image in question was converted from vmdk using:

qemu-img convert -O qcow2 file.vmdk file.qcow2

The image contains Ubuntu with grub.

I can provide debug logs, but will need guidance how to enable them(and what logs are necessary).

As a side note, it seems that booting is more certain after connecting(or mounting) partition using qemu-nbd/mount.
