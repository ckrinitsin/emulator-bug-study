qemu-img convert is freezing for some DMG files.

Recently, I created a file using hdiutil from MacOS (using Zlib compression):

$ hdiutil create -volname MyVolName -srcfolder /path/to/my/vol/ -ov -format UDZO myvolname.dmg

But, when I try to convert this volume using qemu-img convert, this command is freezing.

I'm using the upstream version to test it.

It is freezing inside the binary search method to retrieve the chunk.

But, I still don't know why.

I'm attaching the file as an example.

It can be mounted using MacOS or other Linux apps like hfsleuth and darling-dmg.
