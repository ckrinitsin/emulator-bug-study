qemu uses a bitmap icon

qemu currently uses the icon in pc-bios/qemu-icon.bmp, which, obviously, is a bitmap file. It is loaded such that white pixels will be transparent. This can cause nasty artifacts in the display.

Unless there is a specific reason to use bitmaps, I'd suggest moving to, e.g., a PNG file with a proper alpha channel.
