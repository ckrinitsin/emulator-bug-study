older OS's do not detect CD change

There are at least two older operating systems, being FreeBSD 2.2 and FreeDOS 1.2, that misbehave when the change command is used on the IDE CD drive, and work fine on a real machine.  In both cases, changing the CD causes the guest to either refuse to read the disc or appear to read bad data, and in both cases the guest read the disc without issue after a system_reset.

A HD image that demonstrates this behavior can be produced if necessary, however the FreeDOS 1.2 CD can be booted directly and used to test:

(choose install then abort and you get a prompt in which you can type "dir D:", say)

note, running eject before the change command does nothing to help.
