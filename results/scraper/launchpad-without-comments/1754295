Incorrect en-us keymap in QEMU 2.11

I'm using the latest Arch Linux installation ISO as a live system and start QEMU with the following command:

$ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -boot d -cdrom ~/isos/archlinux-2018.03.01-x86_64.iso -m 512 -vnc :0 -k en-us

Then I use Vinagre to connect to the guest system, boot the default bootloader option, and type the character '<' at the command prompt. The guest prints the character '>' instead of the '<' I typed.

I believe this is caused by the updated en-us keymap in QEMU 2.11. [1]

If I start QEMU with `-k en-gb` (or without the -k switch at all), I can type '<' and get the same character to appear on the guest's command line. The issue happens with the updated en-us keymap. It is also fixed if I replace /usr/share/qemu/keymaps/en-us with the old keymap file (before commit a7815faf).

This problem was originally reported against Packer because we were seeing '>' characters in place of '<' when using it with the QEMU builder. [2]
