nic e1000 network interface does not work with 32-bit windows 2003r2 with  sp2

nic e1000 network interface does not work with win2k3r2 32bit

e1000 driver in win2k3r2 32bit seems to be broken. The interface is able to
receive ip from the dhcp server, but not able to ping it from any linux guest or
host, but was able to ping it from windows guest.

Running network test, netperf, between the windows guest fails with the message 
"netperf: receive_response: no response received. errno 104 counter 0"

cmdline used:
/usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=win2003r2sp2-32.raw,boot=on -net nic,vlan=0,macaddr=20:20:20:00:00:04,model=e1000  -net tap,vlan=0,script=/home/yogi/qemu-ifup  -m 2048 -enable-kvm  -usbdevice tablet -vnc :1
