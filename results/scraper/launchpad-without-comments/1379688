qemu's monitor and parallel create huge window

I have qemu 2.1. When I try to switch to monitor or parallel0, I get window which is 30 *thousand* pixels in height. It is only gray with no content. This did not happen with previous versions of qemu.

Kwin crashes because it cannot handle such a huge window.
