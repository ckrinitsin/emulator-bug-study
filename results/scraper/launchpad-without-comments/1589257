Boot with OVMF extremely slow to bootloader

I have used Arch Linux in the past with the same version (2.5.0), the exact same OVMF code and vars, and the exact same VM settings with no issues. Now with Ubuntu, I am having the issue where boot up until Windows takes about 10x longer. Every CPU thread/core allocated gets used 100% while this is happening. After that, everything operates as normal. There is no abnormal logs produced by qemu, or I don't know how to debug.

Here are my settings:

Host:
Ubuntu 16.04
Qemu 2.5.0
Relevant configs attached

Guest:
Windows 10
VirtIO raw disk image
VirtIO network
Typical VGA passthrough setup, everything operating normally
