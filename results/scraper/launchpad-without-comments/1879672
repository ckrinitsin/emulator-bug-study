QEMU installer with WHPX support

People often ask the community to add WHPX support to the QEMU installer for Windows,
but it is impossible due to the license limitations of the WHPX SDK.

The WinHvEmulation.h and WinHvPlatform.h header files needed are "All
rights reserved".

However these headers only contain struct definitions and integer constants,
no functional code in macros or inline functions. See:

It is questionable whether the headers alone can be considered copyrightable material.
