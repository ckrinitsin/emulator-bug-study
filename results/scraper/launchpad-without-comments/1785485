Mouse moves erratically when using scroll wheel on Windows NT 4, Windows 95, and Windows 3.1 guests

QEMU version: 3.0.0 RC3
Guests: Windows NT 4.0, Windows 95, Windows 3.1

Program: When the user uses the scroll wheel, the mouse's movement becomes erratic. 

This is noticed immediately when the scroll wheel is used. Sometimes the problem can be fixed by moving the scroll wheel some more.

My theory is this problem is because of the lack of support for the Microsoft Intellimouse in these guest operating systems.
