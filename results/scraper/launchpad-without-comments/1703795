Unable to release mouse in SDL2 mode

Starting with commit 8f4ea9cd0b770dbe496d9d24f0ef8813fdbfe0d0 "sdl: prefer sdl2 over sdl1", I can no longer release mouse pointer grab unless I use --with-sdlabi=1.2 configure option.

This easily reproduces in e.g. guest Kubuntu, when I let it start Xorg and then click into the QEMU window. After this the mouse is trapped and no matter how I combine Ctrl+Alt and motion of the cursor, the pointer never goes out from the window. When at the border, QEMU window switches from "Press Ctrl+Alt to exit grab" to "QEMU", i.e. it thinks that it has released the grab. But it hasn't really, so I have to go to VT1 and do "pkill qemu" from there to get my pointer back.
