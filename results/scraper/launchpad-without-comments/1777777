arm9 clock pending (SP804)

Hello all,

I'm using the versatilepb board and the timer Interrupt Mask Status register (offset 0x14 of the SP804) does not seem to be working properly on the latest qemu-2.12. I tried on the 2.5 (i believe this is the mainstream version that comes with Linux) and it works perfectly.

What happens is that the pending bit does not seem to be set in some scenarios. In my case, I see the timer value decreasing to 0 and then being reset to the reload value and neither does the interrupt is triggered nor the pending bit is set.

I believe this is a matter of timing since in the "long" run the system eventually catches up (after a few microseconds).

Thank you
