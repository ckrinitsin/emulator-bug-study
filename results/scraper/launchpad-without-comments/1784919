native libgfapi  glusterfs support for virtio 9p filesystem passthrough

I can add block devices on glusterfs natively to my virtual machines since qemu 1.3 
I would like to see the same feature for virtio 9p filesystems added on my VM. 

Accessing a filesystem mounted on the Metal is my favorite solution for storage that is to be shared between more than one VM. But because my VMs are not running as root, they are not able to passthrough userids and gids to gluster-fuse. uid mapping is also not possible because no xattr support. 

So all I can do is either setting up seperate NFS Servers to bring the Filesystem in via Network, or to start qemu as root or to add fuse_xattr on top of glusterfs_fuse. I do expect however that the fastest and most relieable solution is to make something like this possible: 

-fsdev local,id=test_dev,path=gluster://this.node/test_mount,security_model=passthrough -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=test_dev,mount_tag=test_mount
