Hint showing volume never disappears, blocking buttons to minimize, maximize and close

When hovering the mouse over the volume indicator or changing its volume using the mouse wheel it shows the current volume set as a hint. For example:

Volume 100%

The problem is that the hint never disappears, not even clicking on it. On some occasions the hint can cover the minimize, maximize and close buttons, causing significant problems on using the desktop environment, as these three buttons won't be usable anymore with the hint over it.

Where the hint appears it's no longer possible to interact with the screen.
