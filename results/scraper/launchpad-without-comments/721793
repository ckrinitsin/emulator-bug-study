QEMU freezes on startup (100% CPU utilization)

0.12.5 was the last version of QEMU that runs ok and boots any os image.

0.13.0-0.14.0 just freeze, and the only thing I see is a black screen and both of them make it use 100% of CPU also.
Both kernels 2.6.35.11 and 2.6.37.1 with and without PAE support.

tested commands:

W2000:
$ qemu -m 256 -localtime -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net tap -usbdevice host:0e21:0750 /var/opt/vm/w2000.img
W2000:
$ qemu /var/opt/vm/w2000.img
OpenBSD 4.8:
$ qemu -cdrom ~/cd48.iso -boot d empty-qcow2.img

tried to use `-M pc-0.12` selector, different audio cards (I've found it caused infinite loop on startup once) -- no luck.
tried to use recent seabios from git -- still no luck.

attached strace log of 0.14.0.

everything was tested on HP mini 311C with Intel Atom N270.
