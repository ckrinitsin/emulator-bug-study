qemu-nbd: always first snapshot loaded from VDI images with snapshots

When mounting a virtual box disk image of a VM with snapshots, always the state of the first snapshot is shown.

How to reproduce:
1. Create a new VirtualBox VM or use an existing one, while choosing VDI as the disk image format.
2. Create a snapshot of the VM.
3. Modify the file system from within the VM enough that differences to the snapshotted version are apparent.
4. Create another snapshot.
5. Shut down the VM.
6. Mount the partition from the disk image with `qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 /path/to/disk.vdi; mount /dev/nbd0pX /mnt`

Expected result: The mounted disk image shall represent the latest state of the VM
Actual result: The mounted disk image represents the VM state at the first snapshot
