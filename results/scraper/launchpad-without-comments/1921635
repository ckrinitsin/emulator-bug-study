ESP SCSI adapter not working with DOS ASPI drivers

I have been trying to install the DOS ASPI drivers for the ESP scsi card. Both in am53c974 and dc390 modes. Neither works but they don't work in different ways.

The following things appear to be problematic:

* The am53c974 should work with the PcSCSI drivers (AMSIDA.SYS) but the ASPI driver never manages to get past initializing the card. The VM never continues.
* The dc390 ASPI driver fares a little better. The ASPI driver loads and is semi-functional but the drivers for the peripherals don't work.
 - ASPI.SYS (creative name) loads
 - TRMDISK.SYS fails to load when a cd-drive is attached and will crashs scanning the scsi-id where the cd drive is attached
 - TRMDISK.SYS loads without a CD drive attached but fails to read any scsi-hd devices attached. The TFDISK.EXE formatter crashes.
 - TRMCD.SYS loads, but can not detect any CD drives.

The various permutations:
am53c974 hang on ASPI driver load: (CD only attached)

dc390 crash because of CDROM attachment and loading TRMDISK.SYS (Only CD attached)

All of these tests were done on 7b9a3c9f94bcac23c534bc9f42a9e914b433b299 as well as the 'esp-next' branch found here: https://github.com/mcayland/qemu/tree/esp-next

The bios file is a seabios master with all int13 support disabled. With it enabled even less works but I figured this would be a seabios bug and not a qemu one.

The actual iso and qcow2 files used don't appear the matter. the 'small.qcow2' is an empty drive of 100MB. I have also tried other ISOs in the CD drives, or even not put any cd in the drives with the same results.

I will attach all of the above images.
