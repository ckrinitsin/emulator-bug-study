UART problem in raspi2

I was trying to run the raspberry pi uart example at https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi/tree/master/uart01 using qemu 2.6.0, but it didn't work.

The steps I took were:
* Edit uart01/memmap and change origin to 0x10000 (which is the address qemu starts executing),
* make
* /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-arm -machine raspi2 -m 512M -nographic -gdb tcp::26000 -S -kernel uart01.bin

Then start arm-none-eabi-gdb and run following commands:

target remote localhost:26000
symbol-file ./uart01.elf


Then, when I start the program, it seems that the GET32(AUX_MU_LSR_REG)&0x20 condition never becomes true.

This works on actual hardware, so I am wondering if I'm doing any steps incorrectly or missing.
