CPU not support 32-bit stack in 32-bit unreal mode

QEMU version 5.0.0 supports 32-bit and 16-bit unreal mode. Great!
Unfortunately, QEMU does not support 32-bit stack in unreal 32-bit mode.
After the INT instruction, the stack is switched to 16-bit, which should not be the case. 
At BOCHS, my code works 100%. At QEMU not works.

Sample code to find out:

use32
cli
mov ax,cs
shl eax,16
mov ax,NewInt80h
mov [IDT32+4*80h],eax
mov edx,esp
mov esp,0x10000
int 80h
NewInt80h:
xchg esp,edx
cmp edx,0x10000-6
jnz IsStack16Bit
