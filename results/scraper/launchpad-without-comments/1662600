error while building from source on Ubuntu 16.04

I'm trying to build Qemu from source (from git) as specified here: http://www.qemu-project.org/download/#source

Here is the git commit hash for the source: 7d2c6c95511e42dffe2b263275e09957723d0ff4

During the 'make' step, I get the following error:

migration/rdma.c: In function ‘qemu_rdma_dump_id’:
migration/rdma.c:749:21: error: ‘struct ibv_port_attr’ has no member named ‘link_layer’

I searched around a bit, my problem seems related to this: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/992952/

That issue makes me think my libibverbs may be out of date, but I checked and I have libibverbs-dev installed.  Is that the correct version?

FYI, I installed libibverbs-dev as suggested here: http://wiki.qemu-project.org/index.php/Hosts/Linux#Recommended_additional_packages
