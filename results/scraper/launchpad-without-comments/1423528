 setting unsupported timeout for i6300esb watchdog causes hw reset

Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=778291
Version: 2.1

systemd utilizes existing watchdog hardware and set's a 10min timer on reboot.
The i6300esb under qemu doesn't like such a timeout, and immediately resets the hardware:

The last message one gets is
[    9.402243] i6300esb: Unexpected close, not stopping watchdog!


The linked bug report contains information how this bug can easily be reproduced.
With any image using a recent enough systemd as PID 1 you should be able to reproduce it by running

qemu-system-x86_64 -curses -enable-kvm -device i6300esb -watchdog-action reset -hda <image with systemd>


I'm uncertain if this is a qemu or kernel/driver bug. If the latter, please re-assign the bug as necessary.
