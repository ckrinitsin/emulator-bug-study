SLIRP SMB silently fails with MacOS smbd

When using the -net user,id=net0,ipv6=off,smb=/path/to/share/option,hostfwd=tcp::19500-:22 I can successfully mount_smbfs the shared directory on the guest when QEMU is running on a Linux or FreeBSD host. However, on a MacOS host the mount_smbfs command just fails with
`mount_smbfs: unable to open connection: syserr = Connection reset by peer`.
After some debugging it turns out this is because the smbd shipped by macos is incompatible and doesn't use the same config file/command line arguments.

I have since got it working by compiling the sources form samba.org and using the --smbd= configure option pointing to that binary.

Would it be possible to print a warning message or even better abort the launch saying smbd is incompatible with QEMU if the -smb= flag is passed? It appears that smbd should die with an error code on invalid arguments so QEMU should be able to report that.


This was happening with QEMU built from git sources at c1c2a435905ae76b159c573b0c0d6f095b45ebc6.
