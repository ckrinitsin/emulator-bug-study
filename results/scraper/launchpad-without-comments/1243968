VMware ESXi on QEmu Kernel Panic

I attempted to install ESXi 5.5 (the free version) into a QEmu 1.6.1 VM. The guest OS does have the svm capabilities, but it appears VMware is trying to do some kind of hypercall that crashes the guest.

There is more information here: https://communities.vmware.com/message/2297382

It seems to me that this stubbed feature should just be disabled if it is unusable. Or at the very least I should be able to disable it at run-time with a command-line argument.

Is there some way to disable all the hypervisor features that makes it very obvious to a guest os that it is running inside a VM? It would be great if I could install a software and it would actually work (even if it's slow with those features disabled).

FYI, my guest OS capabilities are:
