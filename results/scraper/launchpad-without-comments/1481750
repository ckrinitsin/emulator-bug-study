qemu-system-ppc hangs when running  -M ppce500 -bios u-boot.e500

On recent qemu versions (tested on locally built versions 2.3.50 and 2.3.93)
the command below causes qemu to hang before the u-boot command prompt is reached.
However in an older version (2.2.1) the u-boot bootprompt is reached and can be typed into,
so apparenly something has broken along the way.


ppc-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc -d guest_errors -d in_asm -M ppce500 -nographic -bios pc-bios/u-boot.e500


From the -d in_asm argument you can compare the runs and the 2.2.1 version
outputs a lot more.

------
- I use the unmodified u-boot.e500 that is inlcuded with each respective version.
- when building qemu my configure paramters were in all three cases :
'./configure' '--target-list=ppc-softmmu,arm-softmmu' '--audio-drv-list=' '--enable-debug'
