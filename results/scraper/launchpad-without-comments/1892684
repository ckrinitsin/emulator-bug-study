curl and wget segfaults when link has redirects

Hello,

I've been using qemu-user-static with aarch64 docker images and faced the problem
using binares from the following release: https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static/releases/tag/v5.0.0-2.

curl and wget fails with segmentation fault when trying to fetch something from the link
that has some redirects.

In order to reproduce you can run the following:

1) Register qemu on x86_64 machine
   docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
2) Run arm64v8 docker image and try to run wget or curl
   docker run --rm -it arm64v8/ubuntu bash
   $ apt update
   $ apt install curl wget
   $ curl -L http://erratique.ch/software/astring/releases/astring-0.8.3.tbz
   $ wget  http://erratique.ch/software/astring/releases/astring-0.8.3.tbz

This error cannot be reproduced with binaries from eariler release https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static/releases/tag/v4.2.0-7.
curl and wget work fine with the given link and don't fail with segfault when using
older qemu-user-static binaries
