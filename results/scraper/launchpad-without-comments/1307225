Running a virtual machine on a Haswell system produces machine check events

I'm running a virtual Windows SBS 2003 installation on a Xeon E3 Haswell system running Gentoo Linux. First, I used Qemu 1.5.3 (the latest stable version on Gentoo). I got a lot of machine check events ("mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check events logged") in dmesg that always looked like (using mcelog):

Hardware event. This is not a software error.

I found this discussion on the vmware community: https://communities.vmware.com/thread/452344

It seems that this is (at least partly) caused by the Qemu machine. I switched to Qemu 1.7.0, the first version to use "pc-i440fx-1.7". With this version, the errors almost disappeared, but from time to time, I still get machine check events. Anyways, they so not seem to affect neither the vm, nor the host.

I created the virtual machine on an older Core 2 Duo machine and ran it for several weeks without a single error message, so I think this is actually some problem with the Haswell architecture. The errors didn't show up until I copied the virtual machine to my new machine.
