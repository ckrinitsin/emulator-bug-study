Documentation cannot be build since commit c70a01e449536c616c85ab820c6fbad7d7e9cf39

I tried to build git -based qemu and when documentation is processed I got this error :

./qemu-options.texi:1526: unknown command `list'
./qemu-options.texi:1526: table requires an argument: the formatter for @item
./qemu-options.texi:1526: warning: @table has text but no @item

Looks like commit c70a01e449536c616c85ab820c6fbad7d7e9cf39 is guilty ?!

Or any modification related to documentation, I think.
