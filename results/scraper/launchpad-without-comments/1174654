qemu-system-x86_64 takes 100% CPU after host machine resumed from suspend to ram

I have Windows XP SP3  inside qemu VM. All works fine in 12.10. But after upgraiding to 13.04 i have to restart the VM each time i resuming my host machine, because qemu process starts to take CPU cycles and OS inside VM is very slow and sluggish. However it's still controllable and could be shutdown by itself.

According to the taskmgr any active process takes 99% CPU. It's not stucked on some single process.
