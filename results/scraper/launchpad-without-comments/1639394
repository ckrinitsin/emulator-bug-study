Unable to boot Solaris 8/9 x86 under Fedora 24

Try several ways without success, I think it was a regression because problem seems to be related with ide fixed on 0.6.0:
- int13 CDROM BIOS fix (aka Solaris x86 install CD fix)
- int15, ah=86 BIOS fix (aka Solaris x86 hardware probe hang up fix)

Solaris 10/11 works without a problem, also booting with "scsi" will circumvent initial problem, but later found problems related with "scsi" cdrom boot and also will not found the "ide" disk device.
