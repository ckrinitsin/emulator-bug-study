default nic device created even though supplied by configfile

QEMU emulator version 4.1.94

Documentation states that qemu will create a default nic as long as not explicitly forbidden (-nic none) or defined ( e.g. -nic <options>).

Observation:
Even though qemu-system-ppc is started with "-readconfig" (which defines a nic), another nic gets created. When additionally suppling "-nic none", only the nic of the config file is created.
As matter of fact, if all items that are defined in config file are supplied as command line arguments, no further nic is created. 

Expectation:
When a nic is defined in config file, the default guest-nic should not get created.
That would match behavior when all items, defined in config file are supplied as command line arguments.


Attached config file.
