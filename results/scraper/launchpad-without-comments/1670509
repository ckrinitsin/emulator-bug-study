sgabios outputs incorrect video modes

When run with a bootstrap loader that uses int 0x10 with 0x1301 in %ax, incorrect video modes are output to the serial port.  I believe the VGA image will be correct.  This might also affect the returned values for some interrupts.

This is caused because the set_cursor_position routine fails to save and restore %bx.

I'm working on a fix for this.
