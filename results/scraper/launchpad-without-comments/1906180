Keyboard keys get stuck

Keyboard keys get "stuck" quite often, on certain Linux guests at least, and start repeating themselves until another key is pressed. This is especially noticeable with key combinations like Ctrl+V for pasting. When it happens, you get the pasted text and vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv...

This bug has been present for quite some time but I don't remember any specific version that had it first.


QEMU version: 5.1.0
Guest: Debian stable 64-bit (live), with Gnome desktop (may occur with other Linux guests too)
Host: Arch Linux with KDE desktop (X11, wayland not tested); both default and hardened kernel tested

QEMU start command:
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 6G -cpu host -smp 3 -cdrom debian.iso -boot d -vga std
