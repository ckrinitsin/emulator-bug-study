QEMU epoll for i386-linux-user on arm host is broken in 2.6

I'm trying to get wine running on qemu-i386 on arm.

I found that 2.5.1 is OK, but 2.6 is not.

By bisecting, I found commit 928bed6a057cedd6110e634865e021a24029785a is the problem.

I reverted this commit, and then epoll is OK now.

It seems that the commit broke epoll of qemu-i386 on arm.
