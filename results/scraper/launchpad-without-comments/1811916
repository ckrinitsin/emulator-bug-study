SDL2 interface didn't follow the current X11 keyboard layout for hotkeys

My X11 was configured to use Dvorak keyboard layout, with setxkbmap(1). Despite the window title said 'Press Ctrl-Alt-G to exit grab' after it grabbed the mouse, pressing this hotkey don't have any effects, and I has to switch to a virtual terminal to kill(1) that qemu process. By debugging the program I found it is using the raw key code to handle the key events, so I must use CTRL-ALT-I to exit the grab, in my keyboard.
