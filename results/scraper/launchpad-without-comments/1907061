qemu-system-x86_64 minimizing window causes keyboard input lag globally

After qemu window is minimized, it causes keyboard lag on the host for all applications, pressed keys will be delayed and very laggy, typing to notepad or any other text extremely slowly appear on the screen, queue is slowly processed.
If qemu window is open back to normal size, keyboard is back to normal, everything is back to normal and stable, this behavior i have been testing since several months of qemu releases, i am reporting a bit late here, not breaking but it seems important and everytime i accidently minimize qemu, i remember it later and take qemu window to normal size back always, i try never minimize it anymore.
This problem does not occur if using -display none
Guest OS doesn't matter for this behavior, result is always same
I am using:
qemu 5.1.0.0
qemu-system-x86_64w.exe
Windows 10 build 2004
4K screen dpi scaling set to 150%

If requested, i can record a video to see the problem clearly, but i think all information i give already clear now.

Thanks for making quality software, hope all bugs fixed
