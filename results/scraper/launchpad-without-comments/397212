Scrolling artifacts on some guests

Screen doesn't refresh properly when scrolling (see the attachment).

The behavior is seen on RHEL 4.8 and SLES 11, but not on RHEL 5.3.  However, on RHEL5.3, scrolling is very sluggish.  It seems to be a trade-off between quick movement and frequent / accurate refreshing.

Command line:

qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -drive file=/scratch/images/SLES-11-GMC-x86_64.raw -net nic,vlan=0,macaddr=DE:AD:BE:EF:88:95,model=rtl8139 -net tap -vnc :40 -boot cd -monitor stdio -smp 4
