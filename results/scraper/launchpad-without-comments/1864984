"nr_entries is too big" when using virgl

I have a bootable image where GNOME Shell fails because it hits a limit in virtio-gpu.

In `hw/display/virtio-gpu.c`, there is a limit for `nr_entries` at 16384. There is no explanation for that limit. But there does not seem to be any limit on the kernel side.

Raising this limit with a patch to 262144 solves the issue.

Could there be an explanation why this limit is needed? And why this value? Or could this limit be just removed?
