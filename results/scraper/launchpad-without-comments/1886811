systemd in armhf and armel (both little endian 32-bit) containers fail to start with
Failed to enqueue loopback interface start request: Operation not supported

How to reproduce on Debian (and probably Ubuntu):
mmdebstrap --components="main contrib non-free" --architectures=armhf --variant=important bullseye /var/lib/machines/armhf-bullseye
systemd-nspawn -D /var/lib/machines/armhf-bullseye -b

When "armhf" architecture is replaced with "mips" (32-bit big endian) or "ppc64"
(64-bit big endian), the container starts up fine.

The same symptom is also observed with "powerpc" (32-bit big endian) architecture.
