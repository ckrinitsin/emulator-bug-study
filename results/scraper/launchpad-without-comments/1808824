Mouse leaves VM window when Grab on Hover isn't selected Windows 10 and Intel HAX

On Windows 10.0.17134 I have been having the problem that the mouse will leave the VM window after a short time when grab on hover isn't selected.  The VM will then try to grab on Hover and the mouse will grab in weird places and it will become very unwieldy to control the mouse in the VM window.

This is exasperated by super slow response making it nearly unusable  if the Intel® Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (Intel® HAXM) is not currently installed on my machine.

I know they are different things but they compounded on each other when you have a mouse that is not staying in the VM window and the VM's visualized cpu is acting VERY slow the system is unusable.
