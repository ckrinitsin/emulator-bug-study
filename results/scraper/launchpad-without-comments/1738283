'Less than' (<), 'more than' (>), and 'pipe' (|) can't be typed via VNC

If I start QEMU 2.11 (from https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Virtualization/qemu) VM with VNC, I am unable to type following three characters: 'less than' (<), 'more than' (>), and 'pipe' (|) on en_US QWERTY keyboard. Other characters work fine. QEMu version 2.10.1 worked fine.

/usr/bin/qemu-kvm -m 2048 -cpu kvm64 -drive media=cdrom,if=none,id=cd0,format=raw,file=OI-hipster-minimal-20171031.iso -device ide-cd,drive=cd0 -boot once=d,menu=on,splash-time=5000 -device usb-ehci -device usb-tablet -smp 1 -enable-kvm -vnc :91,share=force-shared

The ISO can be downloaded here: https://www.openindiana.org/download/

Also tried Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-25-1.3.iso and it's the same situation.

If I run the same command without '-vnc :91,share=force-shared', everything works just fine.
