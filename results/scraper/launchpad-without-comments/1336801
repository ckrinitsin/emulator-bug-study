12.04 guest hangs on a 14.04 host  server with cirrus graphics

A new 12.04.4 server guest installation hangs on a 14.04 server host machine.

I did the following:

Created a new Virtual Machine with the Ubuntu 12.04 template using virt-manager
Ran through the installation without a hitch to install a LAMP+SSH server. All standard options apart from that.
On reboot the 12.04 guest started but then hung after doing fsck step.
Trying different options (change disk driver, etc) made it progress a couple more steps but still hung.

The thing that fixed it in the end was to switch to a VGA display driver, away from the default.
