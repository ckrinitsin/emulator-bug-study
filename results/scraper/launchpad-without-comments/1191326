QNX 4 doesn't boot on qemu >= 1.3 


I am using virtual machine with QNX4 operating system installed on it.  I updated my qemu from version
to newer and QNX4 doesn't start any more. All is ok on version 1.2 but when I try to use any newer version 
(1.3, 1.4, 1.5)  QNX4 doesn't boot.  I tried on windows and linux ubuntu hosts - effects are the same.

When virtual machine boots qnx bootloader loads and starts operating system. In the next step
qnx starts its ide driver, which detects qemu harddisk and cdrom. Problem starts when operating system
tries mount partition - an error occur and qnx stop booting procedure:

mount -p "No bios signature in partition sector on /dev/hd0"

I have tried install qnx from cdrom but it seems that there is the same problem. QNX installer boot from
cdrom, detects hard disk and cdrom, but cdrom can't be mounted in the next step of installation procedure.
