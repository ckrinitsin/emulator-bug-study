qemu windows guest issues

Ive noticed the following in the latest qemu build on mingw 64bit for windows

older guests like windows 9* no longer boot they mostly just bsod its been this way for ages same with 32bit builds
xp 64bit and other 64bit windows guests no longer work and havent for ages same with 32bit builds 
xp 32bit guest doesent work under 64bit builds but they work on 32bit builds

are the issues with the coroutine stuff on windows builds being worked on? id gladly test patches

just a few observations is all :)
