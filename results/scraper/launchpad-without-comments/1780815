SDL Doesn't Rescale Image on Resolution Change

Whilst in fullscreen mode, if the guest changes resolution for whatever reason, the screen doesn't update the scaling so you end up looking at only part of the screen, e.g. if the guest changes from 640x480 to 1024x768, the image will still be fullscreen, but what you're actually looking at will be the top-left most 640x480 segment of the screen stretched out.

Manually going out of fullscreen mode and then back in fixes the scaling, but you have to do that every time the guest changes resolution.
