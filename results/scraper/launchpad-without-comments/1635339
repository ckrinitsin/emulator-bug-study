qxl_pre_save assertion failure on vm "save"

When I try and save my Windows 10 VM, I see an assertion failure, and the machine is shut down.

I see the following in the log:

main_channel_handle_parsed: agent start
qemu-system-x86_64: /build/qemu-Zwynhi/qemu-2.5+dfsg/hw/display/qxl.c:2101: qxl_pre_save: Assertion `d->last_release_offset < d->vga.vram_size' failed.
2016-10-20 11:52:42.713+0000: shutting down

Please let me know what other information would be relevant!
