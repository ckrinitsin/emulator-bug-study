qemu-system-x86_64 version 2.5.0 freezes during windows 7 installation in lubuntu 16.04

Hi!

I have been using qemu - kvm for several years in different versions of ubuntu (lubuntu). I am trying to migrate from 15.04 to 16.04 and am having a problem. In particular, on my machine (a samsung series 9 with dual core i7 processor and 8gb ram) the following commands worked in 15.04 but do not work in 15.10 and 16.04. FYI, I tested them on a clean machine, where I have created a 60GB image file in its own partition.. In particular, I am using the command to start installing windows 7 and it works in a clean install of 15.04 (yesterday) but not in 15.10 (yesterday) or 16.04 (the day before). I do not get any error messages in my xterminal when running this and do not know how to check for windows error messages. By not working I mean that after loading files it gets to a windows screen and then stays there forever.

The command lines used to invoke qemu is:
echo "*** Installing windows 7 virtual machine - Step 2"


echo "*** Try command for slow mouse"
export SDL_VIDEO_X11_DGAMOUSE=0
