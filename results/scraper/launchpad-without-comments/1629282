QEMU (still) hangs on Windows 7 install

I'm trying to install Windows 7 as guest, but the machine still hangs (more precisely, the windows icon keeps flashing, but never goes past this stage).

I think this is a different bug from https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1581936.

Specifically, its happens when the OVMF BIOS is used, and I can't find any workaround (in the above bug, by changing the display, the installation doesn't hang).

The most minimal commandline that reproduces the issue is (generic format):

$QEMU_BINARY \
  -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly,file=$QEMU_BIOS \
  -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=$QEMU_BIOS_TMP \
  -enable-kvm \
  -m $QEMU_MEMORY \
  -display std \
  -cpu host,kvm=off -smp 4,sockets=1,cores=4 \
  -cdrom $QEMU_WINDOWS_7_CD \
;

I'm using `OVMF_15214.fd` as BIOS.
