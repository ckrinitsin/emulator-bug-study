Getting "qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault)" when the installing "libc-bin" which "wget" depends on.

the QEMU release version where the bug was found.

apt list --installed | grep qemu
qemu-user-static/focal-updates,focal-security,now 1:4.2-3ubuntu6.14 amd64 [installed]


The installing "libc-bin" which "wget" depends on crashes as below when we execute docker image of Debian GNU/Linux bullseye for ARM64 on Ubuntu 20.04 for AMD64.
This problem also occurs on CI(GitHub Actions)(https://github.com/groonga/groonga/runs/2338497272?check_suite_focus=true#step:11:127).
Probably, The cause of this crash is https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1749393.
This bug has already been fixed in qemu-user-static pacakge for Ubuntu 20.10.

However, this fix is not included in qemu-user-static pacakge for Ubuntu 20.04.
Currently, GitHub Actions does not support Ubuntu 20.10.
Therefore, this problem is still happening in CI.

Would it be possible for you to backport this fix into Ubuntu 20.04?


How to reproduce:

sudo apt install -y qemu-user-static docker.io
sudo docker run --rm arm64v8/debian:bullseye bash -c 'apt update && apt install -y wget'
