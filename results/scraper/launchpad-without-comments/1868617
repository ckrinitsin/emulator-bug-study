multiseat: route different spice tablet events to distinct vdagents

I'm not sure exactly what "can't figure it" means, but it looks to me like qemu can't route incoming tablet events from a spice client to distinct vdagent channels.

I think this part of the process can be fixed within qemu.  I've reported https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/issues/121 to address the issues with the keyboard interface at the protocol level.
