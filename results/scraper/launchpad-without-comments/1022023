vga/std lacks few wide screen modes.

hi,
i have noticed that qemu-1.0.1 doesn't support few widescreen modes on -vga std, e.g. 1680x1050, 1600x1000, 1440x900.
i have a few laptops with kvm and i would like to work with qemu windows guest native full wide screen mode.
could you please add these modes?
