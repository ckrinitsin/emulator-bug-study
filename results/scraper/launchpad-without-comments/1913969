unable to migrate non shared storage when TLS is used

Operating system: Gentoo
Architecture: x86_64
kernel version: 5.4.72, 5.10.11
libvirt version: at least 6.9.0, 6.10.0, 7.0.0
Hypervisor and version: qemu 5.1.0, 5.2.0

With software versions described above and following configurations:
libvirt:
key_file = "/etc/ssl/libvirt/server.lan.key"
cert_file = "/etc/ssl/libvirt/server.lan.crt"
ca_file = "/etc/ssl/libvirt/ca.crt"
log_filters="3:remote 4:event 3:util.json 3:rpc 1:*"
log_outputs="1:file:/var/log/libvirt/libvirtd.log"
qemu:
default_tls_x509_cert_dir = "/etc/ssl/qemu"
default_tls_x509_verify = 1
migration with tls:
virsh # migrate vm1 qemu+tls://server2.lan/system --persistent --undefinesource --copy-storage-all --verbose --tls
never succeeds. Progress stops typically at high progress amounts (95%-98%), and network traffic drastically drops as well (from 1 gbps+ to nothing). domjobinfo progress also stops. Without --tls migrations succeed without issues without any other changes to hosts or configurations.

Note: I reported this originally as libvirt bug: https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/issues/108.
