qemu should close sound device when no more needs.

I use alsa directly or via pulseaudio on qemu.
And I use xmms2 as well as qemu.

When I use alsa, one of xmms2 or qemu can play sound.
When I use pulseaudio with qemu and pulseaudio -k, and pulseaudio --start,
qemu can't play sound.

I think that:
- qemu should open sound device when needs.
- qemu should close sound device when no more needs.

One of xmms2 or qemu can play sound, but both of them rarely play sound
at the same time.
qemu occurs error on pulseaudio -k, but once close and open the device,
the error will be recovered, I hope.
