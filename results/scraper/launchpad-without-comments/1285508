[ppa 2.0~git-20140225] mouse cursor invisible with Ubuntu live system

As requested on u-devel@, I tested QEMU 2.0~git-20140225.aa0d1f4-0ubuntu2 from ppa:ubuntu-virt/candidate. This has a regression with the mouse cursor.

I downloaded the current Ubuntu Desktop trusty beta-1 amd64 image, and booted it in QEMU:

  $ kvm -m 2048 -cdrom trusty-desktop-amd64.iso

This boots fine, but in the desktop I don't see any mouse cursor.
