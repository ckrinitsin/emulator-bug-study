Mouse works badly when connecting to host via vnc

Let's assume we have some physical host A. This host runs qemu guest B locally without any options like "-vnc" etc.
Then I connect from some physical host C to the host A via VNC or Teamviewer ( www.teamviewer.com ). And then I try to remote control (via this vnc connection) qemu guest. But I cannot do this because my mouse disappears when I click at my qemu guest. I see little black square only. (This square is vnc feature, it automatically appears when mouse disappears.) When I click to some objects inside guest I will instead click to another random object inside guest.

I saw this bug in the following configurations:
* A: Debian squeeze 64-bit, Teamviewer 8, Qemu 0.12.5, C: Ubuntu precise 64-bit, Teamviewer 8, B: Windows 7 32-bit, command line:
qemu-system-x86_64 --enable-kvm -m 2048  -daemonize -localtime -drive cache=none,file=/root/vm/w7-sp1-i386-en.cow
* A: Debian squeeze 64-bit, Teamviewer 8, Qemu 0.12.5, C: Ubuntu precise 64-bit, Teamviewer 8, B: Debian squeeze 64-bit, command line:
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 256 -daemonize -snapshot -net none -drive cache=none,file=/dev/sda
* A: Debian squeeze 64-bit, x11vnc 0.9.10, Qemu 0.12.5, C: Ubuntu precise 64-bit, xvnc4viewer 4.1.1, B: Windows 7 32-bit, command line:
qemu-system-x86_64 --enable-kvm -m 2048  -daemonize -localtime -drive cache=none,file=/root/vm/w7-sp1-i386-en.cow

Also, if I add "-usbdevice tablet" option, this bug will disappear. So, probably, this bug is not a bug. But in this case you should document it. I. e. you should add to docs something like "add -usbdevice tablet if you remote control qemu host".

Also, if I use "-vnc" option (in the text above I didn't use it!) my mouse doesn't work as expected, too. The pointers don't line up, i. e. are not synced. But if I add "-usbdevice tablet" option, mouse will work. As far as I know this is not a bug. But then document it, too. Qemu's man page already says "It is very useful to enable the usb tablet device when using this option (option -usbdevice tablet)" in qemu 0.12.5. But I think this is not enough. The man page should say: "You should add -usbdevice tablet option and your guest OS should support tablet device or your mouse will not work".
