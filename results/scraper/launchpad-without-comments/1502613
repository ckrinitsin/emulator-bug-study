[Feature Request] Battery Status / Virtual Battery

When using virtualization on notebooks heavily then virtual machines do not realize that they're running on a notebook device causing high power consumption because they're not switching into a optimized "laptop mode". This leads to the circumstance that they are trying to do things like defragmentation / virtus scan / etc. while the host is still running on batteries.
