Cirrus video, graphical corruption, bad fonts

The error
===

I started qemu by

`shell
$ ./qemu-system-i386 -serial stdio -cdrom /dev/cdrom -vga cirrus
S1111111111S1111111111S1111111111S1111111111â–’*n*n*n*n
`

with the original suse7.0 cd 1 in the cdrom drive (I think https://archive.org/details/suse-7.0_release_i386 has the image). After some console output (that uses a vga framebuffer which seems to work fine) the suse installer is started. It is displayed mostly correct, but several text passages are completely garbled.

I noticed the same type of corruption when trying to run an old XF86 SVGA Server on a SuSE 6.2 System using the `-vga cirrus` option.

Therefore I think that the cirrus emulation might not work as intended any more.

Qemu version
===

I used  qemu-w64-setup-20180815.exe provided by https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/

./qemu-system-i386 -version
QEMU emulator version 3.0.0 (v3.0.0-11723-ge2ddcc5879-dirty)

Hope you can fix it. 

Best regards!
