qemu-user clone syscall fails

qemu-user fails to emulate clone() (https://linux.die.net/man/2/clone).  The architecture doesn't seem to matter, tho I've mostly been testing aarch64.

Attached is clone_test.c that demonstrates the problem.  Running it natively looks like this:
$ bin/clone_test
The variable was 9
clone returned 4177: 0 Success
The variable is now 42


However, running it via qemu looks like:
$ qemu-aarch64-static --version
qemu-aarch64 version 5.2.0 (v5.2.0)

$ qemu-aarch64-static ./clone_test
The variable was 9
clone returned -1: 22 Invalid argument
The variable is now 9
