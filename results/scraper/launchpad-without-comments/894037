With VNC, "-usbdevice tablet" no longer makes mouse pointers line up

I use qemu in VNC mode.  In order to get the client and server mouse pointers to line up, I've had to use the "-usbdevice tablet" option.  This no longer works, and it behaves the same as if the option is not there.  This makes my VMs unusable to me.

Here's how I'm booting WinXP:

qemu-system-x86_64 -vga std -drive cache=writeback,index=0,media=disk,file=winxp.img -k en-us -m 2048 -smp 2 -vnc :3101 -usbdevice tablet -boot c -enable-kvm &

The Windows install hasn't changed, only qemu.

I'm running this version of QEMU:

QEMU emulator version 0.15.0 (qemu-kvm-0.15.0), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

I'll see about upgrading to 0.15.1, but since I haven't seen other reports of this particular problem in your DB, I'm assuming that this problem has not been fixed between 0.15.0 and 0.15.1.
