PowerPC altivec rounding instructions vrfi(m|n|z)not correctly mapped

When using ppc-linux-user/qemu-ppc on a ppc ELF executable, I see that QEMU wrongly recognizes the vrfim, vrfin and vrfiz instructions:

If the binary contains vrfim QEMU sees vrfiz
If the binary contains vrfin QEMU sees vrfim
If the binary contains vrfiz QEMU sees vrfin
The vrfip instruction is correctly recognized.

Those instructions normally round a floating-point altivec vector to zero (z), infinity (p), minus infinity (m) or nearest (n).
