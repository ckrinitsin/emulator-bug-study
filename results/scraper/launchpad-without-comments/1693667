-cpu haswell / broadwell have no MONITOR in features1

In qemu 2.9.0 if you run

    qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu Broadwell (or Haswell)

then the CPU features1 flag include the SSE3 bit, but do NOT include the MONITOR/MWAIT bit.  This is so even when the host includes the features.


Additionally, running qemu in this manner results in several error messages:

(Among possible other uses, the lack of the MONITOR feature bit causes NetBSD to fall-back on a
check-and-pause loop while an application CPU is waiting to be told to proceed by the boot CPU.)
