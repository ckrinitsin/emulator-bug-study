HAX on Windows, memory lease error

Today I tried to use QEMU on Windows 8.1 x64 with Intel HAX.

Command line: qemu-system-x86_64.exe -accel hax -m 8000 -hda /opt/disk/ubuntu.img -cdrom /opt/iso/ubuntu-17.04-server-amd64.iso

Host machine has 32Gb physical memory, I got error:

HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virt mode.
**
ERROR:A:/msys64/home/admin/git/qemu/target/i386/hax-mem.c:210:hax_process_section: assertion failed: (size <= UINT32_MAX)

When using -m 4000 (and below) everything is fine. But if I try use >4000 and <8000 I get crash with errors:

HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virt mode.
