udp checksum computed as 0 not converted to 0xffff, from guest os that share a common linux bridge among multiple guest os

UDP checksum computed as '0' during transmission of packets that uses e1000 NIC in the Guest as well as emulated h/w in the qemu layer, That needs to be converted to 0xffff, This occurs only when Hardware checksum offload is been set in the guest OS NIC and made it as a transmitter. The guest O.S use the N/W interface that is been shared to the linux brige created in the host (used source=<bridge>) in the xml tags of libvirt.

As per RFC768(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768 [^]), If the computed checksum is zero, it is transmitted as all ones (the equivalent in one's complement arithmetic). An all zero transmitted checksum value means that the transmitter generated no checksum (for debugging or for higher level protocols that don't care).
