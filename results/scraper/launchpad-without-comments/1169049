do not stop on first gdb breakpoint with -enable-kvm

I run qemu like this:
  qemu-system-x86-64 -enable-kvm -hda <path to file> -s -S,

and start gdb with commands like this:
  gdb>tartget remote localhost:1234
  gdb>break *0x7c00
  gdb>c

but gdb don't stop on it. I then could break execution manually and then breakpoints work.

QEMU version: 1.4.0 (from Debian repos)
GDB version: 7.5.1 (copiled from sources, but previous was 7.4.1 from Debian repo)

PS Same problem occure on Ubuntu 13.04 with same Qemu and Gdb 7.5.0 from repo.

Thank you
