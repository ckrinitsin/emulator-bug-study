It's not possible to start a VM with a network cable unplugged

There should be a command line (sub)option to unplug a network cable.
While from the monitor interface I can issue:

set_link virtio-net-pci.0 off

There's no way to fire a VM from command line with that cable already unplugged.
As an example, virtualbox can do it.
