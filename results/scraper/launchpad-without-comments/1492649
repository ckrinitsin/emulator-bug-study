QEMU soundhw HDA huge microphone lag

I use a Windows 7 x86_64 guest with VGA passthrough and -soundhw hda. The audio plays fine, but the microphone input is delayed by more than 20 seconds.

-soundhw ac97 does not have this delay but it has choppy sound playback and input.

Arch linux
Kernel: 4.1.6-1-ARCH
Audio hardware: 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801JI (ICH10 Family) HD Audio Controller
