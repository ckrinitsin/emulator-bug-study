Regressions on arm-linux-gnueabihf target with some GCC tests

Hi,

After trying qemu master:
commit 474f3938d79ab36b9231c9ad3b5a9314c2aeacde
Merge: 68d7ff0 14f5d87
Author: Peter Maydell <email address hidden>
Date: Fri Jun 21 15:40:50 2019 +0100

even with the fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1834496,
I've noticed several regressions compared to qemu-3.1 when running the GCC testsuite.
I'm attaching a tarball containing several GCC tests (binaries), needed shared libs, and a short script to run all the tests.

All tests used to pass w/o error, but with a recent qemu, all of them make qemu crash.

This was noticed with GCC master configured with
--target arm-none-linux-gnueabihf
--with-cpu cortex-a57
--with-fpu crypto-neon-fp-armv8

Thanks
