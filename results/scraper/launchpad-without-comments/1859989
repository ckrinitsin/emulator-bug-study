qemu-img has broken output with large snapshot names

On Qemu 4.1.1 the output of snalshots breaks if the chosen state name is too long:

# qemu-img snapshot -l /mnt/local/some_image.qcow2
Snapshot list:
ID        TAG                 VM SIZE                DATE       VM CLOCK
1         online_provider_with_dhcp747 MiB 2020-01-15 12:05:01   00:00:45.873

Prior to 4.1.1 this used to work with extra tabs for the VM SIZE values. The collision is also disabling us from using a regex on top of this input to detect the snapshot.
