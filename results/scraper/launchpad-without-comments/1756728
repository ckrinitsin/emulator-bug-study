virtio-scsi virtio-scsi-single and virtio-blk on raw image, games are not starting

Using virtio-scsi / vitro-scsi-sing and vitro-blk on a ZFS/raw image, most Assassin's Creed (Origin especially) games are not starting (uPlay), it seems related to some check or commands applications are doing on the disk drive that fails to respond.

Workaround has been found by creating a VHD volume, mounting it and installing games on it.

On a side note, application like HDDScan, CrystalDiskInfo returns nothing regarding disk drives.
