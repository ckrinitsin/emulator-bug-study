"Image format was not specified" warning should be suppressed for the vvfat (and probably nbd) driver

Running

qemu -drive file.driver=vvfat,file.dir=.

displays

WARNING: Image format was not specified for 'json:{"dir": ".", "driver": "vvfat"}' and probing guessed raw.
         Automatically detecting the format is dangerous for raw images, write operations on block 0 will be restricted.
         Specify the 'raw' format explicitly to remove the restrictions.

However, since "images" provided by the vvfat driver are always raw (and the first sector isn't writeable in any case), this warning is superfluous and should not be displayed.

A similar warning is displayed for NBD devices; I suspect it should be also disabled for similar reasons, but I'm not sure if serving non-raw images is actually a violation of the protocol. qemu-nbd translates them to raw images, for what it's worth, even if it may be suppressed with -f raw.

Noticed on 2.3.0; the code that causes this behaviour is still apparently present in today's git master (f3a1b5068cea303a55e2a21a97e66d057eaae638). Speaking of versions: you may want to update the copyright notice that qemu -version displays.
