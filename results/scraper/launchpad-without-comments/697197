Empty password allows access to VNC in libvirt

The help in the /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf states

"To allow access without passwords, leave this commented out. An empty
string will still enable passwords, but be rejected by QEMU
effectively preventing any use of VNC."

yet setting:

vnc_password=""

allows access to the vnc console without any password prompt just as if it is hashed out completely.
