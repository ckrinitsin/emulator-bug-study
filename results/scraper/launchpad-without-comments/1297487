MTU not honored in virtio vnet

I am observing a potential regression/different behavior between rel. 14.04 (dev branch) and release 13.04.

My hardware is: Cisco UCS blade B200-M3 and the network adapter card: Cisco UCS VIC 1240.

lsb_release -rd
Description:	Ubuntu Trusty Tahr (development branch)
Release:	14.04

uname -a
Linux konan2 3.13.0-19-generic #40-Ubuntu SMP Mon Mar 24 02:36:06 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

The problem:
After starting a kvm with virtio interfaces I am passing HTTP traffic via an external network traffic simulator.
The tool is sending a TCP packet of 3481B, because the tool MTU is set to 1400B, it splits the packets into 3 TCP segments.
When the 3 segments are received at the host eth1 interface, the host (ubuntu 14.04) reassembles the TCP packets into a larger packet (GRO), then passes the packet up on vnet1. At this point, because vnet1 MTU is 1500B, it is supposed to re-segment the packet and pass the 3 segments up to the VM. But it passes the big 3481B packet instead.

This behavior did not happen when I tried the same scenario in release 13.04

I can disable this behavior by disabling TSO (TCP segment offloading in the vnet), but I did not have to do this in rel. 13.04 and I feel the MTU is not honored as it should be with rel. 14.04.

 ip link show | grep eth1
3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq master br1 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
 ip link show | grep vnet1
16: vnet1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast master br1 state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 500

I am attaching two tcpdump/pcap traces that show a TCP transaction passing on vnet1 when TSO is on and when TSO is off.

Please see:

- vnet1_tso_off.pcap

in attachment.

I noticed there was a driver upgrade in rel. 14.04:
