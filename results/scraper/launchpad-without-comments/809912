qemu-kvm -m bigger 4096 aborts with 'Bad ram offset'

When I try to start a virtual machine (x86_64 guest on a x86_64 host that has 32GB memory, using kvm_amd module, both host and guest running linux-2.6.39 kernels) with "qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu host -smp 2 -m 4096 ...", shortly after the guest kernel starts, qemu aborts with a message "Bad ram offset 11811c000".

With e.g. "-m 3500" (or lower), the virtual machine runs fine.

I experience this both using qemu-kvm 0.14.1 and a recent version from git
