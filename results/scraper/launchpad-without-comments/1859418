disk driver with iothread setting hangs live migrations

Per report raised at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1790093

Description of problem:

A disk driver definition using iothread parameter causes live migration with copy storage to hang during or just before the final ram sync stage.

Interestingly, having the scsi controller as a separate iothread does not trigger the issue.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

I can reproduce this on centos7 with qemu-ev and with centos 8:

qemu-kvm-ev-2.12.0-33.1.el7_7.4.x86_64
qemu-kvm-2.12.0-65.module_el8.0.0+189+f9babebb.5.x86_64

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a definition with 1 iothread on the disk image:

      <driver name='qemu' type='qcow2' iothread='1' />

2. Issue a live migrate request like: virsh migrate --live --copy-storage-all vm qemu+tcp://remote/system
3. Live migrate on source copies storage and then hangs at 80-99%, I guess during the ram copy phase.

Keeping exactly the same config but without the iothread on the disk driver has successful migrations every time.
