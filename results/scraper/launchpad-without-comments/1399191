Large VHDX image size

We are trying to convert a VMDK image to VHDX image for deploy to HyperV Server ( SCVMM 2012 SP1) using qemu-img.
We tried converting the image using both 'fixed' as well as 'dynamic' format. We found that both the disks occupy the same size of 50GB. When the same is done with VHD image, we found that the dynamic disks are much lesser in size (5 GB) than the fixed disk (50GB). 

Why is that the VHDX generates large sized images for both the formats?

The following commands were used to convert the vmdk image to VHDX format

1. qemu-img convert -p -o subformat=fixed  -f vmdk -O vhdx Test.vmdk Test-fixed.vhdx

qemu-img info Test-fixed.vhdx
image: Test-fixed.vhdx
file format: vhdx
virtual size: 50G (53687091200 bytes)
disk size: 50G
cluster_size: 16777216




2. qemu-img convert -p -o subformat=dynamic  -f vmdk -O vhdx Test.vmdk Test-dynamic.vhdx

qemu-img info Test-dynamic.vhdx
image: Test-dynamic.vhdx
file format: vhdx
virtual size: 50G (53687091200 bytes)
disk size: 50G
cluster_size: 16777216


We tried this with the following version of qemu
1. qemu-2.0.0
2. qemu-2.1.2
3. qemu-2.2.0-rc4


Please let us know how to create compact VHDX images using qemu-img.
Thank you
