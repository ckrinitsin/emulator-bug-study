Memory corruption in Windows 10 guest / amd64

I have a Win 10 Pro x64 guest inside a qemu/kvm running on an Arch x86_64 host. The VM has a physical GPU passed through, as well as the physical USB controllers, as well as a dedicated SSD attached via SATA; you can find the complete libvirt xml here: https://pastebin.com/U1ZAXBNg
I built qemu from source using the qemu-minimal-git AUR package; you can find the build script here: https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=qemu-minimal-git (if you aren't familiar with Arch, this is essentially a bash script where build() and package() are run to build the files, and then install them into the $pkgdir to later tar them up.)

Starting with qemu v2.10.0, Windows crashes randomly with a bluescreen about CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION. I also tested the git heads f90ea7ba7c, 861cd431c9 and e822e81e35, before I went back to v2.9.0, which is running stable for over 50 hours right now.

During my tests I found that locking the memory pages alleviates the problem somewhat, but never completely avoids it. However, with the crashes occuring randomly, that could as well be false conclusions; I had crashes within minutes after boot with that too.

I will now start `git bisect`ing; if you have any other suggestions on what I could try or possible patches feel free to leave them with me.
