Q35: Windows BSOD running on 6.1.0
Description of problem:
Starting with QEMU 6.1.0, Windows no longer boots with Q35 (including `pc-q35-6.0` as well). When booting an existing Windows 7 installation, BSOD appears during boot (0x0000007B). If you try to install Windows from an ISO, the follow error appears when you try to start setup.
