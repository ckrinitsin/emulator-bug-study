SVGA/VESA strange colors (NetWare 6.x)
Description of problem:
The text mode part of the installation is correct but whenever the X server is starting, the display seems to be in 16 colors although GUI settings shows "SVGA/256 colors" (NetWare setup reports a "SVGA Plug & Play" display, VESA 2.0 compliance expected). Color depth issue with VESA? Telling NetWare to use explicitly the Cirrus Logic driver for a CL GD 5446 bring the display back to normal and colors are displayed as they should.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Grab a NetWare 6.0 installation ISO on some abandonware site (no need of a license key, unlicensed = 2 users max.)
2. Execute the command line above
3. Complete the text-mode part (defaults choices are fine)
Additional information:
NetWare 6.0 + Qemu => Same issue. SVGA PnP with wrong colors.
NetWare 6.5 + Qemu => Same issue. SVGA PnP with wrong colors.
NetWare 6.0 + PCem/86Box => does not exhibit the issue. Colors are normal.

Using SeaBIOS 1.16.
