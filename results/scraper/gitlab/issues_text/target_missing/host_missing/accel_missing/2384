The full log is attached.[qemu_imx6ul_kernel_panic_info.txt](/uploads/c4075a3de7894c18050bf53c32bb18a7/qemu_imx6ul_kernel_panic_info.txt)
Steps to reproduce:
1. download and build qemu 7.2.11
2. download LF_v6.1.55-2.2.1_images_IMX6UL7D.zip from NXP containing kernel, dtb, rootfs, ...etc binaries 
3. To use diskimage as ‘sd’ card , we need to shrink .wic image we got from NXP to fit in 4GB : 
./qemu-img resize --shrink imx-image-full.wic 4G
4. invoke the command to run qemu described above.
