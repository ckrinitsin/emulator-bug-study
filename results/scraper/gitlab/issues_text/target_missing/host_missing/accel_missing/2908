Display Output Not Sane After Driver Installation
Description of problem:
Using an S3 Diamond Stealth 3000 card through VFIO, after installing an official driver, either from the Windows disc or an updated download, the displayed output from the graphics card is not sane.
Additional information:
Driver: [https://theretroweb.com/expansioncards/s/diamond-stealth-3d-3000-pci#driver](https://theretroweb.com/expansioncards/s/diamond-stealth-3d-3000-pci#driver)

Followed the instructions in the Readme. To install Standard VGA driver first then the Diamond 3000 driver. No change. It is not the only S3 card that I have tried that behaves like this. I have also used the bios rom downloaded directly from the card, again with no change.
