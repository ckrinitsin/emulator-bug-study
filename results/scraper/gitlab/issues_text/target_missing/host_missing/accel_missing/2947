Tablet-like mouse under Linux guest even if no -device usb-tablet is specified
Description of problem:
Arch Linux guest has absolute mouse tracking even when there is `-nodefaults` and no -device usb-tablet is provided. The guest does not have qemu guest agent installed. This is the unwanted behavior. The expected behavior is that it has a separate mouse pointer under guest, like with Windows guest.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install guest operating system
2. Install gnome metapackage and enable GDM
3. Reboot
4. GDM has absolute mouse tracking and the mouse gets captured automatically, without having to click on the window or pressing Ctrl+Alt+G
