Super/Win key seems to release immediately on sdl+windows
Description of problem:
Currently on windows when trying SerenityOS the super key releases immediately so you can't use the shortcuts, with the GTK gui (gl off) it works though. but GTK has other problems with mouse which sometimes doesn't work at all, SDL seems to work well besides from this one issue.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Boot with default settings on wsl2 which launches qemu on windows if it's installed
2. Try to use any of the superkey shortcuts like superkey+space for a search popup https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/dc47d01fdc62a1ee319310e2b11c26b8ebe8899d/Base/usr/share/man/man7/KeyboardShortcuts.md#L4
3. Fail because it immediately opens the menu blocking the shortcuts.
