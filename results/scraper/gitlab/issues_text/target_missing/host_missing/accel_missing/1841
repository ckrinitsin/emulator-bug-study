qemu version with 7.2.5 or earlier than 7.2.5 with nvme disk has  I/O QID 22 timeout, Aborting errors
Description of problem:
When I use the 7.2.5 version of qemu or versions earlier than 7.2.5 to compile and start the virtual machine, the machine has an nvme disk which is SAMSUNG MZQL23T8HCLS-00B7C and passed through by VFIO. When i use fio to perform pressure test on the nvme disk in vm, dmesg shows message like this nvme nvme0: I/O QID 22 timeout, Aborting, the picture below shows its details. Howerver, when i use 8.0.0 version of qemu to compile and start vm, and using fio to perform pressure test on the nvme disk in vm, it does not have the problem like that. I have using different kernel version, however, the probelem persists, so i think this is not a kernel issue, but a qemu problem.


if the irqbalance is running in vm, the problem happens very often, however if the irqbalance is stopped, the problem disappear.
