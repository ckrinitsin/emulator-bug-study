EDID does not reflected to window size when added through the commandline
Description of problem:
It seems some odd behavior on the guest screen. it shows me the size of default window (640x480) instead of override the value to 1740x720. This size (640x480) is first initialized on ui/console.c => QemuConsole *graphic_console_init and I did noticed that in hw/display/virtio-gpu-base.c=> static int virtio_gpu_ui_info the override value is not taking place instead it just took the value from ui/console.c (640x480). May I know, how do I achieved the right override edid value from the current provided interface.

##Additional information
I did noticed that the edid flag is always true (running this command) It is contradiction from the doc.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the qemu with the command mentioned
2. Check the resolution of guest OS
