Cannot boot ArcaOS 5.1.0 (a distro of OS/2 Warp 4.52) in UEFI mode
Description of problem:
ArcaOS has added the UEFI support since 5.1.0, it has been tested on my physical machine(Ryzen 3300X + RTX2060 Super), and VirtualBox with an `Other x64` machine(the new OS/2 bootloader used in UEFI mode is x64 only).

Fixes applied to #2198 are perfectly worked in legacy BIOS mode, but if I tried to boot it in UEFI mode, it will stuck on logo screen, and if I enable verbose mode in boot menu, nothing will be shown on the screen and serial ports.

It happens in both `i440fx` machine type and `q35` machine type.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install latest qemu HEAD version via `brew install qemu --HEAD`
2. Create new virtual disk via `qemu-img create -f qcow2 hdd.img 20G`
3. Copy EFI bios file and var file
   ```
   cp /opt/homebrew/Cellar/qemu/HEAD-1a2d52c/share/qemu/edk2-x86_64-code.fd bios.fd
   cp /opt/homebrew/Cellar/qemu/HEAD-1a2d52c/share/qemu/edk2-i386-vars.fd vars.fd
   ```
4. Launch it
