Additional information:
https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/44f28df24767cf9dca1ddc9b23157737c4cbb645/ui/cursor.c#L112
I think the reason for the problem is that the cursor pointer was not set to NULL when qemu call cursor_put. But I don't know what situation will trigger this error.
This error is difficult to reproduce by natural.
