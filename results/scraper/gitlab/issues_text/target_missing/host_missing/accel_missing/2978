Qemu assertion issue
Description of problem:
This issue is **not caused by my OS**, as it runs perfectly under VMware and other emulators.

However, when using QEMU, the emulator sometimes randomly **crashes or aborts** during boot or early execution. The crash is **inconsistent** â€” sometimes it runs, sometimes it fails immediately.

QEMU fails with an **assertion failure** in `qemu_mutex_lock_iothread_impl`
Steps to reproduce:
Unfortunately, I do not know exactly what causes this issue. It may be specific to my system or configuration.
