macOS 12.x ld: warning: -undefined dynamic_lookup may not work with chained fixups
Description of problem:
Not sure if this is a serious or negligible problem and if it has any significant runtime implications but reporting it anyway:

```
$ ld -v

I saw a similar discussions in Bazel building system, CPython, and Ruby:
- https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16413
- https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97524
- https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/6193
- https://issues.guix.gnu.org/issue/57849
Steps to reproduce:
1. ` ./configure --target-list=aarch64-softmmu,arm-softmmu --enable-cocoa --enable-plugins` (note that target list is not that important in this case though)
2. `ninja -C build`
3. Observe the warnings
Additional information:
See "New Features" subsection under "Linking" section for chained fixup
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-13-release-notes for more information:

> All programs and dylibs built with a deployment target of macOS 12 or iOS 15 or later now use the chained fixups format. This uses different load commands and LINKEDIT data, and wonâ€™t run or load on older OS versions. (49851380)
