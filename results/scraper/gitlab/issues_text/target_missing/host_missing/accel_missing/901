Bad screen behavior with adaptive sync
Description of problem:
KDE Wayland has freesync automatically enabled for full screen applications[[1]](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Variable_refresh_rate#Wayland_configuration). When using a VM in full screen mode, the screen starts having a strange behavior, like "blinking". I've tried windows 10, Linux Mint, MX Linux and Ubuntu 21.10.
The problem disappears if using Xorg or disabling freesync trough KDE settings.
Steps to reproduce:
1. On KDE Wayland, check if freesync is activated in settings> screen> adaptive synchronization 
2. Launch any vm in fuul screen mode
3. Observe the screen
