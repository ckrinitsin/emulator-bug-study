Failed to get write lock on qcow2 image from a sigkilled vm
Additional information:
That feature will solve an issue i have with qemu that i muself created 
by sending a `kill -9` to a qemu VM after it stopped accepting vnc connections.
I can't use the same qcow2 image currently. Maybe a reboot will fix it, but i did 
check `lslocks` and there was no lock on it there.
