Qemu commit 7efd65423a cannot be built: Couldn't find file "symbols/ar" in include paths
Description of problem:
Hello.

I try to build qemu based on commit 7efd65423a but it breaks in step 9035/10108, complaining about a missing "symbols/ar".

The last time I get a full build was with commit fdd0df5340.

Configure options: `--prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --libexecdir=/usr/lib/qemu --smbd=/usr/bin/smbd --enable-modules --enable-sdl --disable-werror`

Here is the error log I got:

```

```

I'll try to do a bisect as soon as possible to see which commit break all.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Just grab commit 7efd65423a
2. Apply these configure options: `--prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --libexecdir=/usr/lib/qemu --smbd=/usr/bin/smbd --enable-modules --enable-sdl --disable-werror`
3. launch make and wait
