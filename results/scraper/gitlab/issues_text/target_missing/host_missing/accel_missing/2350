Incorrect RNG_CTRL and RNG_DATA_OUTPUT register offets for Aspeed AST2600 A3
Description of problem:
hw/misc/aspeed_scu.c has the following lines:

#define AST2600_RNG_CTRL          TO_REG(0x524)
#define AST2600_RNG_DATA          TO_REG(0x540)

The Datasheet for the AST2600 A3 lists the offsets as 0x520 for RNG_CTRL and 0x524 for RNG_DATA.  I can confirm that these addresses are correct on the hardware.  I don't know if the offsets changed from a previous revision, but since qemu fills the SILICON_REV register with the AST2600_A3_SILICON_REV value for the AST2600, it makes sense to me that it would use the A3 register offsets.
Steps to reproduce:
