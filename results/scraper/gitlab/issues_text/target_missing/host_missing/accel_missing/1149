Micron Xccela (MT35x) NOR Flash wrong implementation in `hw/block/m25p80.c`
Additional information:
I see that in the fork they introduced a new entry - `MAN_MICRON_OCTAL`: - https://github.com/Xilinx/qemu/blob/master/hw/block/m25p80.c

Would be nice to make it more generic, probably to call just `MAN_MICRON` and set octal mode like quad mode in other flash implementations - via the configuration register flags, especially since they could be enabled and disabled on the fly.

Also the 256 configuration registers: https://github.com/Xilinx/qemu/commit/9b2fe1e36bfd8849bb3538161279cdff6efea325
