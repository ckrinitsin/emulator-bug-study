Grabbing is not possible with menu-mode disabled
Description of problem:
When starting a Qemu and bringing it into Focus, I expected Ctrl + Alt + g to enable Input Grab mode. This does not occur when the menu-bar is hidden. It does occur when the menu-bar is visible.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a QEMU instance in a Arch / KDE host (not fullscreen)
2. Focus the instance and attempt to enable Input Grabbing (Ctrl + Alt + G)
3. Observe that Input Grab Mode is not toggled
