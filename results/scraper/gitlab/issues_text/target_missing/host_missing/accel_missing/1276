It was suggested in the SDL issue (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/6438#issuecomment-1289513402) that it's caused by the `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI` not being set. However, after setting that flag, the display is sharp again but it's not scaled properly (boxed) https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/6438#issuecomment-1291663284, no idea what other changes need to be made.
