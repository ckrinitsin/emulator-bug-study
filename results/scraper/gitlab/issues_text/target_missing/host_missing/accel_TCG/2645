Failed shutdown during record with `ide-hd` disk.
Description of problem:
Running `shutdown -h now` on the guest with an `ide-hd` disk during a recording results in a long wait, followed by a BMDMA error.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install Ubuntu Server guest OS and create disk snapshot
1. Reboot and log in: `qemu-system-x86_64 -hda ubuntu_snapshot.qcow2 -m 2g -net none -monitor stdio`
2. Take a snapshot: `savevm loggedin`
3. Start recording from VM snapshot: `./qemu/build/qemu-system-x86_64 -icount shift=auto,rr=record,rrfile=ubuntu_shutdown.bin -drive file=ubuntu_snapshot.qcow2,if=none,id=img-direct -drive driver=blkreplay,if=none,image=img-direct,id=img-blkreplay -device ide-hd,drive=img-blkreplay -loadvm loggedin -net none -m 2g`
4. Run `shutdown -h now` in guest
5. Wait (~5-10 mins)
6. Observe BMDMA error (see below)

```

Note: Running the same command on a guest with a `virtio` disk results in further progress, but still does not shut down (stuck on `[  OK  ] Stopped Create final runtime dir for shutdown pivot root.`)
