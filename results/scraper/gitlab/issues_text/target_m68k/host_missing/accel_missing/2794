qemu-system-m68k virt machine doesn't boot Linux kernels using 68020, 68030 and 68060 CPUs
Description of problem:
QEMU doesn't seem to be able to start Linux kernels using a CPU other than a 68040 (which does work fine)

To rule out host issues, the issue is reproductible on Debian Unstable amd64 (with version QEMU emulator version 9.2.0)(Debian 1:9.2.0+ds-5))

To rule out cross-compilation issues, the kernel has been rebuild inside a virt machine (using a 68040 CPU), running Debian Unstable 

Each CPU model below gets stuck early before kernel boot during the ABCGHIJK thing. The Kernel doesn't seem to boot and QEMU process eat 100% of a CPU physical core

**68020**
```
qemu-system-m68k -M virt -cpu m68060 -m 1G -nographic -kernel /home/demik/tmp/vmlinux
ABCGH
```

**68030**
```
qemu-system-m68k -M virt -cpu m68060 -m 1G -nographic -kernel /home/demik/tmp/vmlinux
ABC
```

**68060**
```
qemu-system-m68k -M virt -cpu m68060 -m 1G -nographic -kernel /home/demik/tmp/vmlinux
ABC
```
Steps to reproduce:
1. build a kernel with 68020/030/060 support (using virt_defconfig as base)
2. start QEMU with the command line above
Additional information:
68020 is understandable as it may need some sort of 68851 emulation.

Relevant Kernel config Processor configuration:
```
#
# Processor Type
#
CONFIG_M68KCLASSIC=y
# CONFIG_COLDFIRE is not set
CONFIG_M68020=y
CONFIG_M68030=y
CONFIG_M68040=y
CONFIG_M68060=y
```
