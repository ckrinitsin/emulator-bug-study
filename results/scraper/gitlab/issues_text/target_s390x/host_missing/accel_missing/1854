s390x: qemu-user: ERROR:../linux-user/elfload.c:2239:zero_bss: code should not be reached
Description of problem:
The nolibc-test program from the Linux kernel crashes since 5f4e5b34092556ab1577e25d1262bd5975b26980 .
Reverting that commit fixes the issue.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Build `nolibc-test` for s390x from Linux kernel tree. (from `tools/testing/selftests/nolibc/`). EDIT: compiled binary is uploaded below.
2. Run it under qemu-s390x.

```
 ./qemu-s390x nolibc-test
