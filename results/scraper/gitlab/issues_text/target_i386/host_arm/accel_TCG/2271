pci passthrough fails from aarch64 to amd64 guest
Description of problem:
**PCIe device Pass-thru from aarch64 host to amd64 guest fails with the below**

qemu-system-amd64: -device vfio-pci,host=0003:06:00.0: VFIO_MAP_DMA failed: Invalid argument
qemu-system-amd64: -device vfio-pci,host=0003:06:00.0: vfio 0003:06:00.0: failed to setup container for group 25: memory listener initialization failed: Region pc.ram: vfio_dma_map(0xba4058207210, 0x100000, 0xbff00000, 0xeba70a300000) = -22 (Invalid argument)

pass-thru with same command line syntax works correctly if the guest is aarch64 (qemu-system-aarch64).

AMD64 guest VM otherwise works correctly if -device vfio-pci is not used.

libvirt / virtmanager fail for aarch64 host -> amd64 guest as well.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Unbind pass-thru device from host.
2. Attach pass-thru device to vfio-pci
3. Execute qemu-system-amd64 as above.
