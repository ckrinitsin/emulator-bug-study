x86 cpu support request: LX Geode
Description of problem:
The Geode LX family of CPUs were used in early generations of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) systems (XO 1.0).

They are _basically_ i686-compatible but they lack the 'long-nop' (0x0f 0x1f) instruction available on many other i686-class devices.

Since i686 is a reasonably common baseline for toolchains and the software that is distributed using those toolchains, it would be convenient to be able to use QEMU to test boundary compatibility cases for this CPU.
Steps to reproduce:
N/A - feature does not currently exist
Additional information:
I'm not adding additional context here at the moment, but please let me know what else would be helpful to know (and/or if I'm off-track with this feature request for any reason).  Thank you!
