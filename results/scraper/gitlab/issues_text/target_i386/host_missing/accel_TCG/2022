Win32s crashes qemu (regression, bisected)
Description of problem:
Whenever I start a Win32s application (FREECELL.EXE), qemu says "qemu: Bad ram pointer 0x7f4b13a80000" and aborts. I tried a few different versions of Win32s (I specifically remember 1.15a and 1.25a), but it does not seem to matter. I am using only the standard VGA driver and nothing else that would not be present in a standard install of the guest components.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run any Win32s application
2.
3.
Additional information:
It worked fine before this commit, both on stable-8.1 as well as the master branch:
