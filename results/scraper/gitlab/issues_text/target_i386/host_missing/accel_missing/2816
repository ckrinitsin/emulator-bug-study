qemu-9.2.1 windows can not load files if kernel is linux-6.13.x
Description of problem:
qemu-9.2 and 9.2.1 emulating windows-10 both gave this
bug "externe exception 80000004." emulating windows-10
when a program tries to load a file. 
qemu emulating windows-10 runs without this bug when using
kernel linux-6.12.14 and older.
Steps to reproduce:
1.start a prog, in my case sprint-layout-6.0, try to open/load a file.
2.
3.
Additional information:
Im not shure if the bug is with qemu or kernel.
You can decide better what causes this bug.
