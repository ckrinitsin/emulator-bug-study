Is it possible to emulate QEMU 64 Bit on Windows?
Description of problem:
Is it possible to emulate 64 Bit OS on Windows QEMU version? I'm trying to emulate ESXi image but the ESXi says it can only start 32 bit VM's. When I try to start a 64 bit VM from the ESXi I get the error `Task failed on server: Module 'CPUID' power on failed. `.
