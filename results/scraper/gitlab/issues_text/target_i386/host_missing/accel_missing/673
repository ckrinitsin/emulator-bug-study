Description of problem:
The kernel refuses to mount the initramfs and proceeds to kernel panic. i didnt have this problem until qemu updated
Steps to reproduce:
I have put it all in the git repo of my project
1. git clone https://github.com/oknowaen/ltl-initramfs.git
2. cd ltl-initramfs
3. make (will start automatically)!
