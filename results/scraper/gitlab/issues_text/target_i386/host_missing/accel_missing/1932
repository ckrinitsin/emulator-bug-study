Broken grab on hover setting
Description of problem:
It seems that now qemu implements "static" grab on hover, i.e., it can only be disabled by

1. setting `vmport=off` in `-M` (btw, `pc` or `q35`, doesn't matter)
2. emulating a usb mouse *and* blacklist/unload the `psmouse` driver on the guest side

while grab on hover setting in the gtk display backend (or frontend?) is seemingly bogus now either way.

Can this be fixed (again?) so that the setting (which can be toggled in the menu "dynamically") can be used to tell this "vmport" thing whether or not it should grab on hover?
