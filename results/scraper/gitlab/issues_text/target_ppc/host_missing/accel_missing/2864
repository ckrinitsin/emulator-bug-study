qemu-system-ppc -M g3beige mouse/keyboard behave erraticaly at least since 9.0
Description of problem:
Mouse behaves very erraticaly, seemingly clicks on its own, moves auto-opened terminal window to the left
Steps to reproduce:
1. Get helenOS from https://www.helenos.org/wiki/Download
2. Boot it (need 256 Mb)
3. Try to move mouse or type anything in Terminal
Additional information:
Seemingly same issue present on netBSD (booted on qemu 9.0.4 due to regression in qemu), and macos X/9 when booted on this machine or -M mac99,via=cuda
