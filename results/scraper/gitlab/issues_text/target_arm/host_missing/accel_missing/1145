Support register name resolution in debugger part of monitor for `x` commands for ARM platforms
Additional information:
From the looks of `get_monitor_def()` function from `monitor/misc.c` it seems to be cross-target but somehow still doesn't work for some targets anyway.

Then grepping for the actual target implementation, it seems only i386, PPC, SPARC, and M68K support it, but nor ARM, MIPS, RISC V, etc:
