qemu-system-arm sabrelite does not use sd card
Description of problem:
I have build qemu from source. Furthermore I build Uboot from source following [this Link](https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/arm/sabrelite.html). With the provided command lines I am able to create and image and start the sabrelite board and see Uboot console Output. The problem I am facing is, that I am not able to interact with the provided tmp.img. 

I was also using the -driver option instead of the -blockdev option, but did not get any different results with that.
Additional information:
I provide the console output in the attached file. [console.out](/uploads/996b8c07310ec3b008477e3e70a2e629/console.out)
