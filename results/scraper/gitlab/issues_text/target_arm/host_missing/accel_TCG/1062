AArch64: SCR_EL3.RW behaves incorrectly for CPUs with no AArch32
Description of problem:
In the ARM DDI 0487G.a, D13-3572, the SCR_EL3.RW bit is defined as RAO/WI if both EL2 and EL1 don't support Aarch32. However, the function `scr_write` in `target/arm/helper.c` does not reflect this behavior, even though it checks for Aarch32 EL1 support.

This would break this EL3 code, which should run on cpu reset to attempt to return to EL1:
```asm
mov x1, #((1<<0)|(1<<2)|(1<<6)|(1<<7)|(1<<8)|(1<<9)) ; EL1h, DAIF masked
mov SPSR_EL3, x1
adr x1, 1f
msr ELR_EL3, x1
eret
1:
; something something
```
