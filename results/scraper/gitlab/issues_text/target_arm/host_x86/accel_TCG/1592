QEMU v8.0.0 crashes when running in TCG mode on windows OS
Description of problem:
This bug is a follow-up to issue #1581. 
After the patch 7d9e1ee424b06a43708be02474e6714962cfee92 is merged, QEMU segfaults at startup.
And the location where the segfault occurs here(from coredump):
```
atomic_common.c.inc:60
CMPXCHG_HELPER(cmpxchgo_le, Int128)
```
Steps to reproduce:
NA
Additional information:
1. This problem only occurs when the host system is windows, and the same QEMU configuration does not have this problem when the host system is Linux.
2. This problem is related to the -smp parameter of QEMU. If the smp parameter is 1, this problem will not occur.
3. This problem does not exist in the QEMU version 7.2.
4. What is even more confusing is that if you use gdb to load qemu and run it, this issue cannot be reproduced.
