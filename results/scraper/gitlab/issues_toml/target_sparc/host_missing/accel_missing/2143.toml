$1 = (uint16_t *) 0x808f4a7c
```
The address of s->csr[8], in this case, is on a 4-byte boundary not an 8-byte boundary, so the hack to test for 8 bytes (4 x 16-bit words) being 0 by casting the address up to a pointer to uint64_t and dereferencing it fails.

The data does not seem to be allocated with a deterministic alignment, this failure does not always occur.

A solution to avoid alignment errors could be to test
```
  (s->csr[8] | s->csr[9] | s->csr[10] | s->csr[11]) != 0
```"""
