1) Implemented in target/tricore/translate.c as
    case OPC1_16_SRO_LD_H:
        gen_offset_ld(ctx, cpu_gpr_d[15], cpu_gpr_a[r2], address, MO_LESW);
        break;

2) Should be 
    case OPC1_16_SRO_LD_H:
        gen_offset_ld(ctx, cpu_gpr_d[15], cpu_gpr_a[r2], address * 2, MO_LESW);
        break;

Detected: 
testsuite gcc9.1.0 delta analysis of Infineon Instruction Set Simulator vs. qemu-system-tricore
fix from 2) is successfull

Confidence Level for bugfix high.
Is according to spec. and in line with reference Instruction Set Simulator from Infineon.

Motivation
Reexecution of gcc/g++/libstdc++ testsuites with qemu

I honor the implementation work which was done by bkoppelmann, vo_lumit@gmx.de"""
