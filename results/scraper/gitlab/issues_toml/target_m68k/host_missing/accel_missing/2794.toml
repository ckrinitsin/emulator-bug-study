To rule out host issues, the issue is reproductible on Debian Unstable amd64 (with version QEMU emulator version 9.2.0)(Debian 1:9.2.0+ds-5))

To rule out cross-compilation issues, the kernel has been rebuild inside a virt machine (using a 68040 CPU), running Debian Unstable 

Each CPU model below gets stuck early before kernel boot during the ABCGHIJK thing. The Kernel doesn't seem to boot and QEMU process eat 100% of a CPU physical core
