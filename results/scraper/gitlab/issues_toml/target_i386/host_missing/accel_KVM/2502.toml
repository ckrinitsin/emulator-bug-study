I tried a few versions of QEMU and I can tell you that everything worked fine in 7.0.0 and it first broke in 7.1.0. I don't have a more precise bisect, sorry. I also tried in Fedora 40 with QEMU 8.2.2 and I have the same issue, so I don't think it's distro related.

On the other hand, on a completely different PC with an Intel Core i3-330M I have no issue at all, even with QEMU 8.2.3, so it might be AMD/Ryzen related."""
