The system boots, and login prompt shows up; then graphical environment startup is attempted, with Wayland (you can tell as the login prompt cursor no longer blinks, being "frozen" for possibly up to a few minutes due to emulation cost). Then the graphical startup crashes (you can tell because the cursor starts blinking again) and an X11-based startup is attempted (you can tell by the X11 cross cursor) which however never fully comes up either."""

The system used to work, but I am not sure which is the last version of QEMU where this worked, I believe 7.x. In 8.0.3 (likewise running in a Chimera environment, but it was also tested on Alpine, and I had somebody on Arch Linux test it with 8.0.2 just to rule out possible issues caused by a musl-based host environment) it crashes. It only appears to affect the `x86_64` guest architecture, as the other-architecture ISOs have graphical environment come up fine after some minutes (e.g. `ppc64le` with `qemu-system-ppc64 -M pseries-2.11,cap-htm=off -m 2048 -boot d -cdrom chimera-linux-ppc64le-LIVE-20230611-gnome.iso` works just fine). It also appears to only affect TCG emulation, as KVM likewise works fine (same command line, just `-enable-kvm` added).

Apologies for a large testcase, but it seems to need specific graphical-adjacent services to reproduce. It should be consistently reproducible though."""
