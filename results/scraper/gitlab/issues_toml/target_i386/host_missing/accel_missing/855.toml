description = """FreeBSD 10.0 panics on boot since commit: `0221d73ce6a8e075adaa0a35a6ef853d2652b855`, see my attached screenshot of the panic. 
I digged a bit into what specifically causes the issue, it seems to be caused by the precompiled `vgabios-stdvga.bin`. 
I don't see this issue come up when I compile the binary myself via the `roms/` folder with different versions of gcc via gcc docker containers. 
But once I compile the `vgabios-stdvga` from the `roms/` folder with a more modern Ubuntu version (21.10) using gcc 11.2, I also get panics on my `vgabios-stdvga`. 
At first I thought it was caused by a different gcc version, but since the buster gcc docker container images create correctly functioning `vgabios-stdvga.bin` binaries, I think this is caused by a newer version of the linker coming from the `binutils` package.

My local Ubuntu version has version 2.37 of the binutils package, the `gcc:11.2` container which compiles a correct `vgabios-stdvga.bin` has version `2.35.2` of the binutils package.
