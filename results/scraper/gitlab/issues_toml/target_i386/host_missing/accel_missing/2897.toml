I realise this is a crazy bug. I suspect that the only way it could have slipped through testing is because it *requires* human interaction.

There is no difference with using --accel kvm or not, but I have provided the smallest possible command line to duplicate the issue, which is literally just `qemu-system-x86_64 -display gtk`
