description = """for pc-q35 6.1, 7.2, any guest kernel with `ACPI: Core revision` < 20230331, can not hot plug the nvidia GPUs.
So basically only guest kernel >= 6.5 can make it work so far.
But majority of server kernels are still at 4.18, 5.x. I wonder if it possible to be fixed?
I also don't know is this qemu bug? bios bug? or actually ACPIA's bug?

workaround:
`ICH9-LPC.acpi-pci-hotplug-with-bridge-support=off` to disable the acpihp then pciehp can make it work."""
