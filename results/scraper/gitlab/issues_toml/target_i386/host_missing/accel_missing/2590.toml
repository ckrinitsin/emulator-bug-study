description = """GDB fails to load dynamically linked shared libraries when connecting to qemu-x86_64, causing it to not recognize symbols from the shared libraries. As a result, breakpoints in shared library functions (e.g, `break printf`) do not work."""
reproduce = """1. Start the debug server: `./qemu-x86_64 -g PORT ./x86_64-binary`
2. Connect GDB to the debug server:
```
$ gdb-multiarch ./x86_64-binary
(gdb) set verbose on
(gdb) target remote :PORT
```
3. GDB displays a warning and fails to load shared libraries:
```
(gdb) target remote :PORT
Remote debugging using :PORT
warning: platform-specific solib_create_inferior_hook did not load initial shared libraries.
(gdb) info sharedlibrary
No shared libraries loaded at this time.
```"""
additional = """This issue does not occur when using gdbserver on a native x86_64 machine and connecting to it from gdb-multiarch on an ARM64 machine, indicating the issue is likely related to QEMU rather than GDB. 

GDB correctly recognizes symbols from the target binary (e.g., the `main` function), and breakpoints at these symbols function as expected."""
