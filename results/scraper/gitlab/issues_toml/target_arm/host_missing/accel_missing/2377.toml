additional = """Failure happens only when debootstrapping "bullseye" with "arm64" architecture.
Older (e.g. <= "buster") and newer (e.g. > "bookworm") distros are deboostrapped OK.
Other (e.g. "armhf" and others) architectures are debootstrapped OK.

Qemu version <8.1 (e.g. 8.0.5 I use in Gentoo or versions in Debian <= bookworm) don't have the bug.

Originally faced the issue with Gentoo host. Recently rechecked with Debian Trixie host."""
