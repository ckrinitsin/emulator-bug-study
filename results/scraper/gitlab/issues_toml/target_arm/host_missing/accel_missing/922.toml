description = """I'm running ARM binaries using 32 bit qemu-arm-static on x86_64 host. Sometimes when running grep via qemu, I get a random segmentation fault. Sometimes it happens faster, sometimes it takes several thousand iterations, but sooner or later it happens and really annoying.

This problem is also reproduced on 6.2, 5.2 and 5.1 releases, and NOT reproduced on 5.0

I wrote small test to demonstrate this bug."""
reproduce = """1. Download the test environment: [qemu-test-segfault.tar.bz2](/uploads/8f52617d46ba1e5bf29fc273cd07131d/qemu-test-segfault.tar.bz2)
2. `$ make # To build the docker container`
3. `$ make shell # To run ARM bash`
4. Inside a container, run `while true; do /qemu /bin/grep -E f text > /dev/null; [ $? -ne 0 ] && break; done`. After a while you will get segfault:
