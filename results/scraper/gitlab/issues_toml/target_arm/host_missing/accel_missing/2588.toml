description = """A NonSecure execution context is able to override MMU L1 translation table
flags set by Secure context on Secure World memory.

This is not consistent with the same code running on real hardware and it's a
regression over past qemu releases as 9.0.0 behaves correctly."""

additional = """The issue relates to the fact that the NonSecure World, at startup, configures
the MMU with the NX bit for the entire address space not belonging to its
firmware .text area.

On real hardware this MMU configuration by NonSecure world does not affect the
Secure World translation tables.

On qemu 9.1.0, however it does and this is inconsistent with real hardware
behavior. On qemu 9.0.0 the behaviour is correct so the issue has been
introduced between these two releases.

The switch between Secure and NonSecure is done
[here](https://github.com/usbarmory/GoTEE/blob/7e62563c0628fed3ee0aebb4702e22be9bb636e3/monitor/exec_arm.s#L73).

The MMU first level address table which sets the NX bit is done
[here](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago/blob/273d67cd811dfcb1782c0fe596ac14d43d0ce117/arm/mmu.go#L85)."""
