Windows reports an error (Failed to pCatalog->InstallComponent.(Error: 80110401) Errors occurred accessing one or more objects - the ErrorInfo collection may have more detail) when I try to install msi. Windows reports a warning(Catalog Event ID 5488: Unable to load DLL qga-vss.dll) (Unable to validate DLL entry points) in Event Viewer.

I get msi from https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/archive-qemu-ga/qemu-ga-win-105.0.2-1.el9/qemu-ga-x86_64.msi  
Either gqa does not support ARM or this msi is only for X86 architecture?
