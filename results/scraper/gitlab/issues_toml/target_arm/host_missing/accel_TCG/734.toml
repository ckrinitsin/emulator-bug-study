In `tlbi_aa64_range_get_length` function, `num`, `scale`, `page_size_granule` is caculated as below.


```
    num = extract64(value, 39, 4);
    scale = extract64(value, 44, 2);
    page_size_granule = extract64(value, 46, 2);

    page_shift = page_size_granule * 2 + 12;
```

As [Arm documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0595/2021-06/AArch64-Instructions/TLBI-RVALE1--TLBI-RVALE1NXS--TLB-Range-Invalidate-by-VA--Last-level--EL1), NUM bits's length is 5, but the code above only extract 4bits.

And `page_shift` also should be calculated as `(page_size_granule-1) <<1) + 12` rather than `page_size_granule * 2 + 12`."""

I'm pretty sure this is one of the causes, but even if I roughly correct it, my problem has not been solved.
