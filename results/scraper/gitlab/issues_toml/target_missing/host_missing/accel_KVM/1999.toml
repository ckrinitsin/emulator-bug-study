description = """When set the interface up in vpp, the qemu process is crashed with signal sigabrt. 

After some debug, i have identified that the problem lies in the following function.

```c
static int setup_routing_entry(struct kvm *kvm,
\t\t\t       struct kvm_irq_routing_table *rt,
\t\t\t       struct kvm_kernel_irq_routing_entry *e,
\t\t\t       const struct kvm_irq_routing_entry *ue)
{
\tstruct kvm_kernel_irq_routing_entry *ei;
\tint r;
\tu32 gsi = array_index_nospec(ue->gsi, KVM_MAX_IRQ_ROUTES);

\t/*
\t * Do not allow GSI to be mapped to the same irqchip more than once.
\t * Allow only one to one mapping between GSI and non-irqchip routing.
\t */
\thlist_for_each_entry(ei, &rt->map[gsi], link)
\t\tif (ei->type != KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP ||
\t\t    ue->type != KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP ||
\t\t    ue->u.irqchip.irqchip == ei->irqchip.irqchip)
\t\t\treturn -EINVAL;

```

I added some debug printk like following

```c
        hlist_for_each_entry(ei, &rt->map[gsi], link)
                if (ei->type != KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP ||
                    ue->type != KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP ||
                    ue->u.irqchip.irqchip == ei->irqchip.irqchip){
                        printk("ei->type: %u, KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP: %u, ue->type: %u, ue->u.irqchip.irqchip: %u , ei->irqchip.irqchip: %u",  ei->type, KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP , ue->type, ue->u.irqchip.irqchip , ei->irqchip.irqchip);
                        return -EINVAL;
        }
```

Then i got following in dmesg

```
