reproduce = """1. Checkout project: [LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-ARM](https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm)
2. Configure it with option -DLLVM_TOOLCHAIN_LIBRARY_VARIANTS=armv8.1m.main_hard_nofp_mve 
3. Build project
4. Run Picolbic tests with ninja picolibc_armv8.1m.main_hard_nofp_mve-test

As a result long_double test fails with incorrect rounding.
Last qemu version which successfully execute mentioned test is: qemu 7.0.0 downloaded via [qemu-7.0.0](https://download.qemu.org/qemu-7.0.0.tar.bz2). 
Issue is present since qemu version 7.1."""
