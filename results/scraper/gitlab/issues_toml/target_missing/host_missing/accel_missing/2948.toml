description = """`-device virtio-mouse` and `-device usb-mouse` (and probably other mice which send relative mouse movement data) are behaving incorrectly under linux guest and jitter a lot. In this specific case it only seems to happen with `-display sdl` as I could not reproduce this same issue with other of the following configurations: `-display gtk` and `-display spice-app` running with virt-viewer.
This behavior is not present when running a Windows guest with the same configuration using `-display sdl`

Another weird side note: this behavior is less apparent when running `evtest` on the exact mouse device having issues.
