ERROR: missing subprojects

This is not a GIT checkout but subproject content appears to
be missing. Do not use 'git archive' or GitHub download links
to acquire QEMU source archives. Non-GIT builds are only
supported with source archives linked from:

  https://www.qemu.org/download/#source

Developers working with GIT can use scripts/archive-source.sh
if they need to create valid source archives.

```

The missing subprojects are

```
 berkeley-softfloat-3
 berkeley-testfloat-3
 dtc
 keycodemapdb
 libvfio-user
```

If I use 'make-release . 8.1.0-rc1' to create a tarball from git, it has all the expected content.

IOW, either the release tarballs are not being created using 'make-release', or there's something broken with 'make-release' in some scenarios"""
