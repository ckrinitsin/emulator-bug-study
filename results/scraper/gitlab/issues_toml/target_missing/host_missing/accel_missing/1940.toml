additional = """This happens with both the legacy virtio-fs and the rust version.

According to the first reply to https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/virtiofsd/-/issues/81 there needs to be "a lot of changes not only in virtiofsd but also in the rust-vmm crates and qemu (and maybe in the vhost-user protocol)" so I'm reporting this here in the hopes it will speed something up.

I followed the following to get virtiofsd working with command line QEMU:
https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/wiki/Virtiofs:-Shared-file-system

This is blocking our migration from VirtualBox because it doesn't have problems like this. The least I need is a work around or alternative shared filesystem. We are trying to avoid networked shares."""
