description = """This boots up a trivial guest using OVMF, when the conditions below are given it runs ~10x slower.

I have found this breaking our tests of qemu 7.2 [(which due to Debian adding the offending change as backport is affected)](https://salsa.debian.org/qemu-team/qemu/-/blob/master/debian/patches/master/acpi-cpuhp-fix-guest-visible-maximum-access-size-to-.patch) by runnig an order of magnitude slower.


I was tracing it down (insert a long strange trip here) and found that it occurs:
- only with patch dab30fb "acpi: cpuhp: fix guest-visible maximum access size to the legacy reg block" applied
  - latest master is still affetced
- only with s390x running emulation of x86
  - emulating x86 on ppc64 didn't show the same behavior
- only with -smp > host cpus
  - smp 2 with 1 host cpu => slow
  - smp 4 with 2 host cpu => slow
  - any case where host cpu >= smp => fast

On average good cases are on a 2964 s390x machine taking ~5-6 seconds for the good case.
The bad case is close to 60s which is the timeout of the automated tests.

We all know -smp shouldn't be >host-cpus, and I totally admit that this is the definition of an edge case.
But I do not know what else might be affected and this just happened to be what the test does by default - and a slowdown by x10 seems too much even for edge cases to be just ignored.
And while we could just bump up the timeout (and probably will as an interim workaround) I wanted to file it here for your awareness."""

Highlighting @cborntra since it is somewhat s390x related and @mjt0k as the patch is applied as backport in Debian.
I didn't find the handle of Laszlo (Author) to highlight him as well."""
