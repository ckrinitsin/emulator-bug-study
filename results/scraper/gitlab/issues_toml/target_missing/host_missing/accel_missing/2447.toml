VM window is not necessary to be resized to reproduce this bug. If your VM desktop comes 1920x1080 originally, the bug can be reproduced from the very start.

Smaller resolutions show this bug too, but it not so noticeable."""
reproduce = """1. Download and install official QEMU 9.0 from https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/qemu-w64-setup-20240423.exe
2. Go to https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines and click big QEMU 64 icon, and wait till kali-linux-2024.2-qemu-amd64.7z has been downloaded
3. Extract kali-linux-2024.2-qemu-amd64.qcow2 from kali-linux-2024.2-qemu-amd64.7z
4. Run it: `qemu-system-x86_64.exe -accel tcg -device virtio-vga-gl -display sdl,gl=on -hda C:\\kali-linux-2024.2-qemu-amd64.qcow2 -usb -device usb-tablet -m 4096 -machine q35 -smp 2 -cpu Westmere`
5. Enter `kali` as user and `kali` as password when prompted
6. When the desktop is shown up, click the leftmost, upmost blue "Applications" button. Then click Settings -\\> Display
7. Pick 1920x1080 as resolution and click Apply, then Keep this configuration.
8. Click Firefox Browser icon on the top panel.
9. When the browser starts working, experience how hard to use its interface, though it's fast. Real mouse position is nearly 100 px on the left of drawn cursor. The closer the cursor to the lower right corner of the VM window, the worse (divergence becomes way bigger than 100 px)."""

Mouse in Gtk mode works ok. OpenGL not available for Windows in GTK mode."""
