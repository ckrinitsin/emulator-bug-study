2. Build UEFI SCT (commit 81dfa8d53d4290) for riscv64
3. Run the UEFI SCT
4. Observe the message "qemu: virtio: bogus descriptor or out of resources" after which the execution stalls.

The full procedure is described in https://github.com/xypron/sct_release_test

To save time you can call `sct -u` and select only test 'MediaAccessTest\\\\BlockIOProtocolTest'. Run it with `F9`."""
additional = """virtqueue_map_desc() may be called for a large buffers size `sz`. It will then call dma_memory_map() multiple times in a loop. In address_space_map() `bounce.in_use` is set to `true` on the first call. Each subsequent call is bound to fail.

To verify this is the cause I applied the following diff:

```plaintext

and saw this output:
