description = """There is a difference between a qcow2 file image and a lvqcow2 img.

'write' lock will be checked when using a normal qcow2-format image (/path/to/img/test.qcow2) to avoid some risky operations. However, when I create a qcow2 img on a lv, there is not any write lock checked when I perform `qemu-img check` on this lvqcow2 even though it was attached to a vm."""
reproduce = """1. create a lvqcow2: `qemu-img create -f qcow2 /path/to/lv  xxG`
2. create a vm using this lvqcow2
3. exec `qemu-img check` on this lvqcow2, there is no any perm (such as 'write' lock) check and notifaction even though this lvqcow2 is using in qemu vm."""
