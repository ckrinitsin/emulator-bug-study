description = """Lenient instruction decoding of `vldi` and `xvldi` leads to Qemu crashes.

The decoding of `vldi` and `xvldi` instruction allows for instructions with illegal immediates.

`target/loongarch/insns.decode`:

```
vldi             0111 00111110 00 ............. .....     @v_i13
xvldi            0111 01111110 00 ............. .....     @v_i13
```

This is considered in `target/loongarch/tcg/insn_trans/trans_vec.c.inc`:

```C
    /*
     * imm bit [11:8] is mode, mode value is 0-12.
     * other values are invalid.
     */
```

However, an assertion error is raised when this condition is violated and qemu crashes:

```
**
ERROR:target/loongarch/insn_trans/trans_vec.c.inc:3574:vldi_get_value: code should not be reached
Bail out! ERROR:target/loongarch/insn_trans/trans_vec.c.inc:3574:vldi_get_value: code should not be reached
```

On hardware (Loongson 3A5000), these instructions cause a SIGILL."""
