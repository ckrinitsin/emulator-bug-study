much of the code in crypto/aes.c accesses memory arrays where the array index is based on the secret data being encrypted/decrypted. because of cpu caches and other things that can delay memory accesses based on their address, this is a timing side-channel, potentially allowing leaking secrets over a network based on timing how long cryptography operations take.

compare to openssl which uses an algorithm where its execution time doesn't depend on the data being processed:
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/0051746e03c65f5970d8ca424579d50f58a877e0

I initially reported this as a security issue, but was told that since it's only used by TCG, it isn't a security issue, since TCG isn't considered secure."""
