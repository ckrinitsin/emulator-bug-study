description = """In a TCG plugin, using the `qemu_plugin_reset` method from within a `vcpu_tb_trans` callback produces the following error. If this isn't a supported use case, it should probably be described in the documentation. If this is supposed to work, it doesn't seem to.

reproduce = """1. Build the current head of master (4b7ea33074450bc6148c8e1545d78f179e64adb4) with the below `min` plugin (i.e., add to contrib/plugins and update contrib/plugins/Makefile so it is built)
2. `../configure --enable-plugins --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --disable-docs`
3. `make && make plugins`
4. Get a qcow, e.g., the Ubuntu Bionic qcow from [here](https://panda.re/qcows/linux/ubuntu/1804/x86_64/bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64-noaslr-nokaslr.qcow2).
5. `./qemu-system-x86_64 -plugin contrib/plugins/libmin.so bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64-noaslr-nokaslr.qcow2 -nographic`

The first three lines are output by the plugin as expected, the error after that and the abort are unexpected:
```
Translating basic block
Reset request issued
Reset finished
