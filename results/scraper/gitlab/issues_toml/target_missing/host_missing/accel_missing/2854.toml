Then you can click "documentation"

Then "main documentation section"

Then "system emulation"

Then "introduction"

At this point you have something that sort-of is viable as hello world.

Maybe link https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/introduction.html from main page ("Full-system emulation")?

Unless there is a better documentation?

Though maybe someone who will not go through this link maze should not try to use QEMU at all?"""
