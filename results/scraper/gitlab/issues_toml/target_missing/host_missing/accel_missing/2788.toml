description = """The distro work but does not take input from either keyboard or mouse.
At the boot menu (syslinux) where I have to choose the boot mode the keyboard works, but it stops working when the desktop has booted.
The distro is not blocked I can tell by observing that the clock in the panel keeps running and if I click in the qemu menubar on machine > power down, the distro correctly performs the shutdown procedure.
I have tried other distributions (porteus and tinycore) and both do not have this problem.
I also tried using as -display vnc and sdl but I have the same problem.
I am using a [portable version of qemu](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/new) but I also tried with the repository version having the same problem."""
