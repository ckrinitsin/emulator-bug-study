additional = """This was extremely annoying because the total abort occurs far into the installation, while setting up the network. The devices (presumably including the vvfat) had been installed OK. The XP installation can be restarted without the CD but starts at the beginning, needing location, passwords, licence key etc. all over again! I have XP64 installed now, without vvfat which is a marvellously convenient way of transferring files.

BTW "vfat" usually means extended FAT, handling files over 4GB but vvfat does not. Can you fix that?"""
