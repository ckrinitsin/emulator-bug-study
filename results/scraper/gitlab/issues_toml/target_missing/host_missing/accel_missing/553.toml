While qemu configured without `--enabled-modules` runs this command successfully."""

2. Build qemu `mkdir build && cd build && ../configure && ninja`

      -object memory-backend-memfd,id=mem1,size=512M \\
      -machine memory-backend=mem1 \\
      -display sdl \\

4. Then try to build with modules enabled  `mkdir build && cd build && ../configure --enable-modules && ninja`
5. Try to do step 3 again"""
additional = """I tried to debug this bug, and found that problem is with function `virtio_gpu_have_udmabuf`: when qemu is build without modules this function is from `hw/display/virtio-gpu-udmabuf.c` (which is correct), but when qemu compiled with modules this function comes from `stubs/virtio-gpu-udmabuf.c` and when `hw-display-virtio-gpu.so` is loaded, `virtio_gpu_have_udmabuf` is not replaced, and remains function from stub (which always return 0) and command fails.

I think I will submit patch that fix it tomorrow"""
