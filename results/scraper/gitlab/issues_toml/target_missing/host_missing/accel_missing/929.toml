description = """This seems very similar to the issue reported here (https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1926996). When attempting to perform the clone syscall, an error of -1 is returned where I would expect it to succeed. Running the same executable outside of qemu works as expected."""

additional = """I've tried building with gcc, zig cc, and clang and the output of each works fine when running natively, but running under qemu fails. I originally discovered it when cross compiling to riscv64 but it doesn't seem to be limited to that architecture.
