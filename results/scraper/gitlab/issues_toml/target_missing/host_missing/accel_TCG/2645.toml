3. Start recording from VM snapshot: `./qemu/build/qemu-system-x86_64 -icount shift=auto,rr=record,rrfile=ubuntu_shutdown.bin -drive file=ubuntu_snapshot.qcow2,if=none,id=img-direct -drive driver=blkreplay,if=none,image=img-direct,id=img-blkreplay -device ide-hd,drive=img-blkreplay -loadvm loggedin -net none -m 2g`

6. Observe BMDMA error (see below)"""
