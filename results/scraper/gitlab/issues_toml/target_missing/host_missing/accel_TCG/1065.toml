description = """When a TCG cpu accesses an unmapped page within an IOMMU region that causes a translation fault, QEMU SIGSEGVs in `io_readx`.
The reason was that in `address_space_translate_for_iotlb`, `xlat` is not set on a permission fault.
As a result, `xlat` in `tlb_set_page_with_attr` is uninitialized. This in turn causes various mis-calculation and eventually crashes in `io_readx`."""
