description = """JRE (HotSpot Runtime) errors with SIGSEGV on x86 Linux Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS when it is emulated on Apple Silicon M2. In this case, JRE is being triggered by SBT that is running Scala source code.

This could be a Qemu issue, an OpenJDK issue, an Apple issue, etc. - Let me know if this is the wrong place/not under the purview of Qemu and I'll post it somewhere else."""
reproduce = """I am attempting to run a Scala project (https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard) on a x86 machine emulated on an Apple Silicon device. The project build flow fails on step 5 when Scala sources are compiled and run. You can reproduce the issue by running Chipyard's recommended setup flow here:

https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Chipyard-Basics/Initial-Repo-Setup.html#default-requirements-installation

Then instead of running the given build-setup command in the tutorial, run `./build-setup.sh riscv-tools -s 3 -s 8 -s 7 -s 8 -s 9 -s 10 --use-lean-conda` in order to skip the irrelevant setup steps.

The SBT build config is in the project's base directory under build.sbt. There is a commonSettings sequence that is inherited by each subsequent project. The flow: line 409 of common.mk is triggered by line 257 & 258 of build-setup.sh, which then triggers SBT with some arguments passed into the SBT executable."""
