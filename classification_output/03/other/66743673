[Bug] QEMU TCG warnings after commit c6bd2dd63420 - HTT / CMP_LEG bits

Hi Community,

This email contains 3 bugs appear to share the same root cause.

[1] We ran into the following warnings when running QEMU v10.0.0 in TCG mode:

qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -machine q35 \
  -m 4G -smp 4 \
  -kernel ./arch/x86/boot/bzImage \
  -bios /usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd \
  -drive file=~/kernel/rootfs.ext4,index=0,format=raw,media=disk \
  -drive file=~/kernel/swap.img,index=1,format=raw,media=disk \
  -nographic \
  -append 'root=/dev/sda rw resume=/dev/sdb console=ttyS0 nokaslr'
qemu-system-x86_64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature:
CPUID.01H:EDX.ht [bit 28]
qemu-system-x86_64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature:
CPUID.80000001H:ECX.cmp-legacy [bit 1]
(repeats 4 times, once per vCPU)
Tracing the history shows that commit c6bd2dd63420 "i386/cpu: Set up CPUID_HT in
x86_cpu_expand_features() instead of cpu_x86_cpuid()" is what introduced the
warnings.
Since that commit, TCG unconditionally advertises HTT (CPUID 1 EDX[28]) and
CMP_LEG (CPUID 8000_0001 ECX[1]). Because TCG itself has no SMT support, these
bits trigger the warnings above.
[2] Also, Zhao pointed me to a similar report on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/2894
The symptoms there look identical to what we're seeing.
By convention we file one issue per email, but these two appear to share the
same root cause, so I'm describing them together here.
[3] My colleague Alan noticed what appears to be a related problem: if we launch
a guest with '-cpu <model>,-ht --enable-kvm', which means explicitly removing
the ht flag, but the guest still reports HT(cat /proc/cpuinfo in linux guest)
enabled. In other words, under KVM the ht bit seems to be forced on even when
the user tries to disable it.
Best regards,
Ewan

It was caused by my two patches. I think the fix can be as follow.
If no objection from the community, I can submit the formal patch.

[3] My colleague Alan noticed what appears to be a related problem: if
we launch a guest with '-cpu <model>,-ht --enable-kvm', which means
explicitly removing the ht flag, but the guest still reports HT(cat /
proc/cpuinfo in linux guest) enabled. In other words, under KVM the ht
bit seems to be forced on even when the user tries to disable it.
This has been the behavior of QEMU for many years, not some regression
introduced by my patches. We can discuss how to address it separately.

This fix is fine for me...at least from SDM, HTT depends on topology and
it should exist when user sets "-smp 4".

I haven't found any other thread :-).

By the way, just curious, in what cases do you need to disbale the HT
flag? "-smp 4" means 4 cores with 1 thread per core, and is it not
enough?

As for the â-htâ behavior, I'm also unsure whether this should be fixed
or not - one possible consideration is whether â-htâ would be useful.

I wasn't trying to target any specific use case, using "-ht" was simply a way to
check how the ht feature behaves under both KVM and TCG. There's no special
workload behind it; I just wanted to confirm that the flag is respected (or not)
in each mode.
