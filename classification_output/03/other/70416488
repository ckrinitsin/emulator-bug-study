[Bug Report] smmuv3 event 0x10 report when running virtio-blk-pci

Hi All,

When I tested mainline qemu(commit 7b87a25f49), it reports smmuv3 event 0x10
during kernel booting up.

qemu command which I use is as below:

qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt,kernel_irqchip=on,gic-version=3,iommu=smmuv3 \
-kernel Image -initrd minifs.cpio.gz \
-enable-kvm -net none -nographic -m 3G -smp 6 -cpu host \
-append 'rdinit=init console=ttyAMA0 ealycon=pl0ll,0x90000000 maxcpus=3' \
-device 
pcie-root-port,port=0x8,chassis=0,id=pci.0,bus=pcie.0,multifunction=on,addr=0x2 
\
-device pcie-root-port,port=0x9,chassis=1,id=pci.1,bus=pcie.0,addr=0x2.0x1 \
-device 
virtio-blk-pci,drive=drive0,id=virtblk0,num-queues=8,packed=on,bus=pci.1 \
-drive file=/home/boot.img,if=none,id=drive0,format=raw

smmuv3 event 0x10 log:

Another information is that if "maxcpus=3" is removed from the kernel command 
line,
it will be OK.

I am not sure if there is a bug about vsmmu. It will be very appreciated if 
anyone
know this issue or can take a look at it.

Thanks,
Zhou

Does it still do this if you either:
 (1) use the v9.1.0 release (commit fd1952d814da)
 (2) use "-machine virt-9.1" instead of "-machine virt"

?

My suspicion is that this will have started happening now that
we expose an SMMU with two-stage translation support to the guest
in the "virt" machine type (which we do not if you either
use virt-9.1 or in the v9.1.0 release).

I've cc'd Eric (smmuv3 maintainer) and Mostafa (author of
the two-stage support).

Thank you for reporting. I am able to reproduce and effectively the
maxcpus kernel option is triggering the issue. It works without. I will
come back to you asap.

I tested above two cases, the problem is still there.
I have not much progressed yet but I see it comes with
qemu traces.

smmuv3-iommu-memory-region-0-0 translation failed for iova=0x0
(SMMU_EVT_F_TRANSLATION)
../..
qemu-system-aarch64: virtio-blk failed to set guest notifier (-22),
ensure -accel kvm is set.
qemu-system-aarch64: virtio_bus_start_ioeventfd: failed. Fallback to
userspace (slower).

the PCIe Host bridge seems to cause that translation failure at iova=0

Also virtio-iommu has the same issue:
qemu-system-aarch64: virtio_iommu_translate no mapping for 0x0 for sid=1024
qemu-system-aarch64: virtio-blk failed to set guest notifier (-22),
ensure -accel kvm is set.
qemu-system-aarch64: virtio_bus_start_ioeventfd: failed. Fallback to
userspace (slower).

Only happens with maxcpus=3. Note the virtio-blk-pci is not protected by
the vIOMMU in your case.

Thanks

Can you please provide logs with adding "-d trace:smmu*" to qemu invocation.

Also if possible, can you please provide which Linux kernel version
you are using, I will see if I can repro.

Sure. Please see the attached log(using above qemu commit and command).

I just use the latest mainline kernel(commit b831f83e40a2) with defconfig.

Thanks a lot, it seems the SMMUv3 indeed receives a translation
request with addr 0x0 which causes this event.
I don't see any kind of modification (alignment) of the address in this path.
So my hunch it's not related to the SMMUv3 and the initiator is
issuing bogus addresses.

I just use the latest mainline kernel(commit b831f83e40a2) with defconfig.

I see, I can't repro in my setup which has no "--enable-kvm" and with
"-cpu max" instead of host.
I will try other options and see if I can repro.
