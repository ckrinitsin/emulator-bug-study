We have this gitlab issue for the project qemu. This is a semantic mistranslation bug:

x86 BLSMSK semantic bug
Host environment

Operating system: Windows 10 20H2
OS/kernel version: WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.10.102.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 x86_64)
Architecture: x86
QEMU flavor: qemu-x86_64
QEMU version: 7.1.90 (v7.2.0-rc0)
QEMU command line: qemu-x86_64 -cpu max a.out

Emulated/Virtualized environment

Operating system: None
OS/kernel version: None
Architecture: x86

Description of problem
The result of instruction BLSMSK is different with from the CPU. The value of CF is different.

Steps to reproduce

Compile this code

void main() {
    asm("mov rax, 0x65b2e276ad27c67");
    asm("mov rbx, 0x62f34955226b2b5d");
    asm("blsmsk eax, ebx");
}

Execute and compare the result with the CPU.
CPU CF = 0
QEMU CF = 1

For the following mailing thread, output only a toml with the corresponding variables. If an information cannot be gathered, put "n/a" instead. But you have to determine, if it is a semantic bug or not:
