Reading /proc/self/task/<pid>/maps is not remapped to the target

Seeing this in qemu-user 3.1.0

The code in is_proc_myself which supports remapping of /proc/self/maps and /proc/<pid>/maps does not support remapping of /proc/self/task/<pid>/maps or /proc/<pid>/task/<pid>/maps. Extending is_proc_myself to cover these cases causes the maps to be rewritten correctly.

These are useful in multithreaded programs to avoid freezing the entire program to capture the maps for a single tid.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Code inspection shows we still don't handle /proc/self/task.



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
