qemu-system-ppc : file  systems are not shutting down clean 




Launching a VM that has been shutdown gracefully ( via init 0)  typically requires fsck to run when it is started ;
This indications data integrity issues;


 The symptom can be seen by observing the fsck running when the VM restarted.

Install 14-04-LTS to a VM  and the issue can be seen ;



(trusty)vnc@jade-rev4:/home2/qemu$ cat vm1/go.sh
mymac="52:54:00:12:34:10"
T=` echo $mymac | cut -d: -f5,6 | sed s/\://`
mytap="tap$T"


tunctl  -d $mytap
tunctl  -t $mytap

Can you explain what "ssgyboot=break" tells the kernel to do?

Could you upload the guest's /var/log/syslog after reboot?

Please show

echo $?

immediately after the qemu-system-ppc command has exited?

1. ssgyboot-break has no effect in the VM  kernel; It is only used by jade-initrd-2.0.bin  ; 

  kernel cmdline:

[    0.000000] pcpu-alloc: s28800 r8192 d16256 u53248 alloc=13*4096
[    0.000000] pcpu-alloc: [0] 0

 root=/dev/vda1 ro quiet splash vt.handoff=7

2: see attached file . 

3. VM's do not exit from qemu-system-ppc ; see defect :   1317603 . 



/var/log/syslog   attached as syslog.onboot when file system is dirty ;

Since the VM terminated ; the device should have been umounted ;

I am thinking since the VM hasn't terminated due to defect 1317603 ,  qemu-system-ppc has to be terminated with kill  <pid>  which is not kill -9  ; I could see some inconsistencies with virtio device file not being sync'ed ; but the VM did unmount it;
