keyboard errors in DOS, found links to similar errors for reference

OS: slackware 14.2, updated. qemu version: 4.1.0 (from slackbuild script)

command line: qemu-system-i386 -hda msdos.vhd

Description of problem: MSDOS 6.22 disk image running gwbasic 3.23. Cursor keys and sometimes letter keys are repeated. Cursor keys seemingly always, letter keys seem to happen when typing too fast.  Numpad arrows are not affected.  Also insert key doesnt seem to work at all.

Have found one similar current bug, Bug #1574246 Drunken keyboard in go32v2 programs https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1574246?comments=all and a much older vbox bug report that seems very similar, https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/58 , and for some reason mentions a qemu patch.

Also seems similar to https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1897568

Could you please check whether the patch mentioned in https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1897568 fixes this problem here, too?

Which source version should I be applying that patch to? It's partially failing on 4.1.0, 5.0.0, and 6.0.0

Hmm, you likely need the whole patch series, and not only a single patch...

If you've got a git checkout and b4 installed, you could try:

 b4 am <email address hidden>
 git am ./v2_20210507_vr_qemu_ps_2_controller_related_fixes.mbx

Otherwise it's maybe easier to wait until the patches have been merged...


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
