Switching from the monitor to the emulated machine with a French keyboard (AZERTY)

Hi,
I run qemu in an xterm terminal, with TERM=vt100. My keyboard is french AZERTY.

sudo ./qemu-system-hppa -monitor /dev/pts/2 -k fr  -boot d -drive if=scsi,bus=0,index=5,file=../../hpux_11iv1.img,format=raw -serial mon:stdio -D qemu1.log -nographic -m 512 -d nochain -cdrom ../../distri/11iv1/'HP-UX_11iv1_B.11.11_TCOE_September_2005_1of4_Core_OS _Install&Recovery_B6821-10046.iso' -net nic,model=tulip  -net tap

When I want to use the monitor (to change cdrom during the hp-ux installation process), the characters I type are misinterpreted. For example, I enter "2" at hp-ux prompt, I see : "412691;82;22". Impossible to switch from monitor to hp-ux with Ctrl+Alt+1 and Ctrl+Alt+2.

I tried with Debian and Fedora host, TERM=xterm and TERM=vt100, qemu options -alt-grab and -ctrl-grab, -monitor in the same terminal or an other terminal than hp-ux. Nothing works.
Best regards.

In an xterm to switch to/from QEMU monitor use "Ctrl-A c"

Thank you for your reply. It works well with "Ctrl-A c" to swith to and from QEMU monitor in xterm terminal.

The problem is elsewhere, with the option -monitor. With "-monitor <tty device>", whether <tty device> is or not the tty from which qemu is started, the characters I type are misinterpreted. Maybe I must report this bug ?

Now, I remove the -monitor option, and I add "-serial mon:telnet::4444,server" before "-serial mon:stdio". I enter the following command in a first xterm, and "telnet localhost 4444" in a second xterm. So, qemu monitor works fine in the first xterm, and HP-UX installation menu is correctly displayed in the second xterm.

The command :
sudo ./qemu-system-hppa  -boot d -drive if=scsi,bus=0,index=5,file=../../hpux_11.00.img,format=raw  -serial mon:telnet::4444,server -serial mon:stdio -nographic -m 512 -d nochain -cdrom ../../distri/11.00/'HP-UX 11.0 (2002-06).iso' -D qemu.log -net nic,model=tulip  -net tap

Now, I will try to use the graphic mode.
Have a nice day,

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
