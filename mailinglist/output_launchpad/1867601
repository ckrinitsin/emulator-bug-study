test-char not concurrent with unix socket

'make check-unit' might fail when running multiple tests in parallel.

Apparently occurred on OSX CI:
https://travis-ci.org/github/philmd/qemu/jobs/662357430

Guess is same unix path used:

static SocketAddress unixaddr = {
    .type = SOCKET_ADDRESS_TYPE_UNIX,
    .u.q_unix.path = (char *)"test-char.sock",
};

Note, other tests in this file use g_dir_make_tmp().

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
