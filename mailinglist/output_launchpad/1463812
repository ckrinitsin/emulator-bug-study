qemu-system-ppc64 V2.30 cause RHEL5.9 disk corruption

copied the RHEL5.9 power disk image from qemu 1.5.3, run it under qemu 2.3.0, corrupted; copied again, run, corrupted again.
Run the image on qemu 1.5.3, no problem.

Hi,
  Can you add some details about your host and guest please:
    1) What's your host system? (ppc64 or x86? which os?)
    2) What's the guest disk image format - raw or qcow2?
    3) could you try some of the versions in between 2.3.0 and 1.5.3 ?
    4) Is it just the 5.9 image that has problems or is it more general?

Dave

Oh and:
   5) What's your disk image stored on - local disk or network?
   6) WHat's the command line you're using for your guest

2.3.0 running RHEL7,1 little-endian version no problem.

I'm using: qemu-system-ppc64 -hda ppcrhel5.img -cpu POWER7 -machine type=pseries,usb=off -m 768 -nographic -net nic -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no
It's on local disk.
same as on qemu 1.5.3.

I'm running qemu 2.3.0 on a RHEL5.3/x86 box, 1.5.3 on a CentOS6.6/x86 box.

if you're running the 2.3.0 on the RHEL5.3 and the 1.53 on CentOS6.6 we can't know if the problem
is with the qemu 2.3.0 or with running it on the older host?  Please run the two qemus on the same host
and see if the problem follows the host or the qemu version.

Also, just checking;  is that 64bit x86 host or 32 ?


and I've just seen your older bug report - https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1289898 - isn't this exactly the same problem? Why open a new bug?

Both X86_64.

I already forgot the old one: I got a 2.3.0 qemu installed on the RHEL 5.3 machine, and since this machine has more disk spaces than the CentOS6.4 (now 6.6), so I copied again all emulated machine images from CentOS to RHEL machine, and started to build a new one for RHEL7.1 LE for Power on the 2.3.0, and found it's working quite well, and also other emulated machines are all working fine (mips32, mips32el, mips64el, armv7) on the 2.3.0.Then I just tried to use the RHEL5.9 Power qemu machine, but found root filesystem corrupted, copied from OS image from CentOS, start the qemu machine, again, root filesystem damaged. So, I created the bug report,  didn't think about old bug report I made. So, now it's clear, it's on the RHEL5.3 machine, multiple qemu versions have issue with RHEL5.9 for power.

I built 2.3.0 on CentOS 6.6 machine, and run the RHEL5.9 using the new qemu-system-64 ,and gets the same issue as 2.3.0 on RHEL5.3:

Checking filesystems
Checking all file systems.
[/sbin/fsck.ext3 (1) -- /] fsck.ext3 -a /dev/sda5
/: Resize inode not valid.

/: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.
        (i.e., without -a or -p options)
[FAILED]

As I stated before on the CentOS6.6, the qemu 1.5.3 running the RHEL5.9 for power is ok. That proves it's not because of RHEL5.3 machine that fs is corrupted, it's the newer qemu for power emulation has issue to run big-endian version of RHEL.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

It seems to me that no one has really looked into the matter, I can't find any comments,that this issue has been worked on.
