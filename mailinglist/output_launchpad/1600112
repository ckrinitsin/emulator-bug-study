Qemu GTK interface showing question marks instead of correct strings

Qemu version: 2.6.0

When running Qemu system emulation (configured with GTK interface), all interface strings shows up as question marks instead of the correct translated strings. Tested on locale zh_CN.UTF-8.

I have attached a screenshot below for better understanding.



The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
