system_powerdown NOT working in qemu-kvm with KVM enabled for FreeBSD guests

system_powerdown stops working in qemu-kvm for FreeBSD guests if KVM is enabled.

How to reproduce:

1. qemu -cdrom ~/.VirtualBox/libvirt/FreeBSD-8.1-RELEASE-i386-bootonly.iso
2. Enter system_powerdown in the qemu console
3. Nothing happens.

Adding --no-kvm option makes system_powerdown work:

1. qemu --no-kvm -cdrom ~/.VirtualBox/libvirt/FreeBSD-8.1-RELEASE-i386-bootonly.iso
2. system_powerdown
3. FreeBSD installer shows the shutdown dialog as expected

Tested on FreeBSD 6.4, 7.2, and 8.0 with qemu-kvm 0.12.5 and older versions.

The subject should be: system_powerdown is NOT working - can someone correct this please?

I have the same issue with FreeBSD 8.1-RELEASE (i386 and x86_64) on qemu-kvm 0.12.5 (Fedora 13)

system_powerdown works properly for Linux and Windows 2008 guests, but not for FreeBSD The ACPI power button event is not received by the FreeBSD guest.

I found this (unconfirmed) status report:

So it seems to be a regression...



This is fixed upstream (in seabios actually) by commit 6d5a2172f2b76900572107868ec080400c4f615d -- see http://git.linuxtogo.org/?p=kevin/seabios.git;a=commit;h=6d5a2172f2b76900572107868ec080400c4f615d .  I added this patch to Debian releases of qemu-kvm, both for squeeze and experimental.

The updated bios.bin works fine for me, thanks.

Marking this now as "Fix released" according to comment #3
