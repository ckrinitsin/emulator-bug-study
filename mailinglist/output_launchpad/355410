kvm crashed with SIGSEGV in malloc_consolidate()

Binary package hint: kvm

See Bug #355401. Oddly enough, when Windows tries to install drivers for a WDM device (a W380a on USB), kvm crashes.

Hi, thanks for the report.

Can you give me any hints about what's going on when you see this issue?

I see you're doing USB passthrough, which can be a little be tricky.  Can you reproduce the problem without USB passthrough?

:-Dustin

The specific USB device used is conditional on reproducing this bug. As such, I can't just reproduce this without the device.

Right, sorry about that.  I realized that just after I typed my
response.  My bad...

:-Dustin

This could fix it.

This should be qemu-0.11.0 which should be released soon.

Marking triaged, against the qemu-kvm project.  Upstream QEMU has a pending fix for this (or at least something very, very similar).

As soon as this lands in qemu-kvm-0.11, we should get this in Karmic.

:-Dustin

We should be getting qemu-0.11 GA into Karmic early next week.

I'll ping here once it's uploaded.

:-Dustin

Can you please re-test this?

We strongly suspect that this is fixed in Karmic now.

Please re-open the bug, if you can still reproduce it.

:-Dustin

Commit c4c0e236beabb9de5ff mentioned in comment #5 has been included long ago, so setting this ticket to "Fix released" now.
