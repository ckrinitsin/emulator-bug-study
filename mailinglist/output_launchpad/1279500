system_powerdown causes SMP OpenBSD guest to freeze

system_powerdown causes an SMP OpenBSD guest to freeze. I can reproduce it with the following systems/versions:

  - Debian 6: QEMU PC emulator version 0.12.5 (qemu-kvm-0.12.5)
  - Fedora 20:
     qemu-system-x86-1.6.1 (from Fedora repository)
     qemu-1.7.0 (latest release version)
     qemu-1.7.50 (latest development snapshot, "git cloned" today, 20140212)

all of the above hosts are running x86_64 linux.

The first OpenBSD version that I ran as a VM, v5.1, experienced the problem. All subsequent versions experience the problem. The above tests were performed using OpenBSD v5.4 (amd64).

I will open an OpenBSD bug report for this problem as well, and update this report with the OpenBSD bug ID.

There's an interesting RedHat bug report concerning this problem:

I posted patch to provide correct PCI irq routing info in mptable to kvm 
mailing list. It works for all devices except for SCI interrupt. BIOS
programs SCI interrupt to be 9 as spec requires, but OpenBSD thinks that
it is smarter and moves it to interrupts 10. Qemu will still send it on
vector 9 and OpenBSD will enter the same infinity recursion. This can
be triggered by issuing system_powerdown on qemu monitor.

Michael Tokarev reported this problem on the kvm mailing list in 2011:
  URL: http://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg51311.html

I compiled qemu as follows:
-snip-
cd qemu-src-dir
mkdir -p bin/native
cd bin/native
../../configure \
	--prefix=/usr/local/qemu-dev-snapshot-20140212 \
	--target-list=x86_64-softmmu \

I opened an OpenBSD bug. OpenBSD does not use a bug-tracking database, AFAICT, but rather the mailing-list <email address hidden>. I will post any replies to the OpenBSD bug report in comments here.

hoping to increase the OpenBSD developers' inclination to investigate this bug, I reproduced it using OpenBSD 5.4 as the host.

I used the stock qemu-1.5.1 that is available as an OpenBSD package. Booting the GENERIC.MP kernel in the VM was painfully slow, but it eventually came up to multi-user mode.

The script to run the OpenBSD 5.4 guest on the OpenBSD 5.4 host:
-snip-
#!/bin/sh

qemu-system-x86_64 \
        -S \
        -m 2048 \
        -smp 2,sockets=2,cores=1,threads=1 \
        -monitor stdio \
        -vnc :0 \
        -no-fd-bootchk \
        -net nic \
        -net user \
        -cdrom /space/install54.iso \
        -drive file=/space/obsd54test.raw,index=0,media=disk,cache=none,format=raw
-snip-

As usual, issuing the "system_powerdown" command in the monitor caused the guest to freeze totally.

If someone needs to coordinate with someone from the OpenBSD team, please talk to Mike Larkin <email address hidden>. He expressed an intention to look into this problem from the OpenBSD side. I would be delighted if I could supply Mike with a qemu contact person, of if someone could contact him directly (and copy me, please), as I think he wanted to investigate shortly.

Also worth mentioning: the problem can be reproduced using the OpenBSD uniprocessor kernel in the guest, as long as mpbios(4) is enabled, which is the default. Thus, a VM configured with a single CPU is sufficient to reproduce.

To boot the uniprocessor kernel from my guest image, at the OpenBSD boot prompt, type "boot /bsd". To make it permanent, edit /etc/boot.conf and change "bsd.mp" to "bsd", or remove boot.conf entirely.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU and OpenBSD? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
