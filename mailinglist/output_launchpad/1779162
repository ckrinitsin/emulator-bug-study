qemu versions 2.10 and 2.11 have error during migration of larger guests

== Comment: #0 - Christian Borntraeger  - 2018-06-28 06:39:27 ==
Migration fails with larger guests (e.g. 10GB)  on a z system prints an error message in the log 

see /var/log/libvirt/qemu/...
[...]
qemu-system-s390x: KVM_S390_SET_CMMA_BITS failed: Bad address

This messes up guest state for the CMMA values (guest data corruption)

This is fixed with

    s390x: fix storage attributes migration for non-small guests
    
    Fix storage attribute migration so that it does not fail for guests
    with more than a few GB of RAM.
    With such guests, the index in the buffer would go out of bounds,
    usually by large amounts, thus receiving -EFAULT from the kernel.
    Migration itself would be successful, but storage attributes would then
    not be migrated completely.
    
    This patch fixes the out of bounds access, and thus migration of all
    storage attributes when the guest have large amounts of memory.

This fix is part of 2.11.1 so the qemu in bionic is fine.
The qemu in artful, as well as the qemu in the cloud archives for 16.04 need this fix, so we have
affected qemus in 17.10 and 16.04. 

Regarding 16.04:
The bug only triggers for host kernels >= 4.13 - in other words when you combine HWE kernel with the qemu from the cloud archive.

As discussed on IRC, this isn't important for the last week of Artful before EOL.
But it is for the Cloud Archives longer time I'd think.

So I added a UCA task for them to take a look.

Hello Christian and Frank,

I'm working on backporting this to Pike and will update the bug with more details soon.

Thanks,
