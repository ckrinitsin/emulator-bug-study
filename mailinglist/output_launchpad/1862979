Cannot Create Socket Networking in Windows Host using Multicast

Hello QEMU devs,

I am trying to create a simulated VLAN using socket networking, and the only way to connect multiple networks in QEMU using socket networking is by using the multicast `mcast` option of the `socket` network backend.

However, when I try use the following arguments in QEMU to create a multicast socket network:

`-device e1000,id=sock-0 -netdev id=sock-0,mcast=230.0.0.1:1234`

it fails with:

`can't bind ip address=230.0.0.1: unknown error` in my Windows host.

I would like to know if this is a bug, or if I am missing a prerequisite before running the QEMU command.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
