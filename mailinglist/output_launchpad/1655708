target/ppc/int_helper.c:2806: strange expression ?

target/ppc/int_helper.c:2806:25: warning: ‘*’ in boolean context, suggest ‘&&’ instead [-Wint-in-bool-context]

Source code is

       zone_digit = (i * 2) ? b->u8[BCD_DIG_BYTE(i * 2)] >> 4 : zone_lead;

Which I read as

       zone_digit = (i * 2) ? (b->u8[BCD_DIG_BYTE(i * 2)] >> 4) : zone_lead;

so I think the compiler warning is for the i * 2 lhs of the ?.

I am not sure what to suggest as a bugfix.

Also, looking at BCD_DIG_BYTE():

#if defined(HOST_WORDS_BIGENDIAN)
#define BCD_DIG_BYTE(n) (15 - (n/2))
#else
#define BCD_DIG_BYTE(n) (n/2)
#endif

Oops. n is under-parenthesized, and will cause invalid expansions for
some expressions.  Let's fix that as well.

Yes - the compiler is complaining that 'i * 2' can only be non-zero if
'i' was non-zero (given that the code occurs in a loop for i between 0
and 16), so it is just as easy to write 'i ? ...' instead of the weirder
'(i * 2) ? ...'.

I suspect it is just possible that the i * 2 expression is a typo
for something else, perhaps i & 2 or i << 2 or i >> 2 or something else.

I don't know the code so I am unable to offer better guidance.
