scrolling does not work once mouse is grabbed

The title pretty much told it all. It occurs in Windows 10 RS1 on qemu 2.7.0. Interestingly, I can scroll in the guest if the mouse is not grabbed. So using usb-tablet sort of works around it, but if I explicitly grab the mouse with Ctrl+Alt+G, scrolling will also stop working.

The host is Arch Linux so the qemu build uses gtk(3) for GUI by default. I wanted to test with sdl but it seems sdl support in qemu is sort of broken that I can't even start the virtual machine properly with that.

Full commands I used:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cpu host -smp cores=4 -m 4G -drive file=test.img,format=raw

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cpu host -smp cores=4 -m 4G -drive file=test.img,format=raw -device nec-usb-xhci -device usb-kbd -device usb-mouse

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cpu host -smp cores=4 -m 4G -drive file=test.img,format=raw -device nec-usb-xhci -device usb-kbd -device usb-tablet

Not sure if it is relevant, but there's a HID button device cannot get started in Windows 10 RS1.

I am also having trouble with this bug. I have QEMU version 2.11.1 on kubuntu. I have the same symptoms as above, and would be willing to assist in troubleshooting. The mouse I am using has two side buttons for forward and back on web-browsing and a scroll wheel with scroll button. I am using QEMU/KVM through Virtual Machine Manager.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
