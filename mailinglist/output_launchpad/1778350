Android-x86 4.4-r5 won't boot on QEMU since v2.11.0-rc2

Try to boot from the Android-x86 4.4-r5 ISO won't boot in QEMU after 2.11.0-rc2. The last known version it works is 2.11.0-rc1.
It also works on the 2.10.x-line, even the 2.10.2 which was released after 2.11.0-rc2!

How to reproduce:
Download the ISO from
http://www.android-x86.org/releases/releasenote-4-4-r5 or directly https://www.fosshub.com/Android-x86.html/android-x86-4.4-r5.iso

Start QEMU with this command-line: qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom android-x86-4.4-r5.iso -m 1024

On 2.11.0-rc1 and 2.10.2 after selecting to boot from CD it shows the Android splash after a short while ...
On 2.11.0-rc2 through the latest 2.12 line it goes to black screen shortly right after selecting to boot from CD

After 'git bisect' -ing it I found the commit that is responsible for this:

Can you pls try to set x-pci-hole64-fix=off and see whether that helps?

I don't know if there is another way to do that but I changed the properties of x-pci-hole64-fix in hw/pci-host/piix.c and hw/pci-host/q35.c to false on current master and compiled and now it works again. 

Maybe you can add a switch (unless there already is one) so one can change it on runtime without compiling?

Nevermind that, just found out how to run:

qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom android-x86-4.4-r5.iso -m 1024 -global i440FX-pcihost.x-pci-hole64-fix=off -global q35-pcihost.x-pci-hole64-fix=off



I looked at it and while I might be wrong, I suspect
it's a bug in ACPI parser in that version of Linux.
Is there a way for you to try a later Linux version?
Alternatively, I tried to build 4.4-rc2 on Fedora and couldn't.

I compiled the 4.4.4-r5 branch but I was not able to change the kernel yet.

Furthermore I am not able to use any version of Android x86 6.x, 7.x, 8.x on current QEMU with or without the parameters. 

@navicrej -- can you please apply the series

[Qemu-devel] [PATCH 0/2] hw/pci-host/x86: extend the 64-bit PCI hole relative to the fw-assigned base
https://<email address hidden>/

on your end, and see if it makes a difference?

(I don't expect it to, for the reason I described in <http://<email address hidden>>.)

Thanks!

No feedback for almost two years, closing.
