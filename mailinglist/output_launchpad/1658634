Can't get correct display with latest QEMU and OVMF BIOS

I tried to install a Ubuntu 16.04.1 Desktop 64bits with latest QEMU and OVMF UEFI BIOS, however I can't get correct display output with default vga configuration (-vga std). However, qemu works with a couple of different configurations:
1. "-vga cirrus" + "-bios OVMF.fd": works
2. "-vga std" + non-UEFI bios: works

The same error with QEMU 2.8.0 release. Everything works well on 2.7.0/1.

(1) What phase of the guest do you get invalid video output in? Do you see the TianoCore splash screen? Does the grub2 menu appear?

(2) I cannot reproduce the issue (with a different guest OS anyway); I just tried QEMU (at d1c82f7cc344) and OVMF (built from edk2 at 7cf59c854f35), with stdvga; this combo works fine.

(3) Can you bisect QEMU from 2.7 through 2.8, using the same OVMF binary?

(4) Side point: please *never* use "-bios OVMF.fd"; use two pflash chips instead. Libvirt (strongly recommended) will do this for you.

Thanks.

Splash screen and UEFI shell were displayed correctly. Grub2 menu and
Ubuntu login screen also appeared, however the display didn't seem right. I
got very blurry output.

With QEMU 2.7.0 and the same OVMF.fd, everything works well.

Please let me know if anything is not clear.

Thanks,
Kai

I downloaded "ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso" (MD5: 17643c29e3c4609818f26becf76d29a3), and I can reproduce the issue -- the grub2 display is corrupt. (I didn't even look further than that.) I also confirm that it works fine with the same firmware, but using QEMU 2.7.

Here's the result of the bisection:

    console: skip same-size resize
    
    virtio-gpu does a set-scanout at each frame (it might be a driver
    regression). qemu_console_resize() recreate a surface even if the size
    didn't change, and this shows up in profiling reports because the
    surface is cleared. With this patch, I get a +15-20% glmark2
    improvement.

If I revert this commit on top of current master -- it reverts cleanly -- then the grub2 screen displays fine again.

For reference, this is my script:

Only skip surface reallocation in case the old surface was created using
qemu_alloc_display (via qemu_create_displaysurface) too, otherwise we
might end up with a DisplaySurface with the wrong backing storage.

Good catch.  /me wonders why gcc didn't throw a warning on that one.

Fixed.

It works well on my side with the patch. Thanks!

qemu_alloc_display (via qemu_create_displaysurface) too, otherwise we
might end up with a DisplaySurface with the wrong backing storage.
