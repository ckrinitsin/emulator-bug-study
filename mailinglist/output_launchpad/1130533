Documentation cannot be build since commit c70a01e449536c616c85ab820c6fbad7d7e9cf39

I tried to build git -based qemu and when documentation is processed I got this error :

./qemu-options.texi:1526: unknown command `list'
./qemu-options.texi:1526: table requires an argument: the formatter for @item
./qemu-options.texi:1526: warning: @table has text but no @item

Looks like commit c70a01e449536c616c85ab820c6fbad7d7e9cf39 is guilty ?!

Or any modification related to documentation, I think.

I'm using Archlinux and I'm trying to install any qemu-* package from AUR currently. It doesn't work and reverting the mentioned patch doesn't fix it:
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=c70a01e449536c616c85ab820c6fbad7d7e9cf39;hp=6265c43b0c872015e4331d3a93ff99946f3edb01

Rationale:
I'm compling while writting this, but it looks to me that the new version of texinfo 5.0 (rewritten in Perl) trigged this bug. I'm not sure who to blaim. Maybe it a mistake in qemu, undefined behaviour of texinfo 4.0 or a bug in the new 5.0 release of texinfo.

*totally impartial rant without good reason*
Good old C-Code fixes it!

I vote a mistake in qemu patch. I was able to build qemu-git (I own the package qemu-git on AUR) with texinfo 5.0 before the documentation patch was added.

Could be also a bug related to texinfo 5.0 upgrade, indeed !

Anyway, besides removing this patch, which are the options ?

Please try this patch:
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/222212/

Tried it. You can add it, it works !

Patch is ok, with this little warning when applied. Nothing really bad.

patching file qemu-options.hx
Hunk #1 succeeded at 2097 (offset 2 lines).

git head is : http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=73d4dc71f3a41131541c73b3ac2a8b160a51842b

Besides this,  it builds perfectly.

Any hope to get it upstream ? 

Thanks !

Yes, it will get merged.


This should have been fixed by this commit here:
