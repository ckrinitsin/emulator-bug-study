driftfix=none and migration on Win7 guest causes time to go 10 times as fast

With -rtc base=localtime,clock=host,driftfix=none on a Win7 guest, stopping it with migration and then starting it again about 1 hour later makes the guest time go 10 times as fast as real time until Windows is rebooted.  I have tried qith qemu-2.0.0 and the problem still exists there.

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

I am unable to reproduce this with qemu 2.11.0

OK, thanks for checking again! So I'm closing this ticket now.
