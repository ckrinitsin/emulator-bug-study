This is fixed in upstream QEMU in commit 75e5b70e6b5dcc, which is in
QEMU 2.12.0. If Ubuntu are interested in fixing this they can backport
that to the QEMU they are shipping, or alternatively move forward to 2.12.

This was already fixed in bionic's 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu4, and the current version of the package in bionic is 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.5.

I just tried a build in bionic and it finished just fine.

Looking at the tmp directory of your build, you seem to be using an older version:
/tmp/qemu-2.10+dfsg/util/memfd.c:40:12: error: static......

I will therefore mark this bug as invalid. If you believe that to be a mistake, please reopen it with further information.

Thanks!
