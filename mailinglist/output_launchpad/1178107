qemu-system-*.exe -cpu ? (or -M ?) exit silently

For example, 'qemu-system-arm -cpu ?' on Linux host give me available cpu list:

Available CPUs:
  arm1026
  arm1136
  arm1136-r2
  ...

But on Windows host, I got nothing:

C:\opt\qemu-1.5.0-rc0-win64>qemu-system-arm -cpu ?

C:\opt\qemu-1.5.0-rc0-win64>echo %ERRORLEVEL%
0

Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU?

This usually means that mingw(?) has been configured such that stdout/stderr from a program goes to a text file in the current working directory rather than to the console.


OK, so this is not a bug, but a feature of MiNGW (or SDL? ... now that you've mentioned it, I remember there was something similar in libSDL on Windows), thus let's close this ticket.
