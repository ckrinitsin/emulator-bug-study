pci-stub.o: In function `do_pci_info':0.14.0 compile problem

Please see this build log. I didn't compile thq qemu-kvm on Mandriva Cooker and haven't any idea. I'm the qemu maintainer on Mandriva.



QEMU 0.14.0 is quite outdated - and I assume that compilation is working fine again with the latest version, so I'm closing this bug ticket now. If you still have problems with the latest version of QEMU, feel free to open it again (or create a new bug ticket instead).
