Android-x86_64 guest - "Could not disable RealTimeClock events (20160831/evxfevnt-267)"; UI sluggish, ACPI doesn't work with QEMU 2.10.0

I'm running a custom-built Android-x86_64 guest in an Arch Linux host with the 4.12.10 kernel.

Following the latest Arch Linux upgrade to QEMU 2.10.0-1, upon booting the virtual machine, I get the error mentioned in the title. Afterwards, the virtual machine becomes slower and slower. The ACPI functions (the libvirt's Shutdown button, for example) don't work.

When I downgrade to QEMU 2.9.0-3 everything works fine once again.

This is maybe a duplicate of https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1714331 ... could you please try a newer version of the OVMF firmware (if you're using it)?

It works with a newer OVMF version!

Thank you.
