[Feature request] qemu-img image conversion does not show percentage

It will be nice if qemu-img will be able to show percentage of completition and average speed of conversion and compress ratio (if converting to compressed qcow or qcow2)

qemu-img convert -p does show a percentage completion (but not avg speed or compression ratio) so this is at least partially done.

Incomplete patch.

Usecase: `qemu-img convert` with -p now shows the write speed.

1. I'm calculating the speed using the time taken to run the for(;;)
at qemu-img.c:1477. I figured that every time this loop runs, n1
sectors are converted, and so I calculate the write_speed
accordingly. Is this correct?

2. I have changed qemu-progress.c:qemu_progress_print() to take in a
speed parameter, thinking that it would be the best option. Should I
do it some other way instead (maybe write another function to print
just speed)?

Patches attached on the bug tracker are not reviewed, they should be
sent to the qemu-devel mailing list instead.

If you want to link to a submitted patch from launchpad, please post a
mailing list archive link.  For example:

Progress printing had been added here:
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/6b837bc4a4d
So I think it should be fine to close this ticket now.
