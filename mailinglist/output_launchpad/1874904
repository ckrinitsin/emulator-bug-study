qemu windows with gtk and french keypad not working as expected

When I use qemu on Windows 10 with a French AZERTY keypad with the correct options the emulated system keypad still QWERTY. If we use sdl it works fine the emulated keypad is AZERTY.

Example of command with ubuntu live cd:
-> qemu-system-x86_64.exe  -m 4G ubuntu-18.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso -display gtk -k fr

NOTES:
 - Using the same command on Linux works fine. The emulated keypad is AZERTY.

Qemu version : 4.2.0 on Windows 10

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
