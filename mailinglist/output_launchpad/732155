system_reset doesn't work with qemu-kvm and latest SeaBIOS

I've built qemu-kvm and seabios from the latest git sources, and found that the system_reset monitor command causes a freeze if I start qemu-system-x86_64 with the -no-kvm flag.  This is a serial log from an attempt at rebooting:

$ ./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -monitor stdio -bios ../seabios/out/bios.bin -serial /dev/stdout -no-kvm

I've tried fiddling a few build options in SeaBIOS but I'm not sure that's where the issue lies.  The RESET REQUESTED is me adding some extra debug to vl.c:1477 in the clause that tests for a reset request, and the i8042: lines are debug lines from seabios tracing the execution of the reset request.

This may be a bug in SeaBIOS of course, since I can replicate the behaviour on my distro's qemu and kvm packages.  However it seems odd that qemu behaves differently with KVM turned on (i.e. system_reset works) than with it disabled.

A bit of bisection on SeaBIOS shows that commit 244caf86f11f5f65d166d91704f64cb673167abc was the first to exhibit this behaviour.  Arguably a SeaBIOS bug, but I don't know enough about the reset process to judge.

This patch to SeaBIOS seems to fix it, but I still think there's a bug in kvm if it behaves differently with or without the "-no-kvm" flag.

qemu 0.12 and newer reboot of FreeBSD (m0n0wall.vmdk http://m0n0.ch/wall/ ) fails. 
The Server (IBM xSeries 206), on which i found this "problem", has no kvm support... 
finally i decided not to use the IBM server [it is awfully slow when booting, although ubuntu server is really fast available ;-))...but sometimes fails to boot...so i don't use it for production].

I ran several tests and here is my expierence when trying to run m0n0wall.vmdk in qemu:
   everything works fine: system starts and can be configured...
BUT, when I tell the system to reboot, it shuts down only until the message rebooting appears...nothing more happens...
   i can kill the Vmachine and restart it from commandline, but this is not very handy...

it worked in qemu 0.9 and BOCHS Bios

it always works with kvm: i need to start it as root (sudo kvm), otherwise it also won't reboot.

I tested it with several versions on servers, with kvm-support: 
- Ubuntu 10.04 server 32 bit
- Ubuntu 10.04 server 64 bit
- Suse 11.4 32 bit

-seabios 0.5: reboot worked with kvm, but didn't work with qemu (without kvm support)
-seabios 0.6: reboot worked with kvm, but didn't work with qemu (without kvm support)

Hope it helps somebody!

Sounds like this could have been a duplicate bug of https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/643430 ? If so, it should have been fixed in late 2011. Could you check with the latest version of QEMU / Seabios if the problem still persists?

Hi Thomas, thanks for the triage.  I'm a few years past working on this project directly so if it's not affecting anyone else I'd probably just close this bug.

OK, thanks for your response! So let's assume it's the same bug as 643430, i.e. it should be fixed nowadays.
