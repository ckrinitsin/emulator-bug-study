[Feature Request] add usbredir device reset blacklist options support to allow macOS guest to iOS device usbredir

Description of problem:
Currently, when a iOS device is redirected to a macOS VM, it falls into a reset-not-found loop.
Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
latest
How reproducible:
100%
Steps to Reproduce:


Connect an iOS device to Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (I believe it is the same for any distro.)


Connect virt-manager/virt-viewer to a macOS VM through SPICE (I am using OSX 10.15 Catalina)


Attempt to redirect the iOS device (iPad in my case) to the VM through usb redirection.


Actual results:
For any odd number of attempt, the guest macOS will send a reset to the iOS device which causes the host to reset the USB connection in the host side. In the UI, it will be displayed as a successful connection for a few seconds before it disconnects. After this, the iOS device will reconnect itself, but via a different device name /dev/bus/usb/x/y+1.
For any even number of attempt, when I select the iOS device in the virt-manager/virt-viewer UI, the connection will not success and instead a LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_FOUND error will be provided. Then the UI will reload and get the new device name of the iOS device, falling into the behavior of the aforementioned odd number of attempt.
Expected results:
The macOS detects the iOS device and connects to it happily.
Additional info:
It seems that this bug has been first identified as in https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100149, for a Samsung Android device, which the developers of SPICE applied a hotfix in https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/usbredir/-/blob/master/usbredirhost/usbredirhost.c#L147. However, there were no settings available for users to fix it.
A similar bug that also consists of a macOS guest/iOS device pair, but instead of being usbredir, is usb-host, has been identified and patched in https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/ba4c735b4fc74e309ce4b2551d258e442ef513a5, which is further modified into https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blame/146aa0f104bb3bf88e43c4082a0bfc4bbda4fbd8/hw/usb/host-libusb.c#L1486. Following such patch, I have attempted to apply such patch at host-side in https://github.com/michaellee8/qemu/blob/master/hw/usb/redirect.c (not correctly formatted currently, pls ignore it atm), however I discovered that this is not enough since it is also a SPICE issue, which resolves to virt-manager/virt-viewer.
This is probably a cross-project issue between qemu, spice (usbredir) and virt-manager/virt-viewer, which would some effort to coordinate a solution. However a working solution for this problem would probably benefits a lot of users whom relies on connecting a mobile device into a VM, for purposes like easier mobile development. Considering the report for the Samsung Android Device on a PC use case, such issue is probably cross-OS/cross-device.

The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
