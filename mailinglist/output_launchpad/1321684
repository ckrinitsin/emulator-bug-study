block_stream command stalls

block_stream command stalls near finishing.
I tried 1.7.1, 2.0.0 and the master versions. All of them stalled.
But the 1.1.2 could finish the job.

Here is how to reproduce it:

$ sudo $QEMU \
-enable-kvm  -cpu qemu64  -m 1024  \
-monitor stdio \
-drive file=./i1,if=none,id=drive_0,cache=none,aio=native -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=drive_0,bus=pci.0,addr=0x5 \

Can you still reproduce this on qemu.git/master?

$ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1024 -cpu host -drive if=virtio,cache=none,file=test.img,id=drive_1

To Stefan:  

yes, I can reproduce this on qemu.git/master.  

Actually, I've found the cause of this bug and sent a patch to qemu-devel mailing list a few days ago: 
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2014-05/msg05777.html

It's very kind of you helping review the patch and give some comments.

Thanks. 

Cong Meng. 

Triaging old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
