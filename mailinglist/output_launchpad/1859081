Mouse way too fast when Qemu is on a Windows VM with a OS 9 Guest

On a server, I have a Windows 10 VM with Qemu 4.1.0 (latest) from https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/ installed.
There I have a Mac OS 9.2.2 machine.
Now if I connect to the Windows VM with VNC or RDP or even VMWare console, the Mouse in the Mac OS Guest inside Qemu is waaaay to fast. Even when lowering the mouse speed in the Mac OS mouse setting, one pixel in the Host (Windows 10 VM) still moves the mouse by 10 pixels inside the Qemu machine.
I tried different resolutions but that does not help.
Is there any way to fix this or any way how I can provide more information?
Thanks

What is the QEMU command-line you use?
Does this problem exist with the usb mouse (-device usb-mouse)?
Could you try upgrading to the latest version of QEMU and see if the issue is resolved please?

The command line I currently use is:

".\qemu-4.2.0-win64\qemu-system-ppc.exe" -L pc-bios -boot c -M mac99,via=pmu -m 512 ^
-prom-env "auto-boot?=true" -prom-env "boot-args=-v" -prom-env "vga-ndrv?=true" ^
-drive file=c:\qemu\MacOS9.2.img,format=raw,media=disk ^
-drive file=c:\qemu\MacOS9.2.2_Universal_Install.iso,format=raw,media=cdrom ^
-sdl ^
-netdev user,id=network01 -device sungem,netdev=network01 ^
-device VGA,edid=on

I also tried by adding "-device usb-mouse" but it does not make any difference.
I now tried with 4.2.0 from omledom (yesterday with 4.1.0 from weilnetz.
There is no difference in 4.1.0 and 4.2.0 with or without the usb-mouse.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
