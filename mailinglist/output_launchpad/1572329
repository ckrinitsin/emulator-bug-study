ARM bootloader does not set r0 to 0

# arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm -M raspi2 -m 1024 -smp 4 -kernel kernel.bin -serial stdio -dtb rpi2.dtb

My code shows r0 = 0x31 while it should be 0.

Hi. Thanks for this bug report and the patch. In order
for us to be able to use your patch, we'll need you to
provide a signed-off-by line, which tells us you have
the legal right to submit it and are happy for us to
include it in QEMU under QEMU's licensing terms.
(You can look at
http://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch#Patch_emails_must_include_a_Signed-off-by:_line
if you want more details.)

You can provide a signoff just by replying to this email
with a line which reads
"Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@here>".

A couple of notes: this bug only affects boards which
have a write_board_setup function, which means only
highbank/midway, raspi2, and xilinx_zynq; that's probably
why we didn't spot it earlier.

thanks
-- PMM
