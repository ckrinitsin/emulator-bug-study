support horisontal mouse wheel

Brad Jorsch provided a series of patches to support horisontal mouse scrolling in qemu-emulated mouse.
See Debian bug#579968 -- http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=579968 and submission to qemu-devel list at http://<email address hidden>/msg30991.html .


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
