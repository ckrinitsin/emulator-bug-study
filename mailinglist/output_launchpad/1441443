Is there a way to create a 10G network interface for VMs in KVM2.0?



We have installed & configured the KVM 2.0 (qemu-kvm 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.10) on Ubuntu 14.04. The physical server is connected to 10G network, KVM is configured in Bridged mode But the issue is, when we create Network interface on VMs, we have only 1G device as an options for vmhosts. Is this the limit of the KVM or is there a way to create a 10G network interface for VMs? Available device models

E1000
Ne2k_pci
Pcnet
Rtl8139
virtio

Please find the network configuration details

Source device : Host device vnet1 (Bridge ‘br0’)
Device model : virtio 

Network configuration in the host /etc/network/interfaces

auto br0
iface br0 inet static
        address 10.221.x.10
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 10.221.x.0
        broadcast 10.221.x.255
        gateway 10.221.x.1
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-nameservers X.X.X.X

Looking through old bug tickets ... have you already tried to use vhost-net? That should be one of the fastest ways of networking with QEMU as far as I know...

Unless you are using SRIOV or DPDK which both need hardware support. If could support SRIOV, then using IOMMU+VFIO, and pass-through to VM, this will get a close number. Or DPDK, using a user-space driver + vhost-net, will also get a pretty good value.
