IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL MSR unset for nested virtualization

I enabled nested virtualization for the kvm_intel module, and passed -enable-kvm and -cpu host to qemu. However, the qemu BIOS did not set IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL MSR (index 0x3a) to a non-zero value allow VMXON. According to the Intel manual Section 23.7 ENABLING AND ENTERING VMX OPERATION: "To enable VMX support in a platform, BIOS must set bit 1, bit 2, or both (see below), as well as the lock bit."

I noticed an old mailing list thread on this (https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2015-01/msg01372.html), but I wanted to point out that the Intel manual (and all the physical hardware I've tested) specifically contradicts this response.

Tested on kernel 4.3.3 and qemu 2.4.1.

Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?
