qemu can't start Windows10arm64 19H1(with kvm)

My cpu's model is arm64(cortex-a53),I want start Win10arm64 with kvm,Because is fast than x86.But it's did'nt work.The screnn is card in Uefi's logo. But I am use ramfb now,So it has nothing to do with the graphics card.But if I discard kvm,It can start now.But its so slowly.But I use the uefi and kvm can start with Debian arm64 buster. So who's the problem?qemu or kvm or Microsoft?But others use it to start successfully. I don't know what I would like to do
This is start command(Qemu version is 4.1')
qemu-system-aarch64 -hda /win10.vhdx -cdrom /win10arm.iso -m 1G -accel kvm -smp 4 -cpu host -pflash efi.img -pflash var.img -device ramfb -device qemu-xhci -device usb-kbd -device usb-mouse -device usb-tablet
If I replace the above three parameters with "- CPU cortex-a53" and "- accel TCG" and "- device VGA", I can start normally. What's the matter?

What is your host machine? And could you please try with the latest version of QEMU (v5.0)?

I try use latest qemu，but It was the same

And I am try Windows 10 build 19613，but was cant not start，too(sorry，My english It's not well)

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
