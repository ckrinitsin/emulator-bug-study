mips binaries segfault

Hello World appears to segfault with qemu mips, on a Debian 10.0.0 Buster amd64 host.

Example:


$ cat mips/test/hello.cpp 
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
    return 0;
}

$ mips-linux-gnu-g++ -o hello hello.cpp && ./hello
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped

Note that 64-bit MIPS and little endian 32-bit MIPS qemu work fine. The problem is limited to big endian 32-bit MIPS.

Could you attach the version of g++ and qemu? In other words, can you capture the output of:

mips-linux-gnu-g++ --version

and

qemu-mips --version

?

Does the problem happen if you compile with "-static" option?

Does the problem exist using c hello world and gcc?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
