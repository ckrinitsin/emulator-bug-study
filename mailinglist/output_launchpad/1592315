Windows 10 continuous screen refresh if resize guest to match window size is selected with QXL

When VDA-Agent starts up, I get a continuous flicker of the screen. This is almost like a screen refresh, where I am not even able to really click on things and/or open menus.

Running Windows 10, x64

Some additional interesting things I've observed:

* If the QXL driver is not installed, then the flicker doesn't happen
* As soon as i enable the VDA Agent, the annoying flicker / screen refresh begins
* When I disable the VDA Agent, same thing happens.

- I tried Windows-Guest-Tools-0.100 and version 0.0103-r1

- And an assortment of QXL drivers, (WDM, proper for Windows 10).


As a workaround, I can set "Scale display" to On, and "Resize Guest to Match" to off (using Spicy-gtk). This stops the flicker.

- Another strange thing is that I my XQL driver in Windows shows 8GB of Video mem. I am not sure how/why this is, as I have not seen this before.

Please refer to the following tickets:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1266484

I can't deduce from the above whether it is a host side problem (spice-gtk) or a problem with the VDAgent (= guest code, Windows and Linux), but it's certainly not a QEMU bug. Closing.
