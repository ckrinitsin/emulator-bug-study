multiboot header has 0 in mem_upper field

When booting a multiboot image,. mem_upper is now always zero.

To test, build qemu from current git head, then do
  cd tests/multiboot
  ./run_test.sh

You will see the test fail.  In each case mem_upper is 0k.

git-bisect says the bad commit is 0169c511554cb0014a00290b0d3d26c31a49818f in qemu.git

This change fixes it.

I don't know why this fixes the issue.  Hence, no signed-off-by line, etc.

My guess is that the memset zeros something it shouldn't off the end of
the array (but that doesn't make sense to me!)

tests/multiboot seems to work with current git again, so I assume this issue has been fixed? Or is there something left to do?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
