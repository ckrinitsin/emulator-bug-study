qemu window hides in the background on osx

When launching qemu on OSX (10.8.5), the window comes up in the background.  A bit of googling shows that the addition of [NSApp activateIgnoringOtherApps:YES]; before the [NSApp run]; in main fixes this.

Looks like such a line has been added with this commit here:
http://git.qemu-project.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=43227af88a36faed
Is the latest version of QEMU now working as expected?

This seems to only affect fullscreen mode, so if that's the case, I don't see it as resolved.
