I would rephrase to:

-------------------------------

Under KVM recommendations

PCI passthrough recommendations

If you are running PCI passthrough with 16.04.x KVM and with the stock QEMU package, update to the QEMU package that have DDW support. If you do not update the package, you will hit data integrity issues as soon as I/O is started on the adapter.

The package is available at: https://launchpad.net/~ibmpackages/+archive/ubuntu/ddw

Some time ago DDW was discussed in this ticket:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+bug/1541902
And it got introduced in Yakkety and higher only.
Due to pretty complex changes and changes in the virtual machine attributes there is no plan to get it into xenial.
Also 'bugproxy' changed "targetmilestone-inin16041" to "targetmilestone-inin1610".
We are wondering why this now came up again?
