Any specific information on what the guest was doing?  Was it doing
heavy I/O or was it idle?

Are you using IDE emulation or virtio-blk?

Please provide a backtrace:
1. Build with ./configure --disable-strip (or use matching -debuginfo
packages from your distro)
2. Run with gdb --args path/to/qemu [...args...]

When the abort happens please use the "bt" GDB command to display a backtrace.
