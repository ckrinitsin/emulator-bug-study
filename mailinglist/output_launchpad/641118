NetBSD guest only supports network without ACPI

Git commit: abdfd9500e07fab7d6ffd4385fa30a065c329a39
Host: Linux 64bit Debian
Guest: NetBSD5.0.2/i386

Networking works only when ACPI is disabled in the guest. Without it the network card (wm0) is not detected.

Boot: qemu -hda netbsd5.0.2-i386 -boot c -enable-kvm
Configure: --enable-linux-aio --enable-io-thread --enable-kvm

Can you still reproduce this problem with the latest version of QEMU, or can we close this ticket nowadays?

I've just tried, and it is OK using NetBSD7 as the guest.  I no longer have NetBSD5 so I am unable to check if the problem still exists on that.

OK, thanks for checking! ... so let's close this bug.
