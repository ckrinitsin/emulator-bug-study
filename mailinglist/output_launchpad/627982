linux 2.6.35 hangs with -no-acpi

Linux 2.6.35 hangs at boot when giving -no-acpi to qemu, for instance the Debian kernel:

qemu -no-acpi -kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.35-trunk-686 

There is no output except just "Booting the kernel"

Is this a kernel regression?  A qemu regression?  What do 'info 
registers' and 'x/20i $eip' show?

You know better than this.

I have a truly marvellous patch that fixes the bug which this
signature is too narrow to contain.


Since kernel 2.6.35 is pretty much outdated nowadays, I think we can close this bug now (Feel free to re-open it if necessary).
