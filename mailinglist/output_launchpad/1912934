QEMU emulation of fmadds instruction on powerpc64le is buggy

The attached program test-fmadds.c tests the fmadds instruction on powerpc64le.

Result on real hardware (POWER8E processor):
$ ./a.out ; echo $?
0

Result in Alpine Linux 3.13/powerpcle, emulated by QEMU 5.0.0 on Ubuntu 16.04:
$ ./a.out ; echo $?
32

Result in Debian 8.6.0/ppc64el, emulated by QEMU 2.9.0 on Ubuntu 16.04:
$ ./a.out ; echo $?
32

Through 'nm --dynamic qemu-system-ppc64 | grep fma' I can see that QEMU is NOT using the fmaf() or fma() function from the host system's libc; this function is working fine in glibc of the host system (see https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/fmaf.html ).



The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


The situation is still the same in QEMU 6.0.0.

$ powerpc64le-linux-gnu-gcc-5 test-fmadds.c -static
$ ~/inst-qemu/6.0.0/bin/qemu-ppc64le ./a.out ; echo $?
32



This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
