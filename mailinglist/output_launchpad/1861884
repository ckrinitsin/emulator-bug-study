qemu socket multicast not working

Running two qemu vms on the same socket multicast address:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -smp 2 -serial mon:stdio -display none -vga none
    -nodefaults -accel hax
    -netdev user,id=mynet0
    -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=mynet0
    -netdev socket,id=vlan,mcast=239.192.0.1:1235
    -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=vlan
    -device virtio-rng-pci
    -drive file=worker.qcow2,if=virtio
    -drive file=cloud-init.iso,format=raw,if=virtio

The two machines have a static ip on the socket network interface, 192.168.100.11 and 192.168.100.12, but are unable to reach each other. 

Is there additional configuration necessary on macos? Does this only work on Linux?

guest OS: Debian 10 (Buster)
host OS: macOS 10.15.2
qemu: 4.2.0

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
