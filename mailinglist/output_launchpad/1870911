QEMU Crashes on Launch, Windows

Hi,

I an having no issues up to (and including) v5.0.0-rc0, but when I move to rc1 ... it won't even execute in Windows. If I just try to, for example, run

qemu-system-x86_64.exe --version

No output, it just exits. This seems to be new with this version.

Thanks!

Happens to me too with qemu-system-ppc. Earlier thread is here:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2020-04/msg00027.html

For now compiling with --disable-pie will produce a running executable.

Best,
Howard


Thanks for the pointer! Yep, same here - if I --disable-pie, rebuild and try again => now no crash, at least checking --version ;-).

Will continue testing here, report back if I see any other oddities.

Thanks again.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
