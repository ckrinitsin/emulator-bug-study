Mouse cursor sometimes can't pass the invisible border on the right side of the screen

I'm using qemu 2.11 on Gentoo Linux, with configured GPU passthrough (Radeon RX580) to the guest Windows 10.
This configuration is alive for last 4 years, this time I changed a lot qemu, linux kernel and windows versions, changed GPU and always all was working as expected. I always used standard PS/2 mouse emulation and that was enough for me.

Now, I bought two new monitors, instead of old one, and setup them as one logical monitor, using technology called Eyefinity - it's a part of standard Radeon software. Now Windows thinks, that I have one monitor with resolution 2160x1920 (I bought Dell monitors with a thin borders and use them in portrait mode).

Windows uses it without any problems, but mouse become crazy - sometimes (~3 times from each 5) I can't move cursor to the right border of the screen, it looks like the invisible vertical border. I spent really huge amount of time to understand, which component is the root of problem and found, that it's really a mouse. I tried all possible variants (standard, tablet, virtio-mouse-pci, virtio-tablet-pci), and found, that in both mouse variants bug is reproducing, and in both tablet variants - cursor stuck near all real borders and corners, so it's not a variant too.
The only working variant becomes passing real USB port to my VM and insert second mouse to this port. So, now it's working, but I have two mice on my working place, which doesn't seems very useful.

Here is my command line:

QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=pa QEMU_PA_SAMPLES=4096 qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -M q35 -m 12168 -cpu host,kvm=off -smp 4,sockets=1,cores=4 \

-usb -usbdevice host:046d:c52b

All in all, I checked on Windows 7 and Windows 10, and on qemu 2.10 and 2.11 - bug is always reproducible.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'expired' now.
