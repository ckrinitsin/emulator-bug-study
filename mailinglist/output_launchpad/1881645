qemu-system-x86_64 --help (or --version) gives no output

I have Arch Linux with qemu 5.0.0-6 (seen with pacman). Running VMs work just fine, but when I run qemu-system-x86_64 --version or qemu-system-x86_64 --help, there is no feedback on the screen. This behavior messes up other applications (GNS3 in my case that cannot recognize qemu as correctly installed because there is no feedback.
My kernel is 5.6.11.

Can you reproduce this problem with the latest upstream version of QEMU, too (currently v6.0)? Otherwise it might be a bug in the version from your distribution, in that case please report it in the bug tracker of your distro instead.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
