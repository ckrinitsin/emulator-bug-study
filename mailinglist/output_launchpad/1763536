go build fails under qemu-ppc64le-static (qemu-user)

I am using qemu-user (built static) in a docker container environment.  When running multi-threaded go commands in the container (go build for example) the process may hang, report segfaults or other errors.  I built qemu-ppc64le from the upstream git (master).

I see the problem running on a multi core system with Intel i7 processors.
# cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name"
model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz

Steps to reproduce:
1) Build qemu-ppc64le as static and copy into docker build directory named it qemu-ppc64le-static.

2) Add hello.go to docker build dir.

package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello world")
}

3) Create the Dockerfile from below:

FROM ppc64le/golang:1.10.1-alpine3.
COPY qemu-ppc64le-static /usr/bin/
COPY hello.go /go

4) Build container
$ docker build -t qemutest -f Dockerfile ./go 

5) Run test
$ docker run -it qemutest

Note the results may differ between attempts,  hangs and other faults sometimes happen.

If I run "go: single threaded I don't see the problem, for example:

/go # GOMAXPROCS=1 go build -p 1 hello.go 
/go # ./hello
hello world

I see the same issue with arm64.  I don't think this is a go issue, but don't have a real evidence to prove that.  This problem looks similar to other problem I have seen reported against qemu running multi-threaded applications.

I missed a step for reproduction.  Step 1 should be:
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register
This modprobes binfmt and registers qemu-ppc64le-static as the interpreter for ppc64le executables.

FYI: To workaround this issue you can limit the docker container to a single cpu like this:

docker run --cpuset-cpus 0 -it cross-test3 go build hello.go

This works for docker build as well.

docker build--cpuset-cpus 0 .....

Do you have a simpler repro case (ie one that doesn't require docker) ?


I will attempt to find an way to re-create without docker.  The key is we need a way to create a ppc64le (or arm64) fakeroot with go that we can chroot into.  That is easy to do with docker.  BTW: the use case using docker and qemu-user-static is becoming fairly common way to cross build container images.

I care more about the arm64 case, so if you're going to do one then that would be my preference.


Using QEMU from tag v2.12.0-rc4 on Ubuntu Xenial ppc64el, it works.

muriloo@jaspion1:~/go-docker$ sudo docker run --rm -it qemutest
/go # /usr/bin/qemu-ppc64le-static --version

/go #

Here is how I configured QEMU:

muriloo@jaspion1:~/sources/qemu$ ./configure --target-list=ppc64-linux-user --disable-system --disable-tools --static

muriloo@jaspion1:~$ uname -a
Linux jaspion1 4.4.0-119-generic #143-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 2 16:08:02 UTC 2018 ppc64le ppc64le ppc64le GNU/Linux

With QEMU from tag v2.12.0-rc4 on Fedora 27 x86_64, it works too.

Thanks for the update,  I will test that version and report back ( it may be a few days)

We recently fixed bug #1696773 which was a cause of various crashes or other problems when trying to run go binaries under linux-user, including "go build hello.go". So I strongly suspect this is a duplicate of that bug. Could you test with the QEMU v4.1.0 rc3 or later, please?


Have you ever tried with a newer version of QEMU?

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
