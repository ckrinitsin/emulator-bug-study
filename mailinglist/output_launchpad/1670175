Prompt is unusable, CPU at 100 %.

Looks like tribblix is an OpenSolaris variant from the above output (I normally tend to test with Milax but it's good to have another reference around).

I spent a lot of time during the 2.8 cycle fixing up the context switch code in OpenBIOS which gets OpenSolaris most of the way. AFAICT the 2 main missing items are:


1) Wiring up the ebus interrupts

I have patches for this, but they cause Linux to panic on startup, presumably because of 2) below.

2) Fix up the /pci nodes, adding 2 PCI bridges to the DT

This will take some thought since OpenBIOS needs to be modified to handle multiple PCI buses and has know bugs with PCI bridges.


The CPU for sun4u machines will always be at 100% because the USIIi processor doesn't have a HLT or equivalent instruction that can be used by the guest to enable QEMU to pause the vCPU whilst idle.

Note that I work on this as time allows, so progress isn't particularly rapid. Offers of sponsorship to enable me to spend more time on this would be gratefully received :)

Hi Mark, thank you for your effort on SPARC64 emulation in QEMU!

Thanks for the explanation on what might be wrong. Is there a way to workaround the PCI problems?

Tribblix is indeed an illumos (a community fork of OpenSolaris) distribution. Contrary to Milax, which looks abandoned to me as OpenSolaris is, Tribblix and DilOS reflect recent illumos development and until OpenIndiana SPARC edition materialize, probably should be a reference solarish (sic) platforms.

As I hope to use qemu-system-sparc64 for automated validation of illumos distributions, currently I am unable to provide anything but testing/QA :).

Let me know should there be anything to test.

With QEMU 2.11 there are two new warnings I haven't seen before (execution was still the same):

...
unix-tte:interpret: exception -13 caught
interpret ' unix-tte is va>tte-data failed with error ffffffffffffffed

...

Then it hangs the same way it did with older QEMUs.

qemu sparc64 also failed to boot Oracle Linux

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.


This is still valid, setting to Confirmed.  With the latest qemu as of today, it fails in a slightly different way, but still does not accept any keyboard input:
