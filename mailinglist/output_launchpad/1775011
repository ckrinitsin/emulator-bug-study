-display gtk,gl=on crashes on Wayland

steps to reproduce:

1. run a Wayland compositor (I use sway, probably the same bug exists for other compositors)
2. execute qemu -display gtk,gl=on

expected results:

a GTK window is created that shows SeaBIOS failing to boot

actual results:

segmentation fault  qemu-system-x86_64 -display gtk,gl=on

additional information:

qemu version 2.12.0 from Arch Linux

looks like qemu is trying to take the Wayland display from GTK and initialize EGL but telling EGL it's a X11 display, which is not correct. setting GDK_BACKEND=x11 works around the issue.

The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.
