TCG test targets missing from 'make check-help'

We can run the TCG tests using:

$ make run-tcg-tests-$TARGET-softmmu

This is not listed in 'make check-help'.


This is an automated cleanup. This bug report has been moved to QEMU's
new bug tracker on gitlab.com and thus gets marked as 'invalid' now.
Please continue with the discussion here:
