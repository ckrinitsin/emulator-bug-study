egl-headless crashes

egl-headless crashes when it is trying change the resolution. After XFCE login, for example.

I tryed it on 2.12, 3.0 and 3.1.0-rc2 versions.

Is it possible to set init resolution when VM is starting?

-device virtio-vga,xres=<width>,yres=<height>

Hi, Gerd.

   Thank you very match! It's work for me.

   Now,  I need to contact with libvirt developers. Libvirt isn't work
   with egl-headless. I'm trying last version (4.9.0)












I mean this works: -device virtio-vga,xres=1920,yres=1080

Not the patch. I try to patch 3.0 version. No result

I have the same issue.  The patch (which is already included in my git source) did not help.  I can use the command line solution but it's not ideal as I connect to the VM from multiple computers with different resolutions.

Also if I use "Auto resize VM to window" the VM immediately crashes with the error:

qemu-system-x86_64: /root/qemu/ui/egl-headless.c:136: egl_scanout_flush: Assertion `surface_width(edpy->ds) == edpy->guest_fb.width' failed.


Otherwise it is working better than I had hoped, just this small resolution issue.


The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be marked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

[Expired for QEMU because there has been no activity for 60 days.]
