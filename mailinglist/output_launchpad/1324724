make install fails if running strip

I do:
   ./configure --target-list=arm-softmmu
   make
  sudo make install

and see:
install -d -m 0755 "/usr/local/bin"
libtool --quiet --mode=install install -c -m 0755 qemu-ga qemu-nbd qemu-img qemu-io  fsdev/virtfs-proxy-helper "/usr/local/bin"
strip "/usr/local/bin/qemu-ga" "/usr/local/bin/qemu-nbd" "/usr/local/bin/qemu-img" "/usr/local/bin/qemu-io" "/usr/local/bin/fsdev/virtfs-proxy-helper"
strip: '/usr/local/bin/fsdev/virtfs-proxy-helper': No such file

Not sure this is really ARM related, is it? It looks like it will happen any time we do a make install and we're using strip and we've built something in some subdir like fsdev.

Looks fairly reasonable to me. I think I'd do both places the same way you did the libexec case, though (without the extra make variable).


The libexec case doesn't actually work, which is why IO switched to a separate variable.  One of the reasons I said the patch is probably wrong.

I suspect we need something like
$(STRIP) $(addprefix $(DESTDIR)/$(BINDIR), $(notdir ${TOOLS)))

And I didn't see the problem on x86_64, only on armhf. I think x86_64 doesn't need the fsdev helper.

This was fixed by commit 0d6594261 back in 2014.
