QEMU Intel HAX Windows

Hi, 

Using the latest exe's from http://qemu.weilnetz.de/w32/

C:\Users\therock247uk\Desktop\jan\qemu-w64-setup-20170113>qemu-system-i386 --enable-hax -m 512 -cdrom C:\Users\therock247uk\Desktop\jan\en_windows_xp_professional_with_service_pack_3_x86_cd_x14-80428.iso
HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virt mode.
Failed to allocate 20000000 memory

The emulator seems to hang/get stuck during booting from the CD taking out --enable-hax allows it to boot.

Which version were you exactly using? Can you still reproduce the problem with the latest version of QEMU?
